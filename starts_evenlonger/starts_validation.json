He was one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement, whose members were often called \"Tractarians\"; they aimed to reform the Church of England by reasserting its links with the early Catholic church.  The college was incorporated by royal charter dated 6 June 1870. Under its terms, the governance of the college was in the hands of the Warden (the head of the college) and a council of nine to twelve members; the Warden could veto almost any decision of the council and so was in a strong position. Other Oxford colleges, in contrast, were run by the head of the college and the Fellows. By keeping matters relating to religion and the college's internal affairs in the hands of the council, rather than college academics (termed Tutors at Keble during this period), the founders hoped to maintain Keble's religious position as \"a bastion of 'orthodox' Anglican teaching\" against the opponents of Tractarianism. The council even had power to move the college away from Oxford (subject to the consent of the Visitor, the Archbishop of Canterbury) if "

I understand the draw of organic produce but I don't see how it's more sustainable.\nbizaromo: A lot of the talk about organic being more sustainable is back-to-nature hype. However, organic farming does have fewer chemical inputs into the land, which causes less strain on the environment. There are tighter restrictions on pesticides, herbicides, and no synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. This is beneficial to the environment because there is less groundwater pollution from organic crops ([nitrogen runoff is a big problem](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fertilizer-runoff-overwhelms-streams/)). Because organic farmers can't just dump on more nitrogen when the soil is depleted, they are more reliant on using crop rotation, compost, cover crops, etc. \n\nAlso, the limits on pesticide use mean that organic farms aren't in an evolutionary arms race of pesticide vs pest...

Today, there is an enhanced emphasis on developing new experimental techniques to capture the local temperature profiles in gases at rarefied conditions. The main underlying reason behind this focus is the interesting physics exhibited by gases at these rarefied conditions, especially in the transition regime. There is the onset of local thermodynamic disequilibrium, which manifests as velocity slip and temperature jump [1-4] at the wall. However, there is limited experimental evidence on understanding these aforementioned phenomena. With the advances in experimental facilities, it is today possible, at least in principle, to map the local temperature profiles in gases at rarefied conditions. Molecular tagging approach is one such technique which has shown the potential to map the temperature profile in low pressure conditions [5]. In molecular tagging approach, a very small percentage of tracer molecules are introduced into the gas of interest, referred as carrier gas. In gas flow studies, the typical tracers employed are acetone and biacetyl. These tracer "

If your rewards are guaranteed, and are guaranteed to be equal, then there's very little motivation to work harder and innovate more, because there's no personal reward from it.\n\nTo provide an example, I'll use chickens and eggs. If you're a farmer with a chicken coop and you make enough eggs(let's say 100 a month as a totally arbitrary number) to fulfill your quotas, off of 20 hours a week of work. You *could* raise more chickens, maybe bump it up to 200 eggs, but why would you? You would need to build a bigger coop, spend more time caring for them, shovel more waste out and more food in, and it's just generally a lot more work.

Roads are paid for in many ways, but mostly through state income tax.\n\n**EDIT:** Wow, I'm glad to see that this started a good discussion.  Yes, the statement was simplified and generalized.  A few notes after reading the comments and other links.\n\n 1) There is most definitely more behind road funding than fuel taxes.\n\n 2) I learned the alleged fact about European road funding when I visited France and I thought it was interesting enough to remember.  I will find a source.\n \n 3) Even if I am wrong about road funding, the difference in tax percentage between US &amp; UK is a **factor of 2**, thus, I'd argue that, "

I can remember a video by some big anime youtuber (I don't remember his name but he had a few hundred thousand subscribers) that was basically him talking about how drawing porn of underage girls was okay because they were just drawings. \n\nBut let's not talk about pedofilia so much.

It has been reported clinically that rupture or dissections in thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) often occur due to hypertension which may be modelled with sudden increase of peripheral resistance, inducing acute changes of blood volumes in the aorta. There is clinical evidence that more compliant aneurysms are less prone to rupture as they can sustain such changes of volume. The aim of the current paper is to verify this paradigm by evaluating computationally the role played by the variation of peripheral resistance and the impact of aortic stiffness onto peak wall stress in ascending TAA. Methods. Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) analyses were performed using patient-specific geometries and boundary conditions derived from 4D MRI datasets acquired on a patient.

We give an algorithm to implement the transform. We show how to use the transform algorithm as a generator of a whole family of inferencing algorithms for circumscription. The method is to employ the transform algorithm as a front end to any inferencing algorithm, e.g., one of the previously available, that handles the parallel (empty) case of prioritization. Our algorithms provide not just coverage of a new expressive class, but also alternatives to previous algorithms for implementing the previously covered class (?layered?) of prioritization. In particular, we give a new query-answering algorithm for prioritized cirumscription which is sound and complete for the full expressive class of unrestricted finite prioritization partial orders, for propositional defaults (or minimized predicates). By contrast, previous algorithms required that the prioritization partial order be layered, i.e., structured similar to the system of rank in the military.

The difference is how long you can stand it and still feel energised by it, not drained by it (like when you're at a party and you suddenly just want to go home lol). Most introverts don't hate socialising, they just get tired of it faster than extroverts and need more time to recharge afterwards. It doesn't have anything to do with our ability to socialise, how \"hyper\" we are or how bad or good we are at making friends etc. That is shyness, and in more serious cases social anxiety (those are also two very different things). Introverts can certainly be shy but they also can be very good at socialising, they're just more selective about the amount of time and the sort of socialising (some might like crazy parties just once in a while, some might just prefer quiet dinners with "

The heating and cooling is also to change the softness/hardness properties of the cooled metal. They way you cool it determines if the molecules form a more lattice like or chaotic configuration. The more lattice like, the more it behaves like a crystal (eg. Diamond super hard but super brittle). The more chaotic the molecules, the softer the metal becomes and as well as more pliable (eg. Lead). The reason we put it in the oven was to hit that sweet spot of hard and flexible so I could use it like a crowbar but still have a sharp knife.

Minor problem is that the basement was rented out so noise was an issue so there's actual insulation between the tiles and the 1st floor joists.

To provide some useful information on how the injury happened:\n\nFirst exercise in the workout I did was pull ups for 5 sets. The sets looked like 8-8-7-7-6 and 8 is the most reps I can do in a set so I was pushing myself pretty hard. This is the first time I tried arch body technique which I think is why the injury happened. Before I had been doing only hollow body pull ups which is more beginner friendly. Hollow body pull ups use more of your lats. Arch body puts more work on your upper back than the lats, which are way bigger so they can take more stress. Anyways, the injury actually occured in my next exercise which was chin ups. It's not because I did pull ups and followed that with chin ups, I have done that many times before with no problems and I used only hollow body technique. So the take away is beginners should only use hollow body and avoid arch body before reaching 10-12 reps of pull ups.

People who score low on a IQ test typically give up on school and life because they believe that they can't do it.

Accumulating data suggest that this poorly understood control depends, at least in part, on Central Carbon Metabolism (CCM). In Bacillus subtilis , the glycolytic pyruvate kinase (PykA) is intricately linked to replication. This 585 amino-acid-long enzyme comprises a catalytic (Cat) domain that binds to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP to produce pyruvate and ATP, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain termed PEPut interacts with Cat and is homologous a domain that, in other metabolic enzymes, are phosphorylated at a conserved TSH motif at the expense of PEP and ATP to drive sugar import and catalytic or regulatory activities. To gain insights into the role of PykA in replication, DNA synthesis was analyzed in various Cat and PEPut mutants grown in a medium where the metabolic activity of PykA is dispensable for growth. Measurements of replication parameters ( ori/ter ratio, C period and fork speed) and of the pyruvate kinase activity showed that PykA mutants exhibit replication defects resulting from side chain modifications in "

Keep in mind that for the everyday person like myself, I'm talking about basic items like shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, styling products, etc.\n\nThere are probably many sites but I live in the USA and have only used Making Cosmetics. While I haven't made my own whole products, I have bought items to replace expensive products. The first thing I bought about 5 years ago was a product to replace a pricey \"wrinkle blurring\" item I'd been using for a while. The name-brand item cost me around $15 for a 7-oz tube. I was able to buy a 15-oz jar of the powder (which lasted me over a year) for about $10 at the time.\n\nBecause I don't know anything about (or have the equipment) for complex formulation of products, I stick with the basics. I buy hair conditioner bases, curl cream bases, skin care oils (to add to existing products), and other simple-to-use additives, and use my home blenders and basic tools to mix things. The last thing I bought was some hydrolyzed silk protein that I add to my hair and skin moisturizers. I also sometimes buy fragrances "

He answered that he understands, and that was it.

The AC dehumidifies the air inside the car, which allows the heat to warm the air faster. I turn my heater all the way up and then also switch the AC on at the same time. It works for defogging and defrosting. I can\u2019t believe I was an adult before I learned about that.\nEducational_Leg36: That's wrong. Humid air holds heat better than dryer air. Ac with the defroster is only to defog the windows, nothing more.\njakaldd: Humid cold air takes longer to heat, which is why the AC is used as part of the defrosting process. Humid cold air is replaced by dry hot air. Humid hot air on cold surfaces will cause fogging to occur, and any moisture able to build up on those surfaces will slow down the defrosting process. So it helps on either fog or frost. I\u2019ve tried it myself and I\u2019ve been doing it for years now. I didn\u2019t "

I introduce a new view, *consciousness semanticism*, that seems to solve the so-called 'hard problem of consciousness' without any contentious appeal to intuition or analogy. The cornerstone of the argument is to notice the vague semantics of definitions of consciousness such as 'what it is like' to be someone and the precise semantics required to have fact-of-the-matter answers to questions like 'Is this entity conscious?' These semantics are incompatible, and thus, I argue we should dismiss this notion of consciousness-as-property. There is still consciousness-as-self-reference (e.g., 'I think, therefore I am'), but this reference is insufficient for such questions, just as saying, 'This object on which I sit is a chair', cannot even with a perfect understanding of physics allow us to categorize objects as chairs and not-chairs.\n\n"

Nevertheless, hardly any approaches to take these identities into account into machine translation models exist so far. A lack of understanding of the socio-technical implications of such technologies risks further reproducing linguistic mechanisms of oppression and mislabelling. In this paper, we describe the methods and results of a workshop on gender-fair language and language technologies, which was led and organised by ten researchers from TU Wien, St. P\\\"olten UAS, FH Campus Wien and the University of Vienna and took place in Vienna in autumn 2021. A wide range of interest groups and their representatives were invited to ensure that the topic could be dealt with holistically. Accordingly, we aimed to include translators, machine translation experts and non-binary individuals (as \"community experts\") on an equal footing. Our analysis shows that gender in machine translation requires a high degree of context sensitivity, that developers of such technologies need to position themselves cautiously "

One is if the left lane is a passing lane only, another is if there is a prohibition to travelling in the left lane. These two are almost the same but slightly different.\n3. The other law, and most misunderstood. A vehicle that is not violating the above laws, and travelling at the speed limit cannot be impeding traffic. The 'flow of traffic' can never be higher than the speed limit (even if it is). The people exceeding the speed limit in this case are in the wrong. \n\nEdit to add: There is no \"correct\" lane for exceeding the speed limit, as that is always illegal. (except for emergency vehicles)\n\nWhat I said above is the legal requirement. That being said, the courteous thing to do, being that traffic is typically exceeding the posted speed limits, "

So, after having looked at a little (and I stress LITTLE) philosophy, I feel like I really would like to get more involved in the ideas that come with it.\n\nYet, like everything, it seems incredibly hard for me to actually start understanding philosophy - I find it hard to even watch Dr. Who because I haven't yet watched the first season - so I guess my question is: Where do I start? \n\nWhat should i read first?

In the present article, we study an important point in more detail, the 'definition' of 'powers' ('$\\delta\\upsilon\\nu\\acute\\alpha\\mu\\epsilon\\iota\\varsigma$'). While in [Brisson-Ofman2], it was shown that the different steps to get the definition are mathematically and philosophically incorrect, it is explained why the definition itself is problematic. However, it is the first example, at least in the trilogy, of a definition by division. This point is generally ignored by modern commentators though, as we will try to show, it gives rise, in a mathematical context, to at least three fundamental questions: the meaning(s) of 'logos', the connection between 'elements and compound' and, of course the question of the 'power(s)'. One of the main consequences of our works on Theaetetus' 'mathematical passage', including the present one, is to challenge the so-called 'main standard interpretation'.

When bouldering, especially outdoors on real rock, the first move from a sit start is often a rather explosive movement upward. Even moving a short distance takes a lot of power. Because sit starts tend to be on overhanging boulders (for the non-climbers here that just means that the rock is beyond vertical), you can't take much weight on the feet. To make the move, you need to pull upward explosively while tensing up your core explosively in order to stay against the rock while you move upwards. Even when I stick these moves, I tend to be pretty gassed out from the exertion and unable to finish the boulder problem. It's extra hard for me b/c I am semi-tall (6'1\"), which means that on sit starts I am very scrunched up and have lots of legs and body in the way or hanging off the rock as I explode upward.\n\nFew gym problems are designed to train this kind of move, but they're super common outdoors.

Bankruptcy is one path but it is has a cost since you need to hire an attorney and go through the court process. That court process is intimidating and public. One viable approach is to simply walk away. Being broke is not criminal and both parties (bank and you) agree from the onset to accept the risks.

Debts connected to auto or real property are secured debts. You can walk away from those, but you'll stand to lose the asset. You can walk away from unsecured debts, and keep everything.

According to the theory, historical events are associated with recurring generational personas (archetypes). Each generational persona unleashes a new era (called a turning) lasting around 20\u201325 years, in which a new social, political, and economic climate (mood) exists. They are part of a larger cyclical \"saeculum\" (a long human life, which usually spans between 80 and 100 years, although some saecula have lasted longer). The theory states that a crisis recurs in American history after every saeculum, which is followed by a recovery (high). During this recovery, institutions and communitarian values are strong. Ultimately, succeeding generational archetypes attack and weaken institutions in the name of autonomy and individualism, which eventually creates a tumultuous political environment that ripens conditions for another crisis.\nStrauss and Howe laid the groundwork for their theory in their book Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 (1991), which discusses the history of the United States as "

The 20th century societies weren't cruel because they were godless.

We propose a mechanism for the boiling crisis that is based on the spreading of the dry spot under a vapor bubble. The spreading is initiated by the vapor recoil force, a force coming from the liquid evaporation into the bubble. Since the evaporation intensity increases sharply near the triple contact line, the influence of the vapor recoil can be described as a change of the apparent contact angle. Therefore, for the most usual case of complete wetting of the heating surface by the liquid, the boiling crisis can be understood as a drying transition from complete to partial wetting. The state of nucleate boiling, which is boiling in its usual sense, is characterized by a very large rate of heat transfer from the heating surface to the bulk because the superheated liquid is carried away from the heating surface by the departing vapor bubbles. If the heating power is increased, the temperature of the heating surface increases with the heat flux. When the heat flux from the heater reaches a threshold value q CHF (the critical heat flux, "

This is in part due to the theoretical prediction of fine-tuned trivial (i.e., non-topological) zero-bias peaks that occur because of uncontrolled quantum dots or disorder potentials. While many aspects of the topological phase can be somewhat fine-tuned because the topological phase space is often small, the quantized height of the ZBCP associated with a Majorana mode is known to be robust at sufficiently low temperatures even as the tunnel barrier is pinched off to vanishingly small normal-state conductance. The key shortcoming of the existing experimental works is an acute lack of stability of the putative Majorana mode features, indicating the probable absence of a topological phase, and the current paper suggests specific experimentally accessible measures for a careful quantitative analysis of the measured ZBCP stability. In this paper, we study how the counter-intuitive robustness of the ZBCP height to the tunnel barrier strength can be used to distinguish Majorana modes from non-topological "

The treasure is placed at a target location by an adversary and the goal is to find it as fast as possible as a function of both k and D, where D is the distance between the central location and the target. This is biologically motivated by cooperative, central place foraging such as performed by ants around their nest. In this type of search there is a strong preference to locate nearby food sources before those that are further away.

In addition to synaptic plasticity and spike frequency adaptation, our model incorporates adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus as well as the difference in size between the neocortex and the hippocampus, that we associate with distance-dependent synaptic plasticity.

Nearly 40% of strokes result in a loss of vision, and up to 1% of the adult population suffers from vision loss due a stroke. This condition is known as [Hemianopia](https://journals.lww.com/jneuro-ophthalmology/fulltext/2006/09000/homonymous_hemianopia_in_stroke.5.aspx) and it cuts your vision in both eyes, on one side of the visual field. However, many people are not aware that strokes can affect your vision, and if your only symptom is vision loss many hospitals will not administer TPA, a drug critical to reversing stroke effects.\n\nThe common expression for recognizing a stroke is FAST - Face, Arm, Speech, Time - which represents three common symptoms and that treating a stroke quickly is critical. However many in the stroke field (myself included) prefer BE FAST, which adds Balance and Eyes to the list of symptoms.\n\nSo, TL;DR - Strokes can affect vision, and you should be aware of the possible signs and symptoms to protect yourself and loved ones.

Interestingly, the planet's parent star is an active, rapidly rotating solar-like star with a large fraction (7 to 20%) of spots. Aims: We want to provide constraints on the properties of the star-planet system and understand whether the planet's inferred large size may be due to a systematic error on the inferred parameters, and if not, how it may be explained. Methods: We combine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available spectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the system parameters. Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling (including spots and stellar activity) that would yield the required ~10% reduction in size for the star and thus the planet. Two classes of solutions are found: the usual main sequence solution for the star yields for the planet a mass of 3.67+/-0.13 Mjup, a radius of 1.55+/-0.03 Rjup for an age that is at least 130Ma, and should be less than 500Ma given the star's fast rotation and significant activity.

If you have ever been through New York then you understand you can sometimes spend 20 mins just trying to get through this area in your car.

Therefore, transferring existing static analyses to another DSL incurs a huge implementation overhead. However, this overhead is not always intrinsically necessary: in many cases, while the concepts of the DSL on which a static analysis is performed are domain-specific, the underlying algorithm employed in the analysis is actually domain-independent and thus can be reused in principle, depending on how it is specified.

Clarke and science fiction as a whole for the sake of argument, but it could be anyone or any genre. \n\n1. I can't speak for the entire US of A, but at my high school and middle school, every year we would read a different play by William Shakespeare every year, often spending weeks at a time on our \"Shakespeare unit.\" This took away from time we could have spent on other great authors and genres. Not once did we read any science fiction, and this entire genre is essentially left out of the curriculum. Issac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and Robert Heinlein are never even mentioned. It is possible to make the case that most of their books are too advanced for every high school/middle school students, but what about Orson Scott Card, Orson Wells, HG Wells, Ray Bradbury, or George Orwell?

A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is an artificial software language tailored for a particular application domain. Usually, DSL users are domain experts that may not have a software engineering background. As a consequence, they might not be familiar with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Thus, the development of tools that offer different interfaces for interacting with a DSL is relevant. Inquiry: However, resources available to DSL designers are limited. We would like to leverage tools used to interact with general purpose languages in the context of DSLs. Computational notebooks are an example of such tools. Then, our main question is: What is an efficient and effective method of designing and implementing notebook interfaces for DSLs? By addressing this question we might be able to speed up the development of DSL tools, and ease the interaction between end-users and DSLs.

She might have gotten 8-10 of that, and 2 of it went to gas.\n\nAs much as I hate tipping culture, many riders don't tip because they think their driver is making a lot. You may have paid 50, but your driver is barely scraping by. If you always tip at restaurants, consider tipping your driver too \u2014 or putting pressure on rideshare companies to change their take (because you're getting ripped off too).\n\nEdit: FYI that rideshares\u2019 business model is like waiters/waitresses.

Serious infections caused by dogs are quite rare, the case you linked to is a pretty unusual incident.  It's worth noting that you can theoretically get flesh eating bacteria from a handrail in many US cities, so unless you want to get rid of all handrails too, I'm not sure how this justifies the extermination of an entire species.\n\nSecond, dogs are used for way more than just hunting.  Aside from the obvious fact that people see enormous benefit in simply having dogs as companions, dogs also serve as guides for the blind, aids to people with disabilities, can detect seizures and panic attacks before they hit and warn their owners, help screen for toxic and harmful substances (bomb sniffing dogs), can be used to herd and protect livestock, and can even detect cancer and other conditions in humans.

Significant differences remain between scientific fields such as astrophysics, anthropology, chemistry and medieval history, despite their shared commitment to describing dynamic processes and changes of state.

Unsupervised learning algorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in latent spaces and/or clustering the nodes. Both focus on extracting knowledge from graph topologies. While most existing techniques are only applicable to static graphs, where edges do not evolve through time, recent developments have shown that they could be extended to deal with evolving networks. In a supervised context, one generally aims at inferring labels or numerical values attached to nodes using both the graph and, when they are available, node characteristics. Balancing the two sources of information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally or globally.

Sharing knowledge about the products or services which people have the liberty to purchase is one thing. However, using selective quotes with no regard to context, or framing perceived faults in a way that prevents the producer of a good or service to present themselves fairly in the market, are tools of cancel culture which destroy the market in favor of bullying all perceived non-compliant members out of contention. \n\nThe problem with cancel culture is that a sufficiently vocal group of self-identified victims can find any pretense on which to cancel those with whom they disagree politically, not necessarily those who are morally wrong.\nKraftySOT: But from what are you "

The work of Christopher Alexander is familiar to many computer scientists: for some it's patterns, for some it's the mystical **quality without a name** and \"Nature of Order\"; for many more it's \"Notes on the Synthesis of Form\" -- Alexander's formalized design method and foreshadowing ideas about cohesion and coupling in software. Since the publication of \"Design Patterns\" by Gamma et al. in 1994, there have been hundreds of books published about design / software patterns, thousands of published pattern languages, and tens of thousands of published patterns. \"Notes,\" published in 1964, was quickly followed by one of Alexander's most important essays, \"A City is Not a Tree,\" in which he repudiates the formal method described in \"Notes,\" and his Preface to the paperback edition of \"Notes\" in 1971 repeats the repudiation.

Two stories plus an unfinished basement.  In our previous (much smaller) house (just a couple miles away), we placed a window-mounted evaporative (swamp) cooler (a \"MasterCool\", IIRC) in the window well of an egress window of an unused basement bedroom.  It worked amazingly well for us, and we'd like to replicate the effect in this house.\n\nHowever, we've got a bunch of complications.\n\n* We'd like to avoid installing a cooler on the roof.  We'd prefer ground-level access for maintenance, etc.\n\n* We'd like to avoid unnecessary noise in the living areas.  So, going directly through the wall into the living room isn't something we'd want to do.\n\n* The windows in the basement are not large enough for egress (and I'm not quite ready to bite off that project--which is likely going to require a future post).

        "text": "In this paper we propagate a large deviations approach for proving limit theory for (generally) multivariate time series with heavy tails. We make this notion precise by introducing regularly varying time series. We provide general large deviation results for functionals acting on a sample path and vanishing in some neighborhood of the origin. We study a variety of such functionals, including large deviations of random walks, their suprema, the ruin functional, and further derive weak limit theory for maxima, point processes, cluster functionals and the tail empirical process. One of the main results of this paper concerns bounds for the ruin probability in various heavy-tailed models including GARCH, stochastic volatility models and solutions to stochastic recurrence equations. 1. Preliminaries and basic motivation In the last decades, a lot of efforts has been put into the understanding of limit theory for dependent sequences, including Markov chains (Meyn and Tweedie [42]), weakly dependent sequences (Dedecker et al.

Choosing a neural network architecture for any task is as complex as searching the space of those functions. For the last few years, 'neural architecture design' has been largely synonymous with 'neural architecture search' (NAS), i.e. brute-force, large-scale search. NAS has yielded significant gains on practical tasks. However, NAS methods end up searching for a local optimum in architecture space in a small neighborhood around architectures that often go back decades, based on CNN or LSTM. In this work, we present a different and complementary approach to architecture design, which we term 'zero-shot architecture design' (ZSAD). We develop methods that can predict, without any training, whether an architecture will achieve a relatively high test or training error on a task after training. We then go on to explain the error in terms of the architecture definition itself and develop tools for modifying the architecture based on this explanation. This confers an unprecedented level of control on the deep learning practitioner. They can make informed design decisions before the first line of code is written, "

To get the same pressure from water as a typical countertop sealer does from atmospheric pressure, you'd have to submerge your bag to about 20 feet, or more than twice the depth of a typical in-ground backyard pool. (32.8 feet would be needed to achieve a full atmosphere difference - but then again, a countertop vacuum sealer would have to draw a perfect vacuum in order to get a 1 atmo gradient).\n\nSo because of the minuscule amount of pressure supplied, the water method will still leave plenty of air in the bag - it'll just be trapped as smaller bubbles around and within the food.

In fact I find it disturbing that we have been apportioning congresspeople to areas based on the population of both citizens and illegal immigrants.

People who score low on a IQ test typically give up on school and life because they believe that they can't do it.

I just want to mention to people that IQ shouldn't determine your outcome. \n\nI mean IQ doesn't really measure everything that has to do with intelligence.

Being a paper scientist the author refers to the sheet of paper which is a stochastic fibrous set whose porous texture can be considered as an archetype for many natural or artificial human structures. The paper properties are correlated with its texture by taking account the effect of chance occurring during its manufacturing process. The theoretical developments, the formalism and the application methods presented in this study have a general significance beyond the only paper material.A specific property of sets of objects randomly unorderly distributed in space is their interfaces orientation distribution. This distribution is usually obtained by the analysis of images sampled in the object sets. The density of orientation probability of the fibers or of the texture interfaces, weighted by their length or by their area, can be interpreted as the radius of curvature of an outline or of a warped surface which characterizes, from a global and statistical point of view, the texture geometry in two "

I introduce a new view, *consciousness semanticism*, that seems to solve the so-called 'hard problem of consciousness' without any contentious appeal to intuition or analogy. The cornerstone of the argument is to notice the vague semantics of definitions of consciousness such as 'what it is like' to be someone and the precise semantics required to have fact-of-the-matter answers to questions like 'Is this entity conscious?' These semantics are incompatible, and thus, I argue we should dismiss this notion of consciousness-as-property. There is still consciousness-as-self-reference (e.g., 'I think, therefore I am'), but this reference is insufficient for such questions, just as saying, 'This object on which I sit is a chair', cannot even with a perfect understanding of physics allow us to categorize objects as chairs and not-chairs.\n\n"

You couldn't make it, or distribute it, but if you had it saved all you really had to say was \"I got it from some other guy\" and send police off in another direction. Obviously this is problematic, and it becomes hard to accurately enforce a law like this. Recently they passed a law that banned possession too, bringing Japan in line with most of the world. However, in the interest of protecting freedom of expression they made it clear that animated comics, 3D images/video and OVAs featuring animated minors were not criminalized.\n\nNow, I think we all agree that there's a big difference between animated pics and the real deal.

Because you don't have enough volume of blood, its harder for your body to maintain blood flow. This causes your body to mimic the symptoms of depression (fatigue, brain fog, dizziness), which can cause you to think the depressed thoughts, causing your brain to make depression chemicals. When that makes you feel shitty enough, your heart will try to fix it by beating harder, raising your blood pressure, mimicking anxiety. Additionally, it becomes harder for your blood to carry oxygen, making you breathe harder, which for me is the one that causes me to panic.\n\nThis isn't a WoW tHaNkS iM cUrEd, but for me personally makes a huge difference.

So, after having looked at a little (and I stress LITTLE) philosophy, I feel like I really would like to get more involved in the ideas that come with it.\n\nYet, like everything, it seems incredibly hard for me to actually start understanding philosophy - I find it hard to even watch Dr. Who because I haven't yet watched the first season - so I guess my question is: Where do I start? \n\nWhat should i read first? What shouldn't I read until later? Where should I pick philosophy up? I'm not doing this formally in any degree, but I would like to understand philosophy thoroughly. So where do I start?\n\nCheers Redditors! \nJamieHugo: This will be a rough and probably too cliched summary of the path of many philosophy students, but it's a good path, and will take you along most of the major problems and defining periods of philosophy. Philosophers read a lot of books, and there is a huge canon out there for the general field "

Most friendships I've made in my life were on the internet, and when they were real life friendships, they were kept thanks to online interaction (e.g. group of friends playing the same multiplayer game).

In such cases, the monotonicity assumptions that are frequently made in the theory of mean field games do not hold, and uniqueness cannot be expected in general. Such model lead to systems of forward-backward nonlinear nonlocal parabolic equations; the latter are supplemented with various kinds of boundary conditions, in particular Neumann-like boundary conditions stemming from reflection conditions on the underlying controled stochastic processes. The present work deals with numerical approximations of the above mentioned systems. After describing the finite difference scheme, we propose an iterative method for solving the systems of nonlinear equations that arise in the discrete setting; it combines a continuation method, Newton iterations and inner loops of a bigradient like solver. The numerical method is used for simulating two examples. We also make experiments on the behaviour of the iterative algorithm "

When bouldering, especially outdoors on real rock, the first move from a sit start is often a rather explosive movement upward. Even moving a short distance takes a lot of power. Because sit starts tend to be on overhanging boulders (for the non-climbers here that just means that the rock is beyond vertical), you can't take much weight on the feet. To make the move, you need to pull upward explosively while tensing up your core explosively in order to stay against the rock while you move upwards. Even when I stick these moves, I tend to be pretty gassed out from the exertion and unable to finish the boulder problem. It's extra hard for me b/c I am semi-tall (6'1\"), which means that on sit starts I am very scrunched up and have lots of legs and body in the way or hanging off the rock as I explode upward.\n\nFew gym problems are designed to train this kind of move, but they're super common outdoors.

If we run two things at once, like the fill cycle on the washer and an outside spigot our pressure will drop to 0. The pressure tank is new and it seems to still be holding pressure fine.\n\nI believe it's a deep well, I thought I had gotten some papers when I bought the house showing it to be a little over 100'.\n\nOne place quoted me $1000 for a new 1/2 HP installed. She had said since I have a smaller pressure tank all I needed is the 1/2 HP. Is this true is bigger not always better? I plan on living here a while and wouldn't mind spending the extra on a 1 HP if it would help. If it makes a difference I'm on some acreage and have some no freeze spigots. The furthest is about 200 yards from the well. \n\nIf I do it myself I can get a 1 HP for $400-600.  The well people that gave me the quote said it was an hour labor. I figure at least double that for a first timer. I was talking to some people about it and it does seem like it's much more than pulling the old one out and dropping the new one in. \nConcretia: How long does it take for your pump kick on when using water "

The name also applies to at least three other forts built at almost the same location, one during the Texas Revolution, and two during the Civil War.\nIn response to fear of annexation of Texas by the United States during the era of Mexican Texas, the Mexican Congress passed the Law of April 6, 1830, which halted legal immigration by Americans and established military occupation.  Initially, sporadic efforts were made to establish a customs post at this location in 1830 and then again in 1831, but these efforts were less than successful.  As a result, \"Fortaleza de Velasco\" was erected in April to May 1832 by the order of General Ter\u00e1n to enforce the customs and immigration provisions of the new law for the customs port of entry.\nThe original Fort Velasco has been briefly described in several first-hand or contemporaneous accounts.  William J. Russell wrote \u201c\u2026 The plan and structure of the fort were well understood, of circular form, "

But standing around for 3-5 minutes after every set feels like a massively suboptimal use of time. In the past I've been more hypertrophy focused where the rest times are shorter, and I'd also superset all the exercises, so I basically end up with \\~30-45 seconds rest between exercises in a superset, which I'd typically fill with in-place jogging or step-ups or something to keep my heart-rate up, which I found lead to a significant increase in stamina through the workout. I actually started off doing supersets with strength-focused workouts, but I found this to be too taxing. Maybe this is a matter of conditioning? I'm not sure. Currently I'm trying to fill the time with either stretching or light cardio.\n\nSo my question to you all, is, in your strength focused workouts / exercises, what do you do with your 3-5 minutes? Do you superset with something else? Cardio? "

So incredible, it's actually kind of hard for me to believe. Although I want to believe this is true, simply because of how incredible it is.\n\nMay I ask how your form was?

        "text": "[deleted]: \"Building\" a personality\n[deleted]\nEarls_Basement_Lolis: This idea is inspired by Jungian psychotherapy, but essentially you have the self, the persona, the shadow, and the anima/animus. The self is what you are born as where the persona is how you portray yourself to society. The persona is what you develop in order to better relate to society. It contains all of the positive traits that are socialized into you and reinforced where it casts away traits that society doesn't like. You can look at the persona as a tree that casts a larger shadow the taller that it grows. The shadow is a part of your personality that ends up neglected and unused where it slowly corrodes your character and splits your personality. Jung thought that the best way to be a \"complete\" personality was to integrate the shadow with the persona, which is essentially finding ways to funnel and vent the shadow's tendencies into your persona so that you stop being a face and start being a personality. \n\nThe simplest application of this is learning to integrate aggression into your personality. As you might imagine, just beating people up or being physically abusive isn't a popular trait in society though "
