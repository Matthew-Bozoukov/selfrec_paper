That's my problem with Confederate monuments: their only claim to fame was defending the perpetuation of the greatest system of injustice ever seen in North America. Compare to someone like Jefferson, who accomplished a lot both intellectually and politically, yet also held slaves; yes, there's an irony in writing \"we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal\" while his own biological children were slaves, but the principle stands on its own merits regardless of the particular hypocrisy of the speaker, and we can still respect the speaker for writing the words.\n\nColumbus is a little different: he arrived somewhere already inhabited by people and claimed it discovered... because the people there I guess weren't people, and the people he reported his discovery to were people. That's a little... odd, Euro-centric for sure, but I'll give him that. But he also set the example for centuries to come: genocide, violence, pillaging, he made the Vikings look tame.\n\nI "

Banning alcohol flat-out would only cause problems and probably more than I know of, but my opinion is that the 'culture' we have built around alcohol in western society (I'm Western European, if anyone's interested) is very toxic to our every day life and especially children growing up. \n\nMy background preceding this view is, I think, important. So I'll start of with that. I grew up in a small village where alcohol and straight alcoholism is not treated as much of a big deal. In fact, people fail to recognize alcholism and problem-drinkers so extremely much that my own mother has grown up into extreme alcoholism without ever getting the help she has been needing for over at least 40 years. It has affected both herself and those close to her, including me. She has recently confessed to me that her problem had been going on for this long and that the people around her in her youth (my guess would be early 20's) thought her attitude towards alcohol was cool. \n\nThis is not rare. Especially villages have the risk of getting into "

Both windows have been validated at low power, showing good agreement between measured and modeling, with a return loss better than 32 dB and an insertion loss below 0.05 dB. This paper reports on the window RF design and the low power measurements. The high power tests up to 500kW have been carried out in March 2013 in collaboration with NFRI. Results of these tests are also reported. In the current ITER LHCD design, 20 MW Continuous Wave (CW) of Radio-Frequency power at 5 GHz are expected to be generated and transmitted to the plasma. In order to separate the vacuum vessel pressure from the cryostat waveguide pressure, forty eight 5 GHz 500kW CW windows are to be assembled on the waveguides at the equatorial port flange. For nuclear safety reasons, forty eight additional windows could be located in the cryostat section, to separate and monitor the cryostat waveguide "

What if you could change a computers behavior by observing it.\nThis is a hypothesis that has many philosophical and scientific questions.\n\nBefore proceeding, it is a good idea to be familiar with [logic gates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate) and [the double-slit experiment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc). I want to combine the understanding of these two things to reveal a new possible application of them.\n\nFirst, consider the 'double-slit experiment'. We have the multiple array of lines produced by the electrons when there is no observer present; we can call this the *default state* or just the *'b' state*. So when the observer *is* watching and we get two lines produced on the wall we can call this the *'x' state*.\n\nNow with logic gates, depending on the input you can always expect a certain outcome. *eg* an AND gate will ALWAYS be turned on when its two inputs are activated. And when you consider multiple gates in a circuit then you can always expect a predictable cascade of reactions depending on the initial inputs AND depending on the way the circuit was wired. Hopefully you see what Im getting at here.\n\nNow, lets say we did the 'double-slit "

Although ubiquitous, developing IoT systems remains challenging. Inquiry: A recent field study with 194 IoT developers identifies debugging as one of the main challenges faced when developing IoT systems. This comes from the lack of debugging tools taking into account the unique properties of IoT systems such as non-deterministic data, and hardware restricted devices. On the one hand, offline debuggers allow developers to analyse post-failure recorded program information, but impose too much overhead on the devices while generating such information. Furthermore, the analysis process is also time-consuming and might miss contextual information relevant to find the root cause of bugs. On the other hand, online debuggers do allow debugging a program upon a failure while providing contextual information (e.g., stack trace). In particular, remote online debuggers enable debugging of devices without physical access to them. However, they experience debugging interference due to network delays which complicates "

Don't use boxes unless you absolutely can't avoid it; they just waste room. Furniture is too expensive to ship so just buy new stuff when you get there. Get a blow up bed for the short term because they're comfortable and fold up small.  \nFor the journey, get two small baking soda boxes for the fridge to keep your car smelling fresh. Book all your lodgings in advance, be sure to ask about security.  \nWhen you get where you're going and get moved in, go find a library. They usually have free wifi so you can look stuff up there while you wait for your internet connection to turn on. Also cool people visit the library and you might make a friend, and there's always information about community events for you to go to. Don't immediately "

The difference is that culture was, as is today, shoehorned into the role of a blanket term for national/religious identies, which are still as non-uniform as the people of any given nation.

Atomic and molecular line emissions from shocks may provide valuable information on the injection of mechanical energy in the interstellar medium (ISM), the generation of turbulence, and the processes of phase transition between the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) and the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM).Aims. In this series of papers, we investigate the properties of shocks propagating in the WNM. Our objective is to identify the tracers of these shocks, use them to interpret ancillary observations of the local diffuse matter, and provide predictions for future observations. Methods. Shocks propagating in the WNM are studied using the Paris-Durham shock code, a multi-fluid model built to follow the thermodynamical and chemical structures of shock waves, at steady-state, in a plane-parallel geometry. The code, already designed to take into account the impact of an external radiation field, is updated to treat self-irradiated shocks at intermediate ($30<V_S <100$ km s$^{-1}$) and high velocity ($V_S \\ge 100$ km s$^{-1}$) which emit ultraviolet (UV), extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), and X-ray photons.

Confidence is there to support you in your endeavors, but by itself, confidence does nothing. \n\nPoint #3: From #2, we can see that increasing confidence in general is an absolutely meaningless goal. With nothing to attach raw confidence to, it's impossible interpret your progress. If the results of your actions are constantly used as a barometer for your confidence, you'll live in a state of perpetual self doubt. \n\n\nIn reality, **you already have confidence.** You use it every day.

Turns out a lot of medical techniques on TV are.\n\nWhen the heart stops beating, circulation stops and the brain starves of oxygen.  If that goes on too long, brain damage occurs.  By doing chest compressions, you are pressing on the heart (which is basically a one-way valve), simulating a pump, and forcing precious blood to the brain.\n\nA set of 30 chest compressions are recommended between breaths, but it takes about 15 just to get the blood circulating again.  It's not uncommon for a patient to go into cardiac arrest, fall unconscious from lack of oxygen, be given CPR, and become conscious again--only to lose consciousness once more when the CPR stops.\n\nThe whole point is to keep the brain alive until someone arrives with a defibrillator.  *That* is designed to get the heart beating normally again.\n\nSo if you ever find yourself desperately trying to give someone CPR because you saw it done on TV, don't do any of that crap like "

I tried doing the exercise against the floor. My issue is that I can't even do that, so I searched for alternatives.

If anyone has had a similar problem and found doing something helped alleviate it, please let me know what you did.\neshlow: Foam roller is good, but you really need to hang out in the same position for about a minute or two (sometimes more) and do some deep breathing to allow the joints/muscles to relax and gain the extension.\n\nCat-camels "

Nearly 40% of strokes result in a loss of vision, and up to 1% of the adult population suffers from vision loss due a stroke. This condition is known as [Hemianopia](https://journals.lww.com/jneuro-ophthalmology/fulltext/2006/09000/homonymous_hemianopia_in_stroke.5.aspx) and it cuts your vision in both eyes, on one side of the visual field. However, many people are not aware that strokes can affect your vision, and if your only symptom is vision loss many hospitals will not administer TPA, a drug critical to reversing stroke effects.\n\nThe common expression for recognizing a stroke is FAST - Face, Arm, Speech, Time - which represents three common symptoms and that treating a stroke quickly is critical. However many in the stroke field (myself included) prefer BE FAST, which adds Balance and Eyes to the list of symptoms.\n\nSo, TL;DR - Strokes can affect vision, and you should be aware of the possible signs and symptoms to protect yourself and loved ones.

Kids are much smarter than most people give them credit for. Negative behavior usually comes from somewhere. The idea that hitting a child who has misbehaved is ok, yet hitting an adult who has misbehaved is cruel and/or unusual just compounds the absurdity. Talk of emergency: kids pick up on the emotional/behavioral cues of the parent.  Mom and dad freaking out and talking loudly, saying no no no will get the point across.\n\nSorry, I'm on my phone, but effective discipline is based, how we do it, on explaining expectations, explaining consequences, and following through with consistency. The \"time out\" is not a punishment, but literally a time for the kid to get out of the poor behavior pattern and begin to relax. Discussion happens going into and coming out of time out. The result, when done calmly and consistently, is a kid who learns how to breathe and think through problems, and then talk them through.\n\n"

The coreshine phenomenon, a scattering process at 3.6 and 4.5 $\\mu$m that dominates absorption, has revealed its ability to explore the densest parts of clouds. We want to use this effect to constrain the dust parameters. The goal is to investigate to what extent grain growth (at constant dust mass) inside molecular clouds is able to explain the coreshine observations. We aim to find dust models that can explain a sample of Spitzer coreshine data. We also look at the consistency with near-infrared data we obtained for a few clouds. Methods. We selected four regions with a very high occurrence of coreshine cases: Taurus-Perseus, Cepheus, Chameleon and L183/L134. We built a grid of dust models and investigated the key parameters to reproduce the general trend of surface bright- nesses and intensity ratios of both coreshine and near-infrared observations with the help of a 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code.

As far as I'm concerned, Coyne's conclusion still stands. Ultimately, the human body is a massive complex machine. Our brain is made of atoms that respond to physical stimuli. \nConsider the following: When you drink alcohol, the alcohol effects the molecules in your brain. As a result, you become drunk. Doesn't being drunk affect your \"free will\"? Consciousness is all in the brain. \nIf there is a factor called \"free will\" that affects your decisions, then where does it come from? Your own brain? But the brain is just a machine.

Then I would make the walls out of reclaimed pallet wood. Where I live, free pallets are a dime a dozen, so the walls should be mostly the cost of the two-bys.

Central to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many possible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually requires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the coalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it was formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a combination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one coalition, and by which the overall outcome of the system is maximized. However, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging due to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows exponentially with the number of agents involved.

It is a measure of the bactericidal activity of a chemical compound in relation to phenol. When listed numerically, the figure expressing the disinfecting power of a substance by relating it to the disinfecting power of phenol may be a function of the standardized test performed.  For example, the Rideal\u2013Walker method, introduced in 1903 gives a Rideal\u2013Walker coefficient and the U.S. Department of Agriculture method gives a U.S. Department of Agriculture coefficient.\nTo calculate phenol coefficient, the concentration of phenol at which the compound kills the test organism in 10 minutes, but not in 5 minutes, is divided by the concentration of the test compound that kills the organism under the same conditions (or, probably more common, dividing the dilution factor at which the tested substance shows activity by the dilution factor at which phenol shows comparable activity). The Rideal\u2013Walker test was widely used, but the test conditions chosen were unrealistic, and impossibly high values for the coefficient were claimed by disinfectant manufacturers.

Arundell had already been created a Count of the Holy Roman Empire by Rudolph II in December 1595 (see below). He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He fought as a Royalist in the Civil War and was mortally wounded at the Battle of Stratton in 1643. His son, the third Baron, was implicated in the Popish Plot and imprisoned in the Tower of London for six years. However, after the accession of James II he was restored to favour and served as Lord Privy Seal from 1687 to 1688. His great-great-great-grandson, the eighth Baron (the title having descended from father to son), was an avid collector of art and accumulated immense debts in building and furnishing New Wardour Castle.\nHe had no sons and was succeeded by his cousin, the ninth Baron.

This type of formalism allows the analytical treatment of economic models with an arbitrary number of agents, while preserving the system's interactions and microeconomic features of the individual level.We apply this methodology to model the interactions between financial markets and the real economy, described in a classical framework of a large number of heterogeneous agents, investors and firms. Firms are spread among sectors but may shift between sectors to improve their returns. They compete by producing differentiated goods and reward their investors by paying dividends and through their stocks' valuation. Investors invest in firms and move along sectors based on firms' expected long-run returns.The field-formalism model derived from this framework allows for collective states to emerge. We show that the number of firms in each sector depends on the aggregate financial capital invested in the sector and its firms' expected long-term returns.

However, I see there is a general consensus that barbell exercises are much better for the lower body. Having known that, I was thinking if there was a way in which I can incorporate sandbags into my leg workout. I've taken a look at the Bulgarian sandbag, but the fact that most of them weigh up to 50 pounds with no way to add weight on makes it seem less viable in my opinion. Also, for deadlifts, I've looked at some VERY cheap sand at [Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.ca/product/king-construction-sand-30kg/902210) which seems amazing, but ~67 LBS still seems pretty low for a beginner trying to progress as fast as possible during the \"noob gainz\" phase. It may be great for starting, but where do I go from there to progress? Do you guys have any creative ideas to maybe load two of the sand bags in one? What type of bag can hold 100+ LBS of sand?

Instead of selecting a priori these populations, we propose to objectively construct homologous populations from multivariate analyses. We have undertaken multivariate cluster and cladistic analyses of a sample of 56 low-redshift galaxy clusters containing 699 early-type galaxies, using four parameters: effective radius, velocity dispersion, surface brightness averaged over effective radius, and Mg2 index. All our analyses are consistent with seven groups that define separate regions on the global fundamental plane, not across its thickness.

In a viral marketing campaign, a firm initially targets a small set of pioneers and hopes that they would influence a sizeable fraction of the population by diffusion of influence through the network. In general, any marketing campaign might fail to go viral in the first try. As such, it would be useful to have some guide to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign and judge whether it is worthy of further resources, and in case the campaign has potential, how to hit upon a good pioneer who can make the campaign go viral. In this paper, we present a diffusion model developed by enriching the generalized random graph (a.k.a. configuration model) to provide insight into these questions. We offer the intuition behind the results on this model, rigorously proved in Blaszczyszyn & Gaurav(2013), and illustrate them here by taking examples of random networks having prototypical degree distributions - Poisson degree distribution, which is commonly used as a kind of benchmark, and Power Law degree distribution, "

This version starred Jean Arthur as Peter Pan, Boris Karloff in the dual roles of George Darling and Captain Hook, and Marcia Henderson as Wendy. The show was orchestrated by Trude Rittmann and Hershy Kay and conducted by Benjamin Steinberg. The show ran for 321 performances, closing on January 27, 1951.\nThe production was initially intended as a full-blown musical, with Bernstein composing a complete score for it, but was staged with only five songs \u2013 \"Who Am I?\", \"Pirate's Song\", \"Plank Round\", \"Build My House\", and \"Peter Peter\" \u2013 to accommodate the limited vocal ranges of the principals.\nIn 1998, conductor Alexander Frey began research into whether there may have existed more material that Bernstein had composed for Peter Pan.

But standing around for 3-5 minutes after every set feels like a massively suboptimal use of time. In the past I've been more hypertrophy focused where the rest times are shorter, and I'd also superset all the exercises, so I basically end up with \\~30-45 seconds rest between exercises in a superset, which I'd typically fill with in-place jogging or step-ups or something to keep my heart-rate up, which I found lead to a significant increase in stamina through the workout. I actually started off doing supersets with strength-focused workouts, but I found this to be too taxing. Maybe this is a matter of conditioning? I'm not sure. Currently I'm trying to fill the time with either stretching or light cardio.\n\nSo my question to you all, is, in your strength focused workouts / exercises, what do you do with your 3-5 minutes?

Next time you're way too eager for a hot cookie and obliterate your mouth with its delicious, piping hot gooeyness, be sure to cure it with sugar. \n\nThis trick works every time for me-- I'm fairly certain it has something to do with the enzyme amylase, which digests sugars in your mouth.

Be extremely generous with the sugar. \n\n-Keep your mouth open/ tongue out, because this ensures that the sugar stays put and doesn't get swallowed. \n\nAfter about a minute, or longer if you wish, you're pretty much good to go.

We have developed a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) excitation model that includes the entire energy structure of CH+, i.e. taking into account the pumping of its vibrational and bound and unbound electronic states by near-infrared and optical photons. The model includes the theoretical cross-sections of nonreactive collisions with H, H2, He, and e-, and a Boltzmann distribution is used to describe the probability of populating the excited levels of CH+ during its chemical formation by hydrogenation of C+.

Insulin, released by the pancreas, is the hormone the body uses to take sugar out of the blood (where it is transported) and into cells that need it. This is usually skeletal muscle cells - so your muscles. Most things that you eat are converted into glucose (sugar) for use the body.

The word \"diabetes\" comes from Greek, and it literally means excessive discharge of urine. This is one of the symptoms of diabetes. The excess urination (polyuria) is due to high sugar levels in the blood. High sugar is actually toxic to the individual, so the body - specifically kidneys- attempts to rid the elevated glucose levels, and its end product is urination.

The fluorescence intensity of the stained cells correlates with the amount of DNA they contain. As the DNA content doubles during the S phase, the DNA content (and thereby intensity of fluorescence) of cells in the G0 phase and G1 phase (before S), in the S phase, and in the G2 phase and M phase (after S) identifies the cell cycle phase position in the major phases (G0/G1 versus S versus G2/M phase) of the cell cycle. The cellular DNA content of individual cells is often plotted as their frequency histogram to provide information about relative frequency (percentage) of cells in the major phases of the cell cycle.\nCell cycle anomalies revealed on the DNA content frequency histogram are often observed after different types of cell damage, for example such DNA damage that interrupts the cell cycle progression at certain checkpoints.

This phenomenon is phased-matched through the relative phase detuning between the intracavity fields associated with the two principal polarization modes of the cavity. Our experimental investigation is based on a 12-m long fiber ring resonator in which a polarization controller is inserted to finely control the level of intra-cavity birefringence. Depending on the amount of birefringence, the temporal patterns generated via PMI are found to be either stationary or to exhibit a period-doubled dynamics. Experimental results are in good agreement with numerical simulations based on an Ikeda map for the two orthogonally polarized modes. Our study provides new insights into the control of modulation instability in multimode Kerr resonators. Modulation instability (MI) is a nonlinear phenomenon characterized by the exponential growth and evolution of periodic perturbations on top of an intense continuous-wave (cw) laser beam [1, 2].

One such type of application is *prosumer* applications, which are distributed applications that both produce and consume many events. We analyse the problems that occur when using a reactive programming language or framework to implement prosumer applications. We find that the assumption of an open network, which means prosumers of various types spontaneously join and leave the network, can cause a lot of code complexity or run-time inefficiency. At the basis of these issues lies *acquaintance management*: the ability to discover prosumers as they join and leave the network, and correctly maintaining this state throughout the reactive program. Most existing reactive programming languages and frameworks have limited support for managing acquaintances, resulting in accidental complexity of the code or inefficient computations. In this paper we present acquaintance management for reactive programs. First, we design an *acquaintance discovery* mechanism to create a *flock* that automatically discovers prosumers on the network. An important "

And tracing every case has shown to be difficult due to so many being asymptotic.\n\nIn the end, won't this lead to them having to keep the country in more or less lockdown until a vaccine arrives? Which could be years as I have understood it.\nMortalForce: You're right. We've been locked down for 6 weeks now. Incoming travellers are required to isolate for 2 weeks in a facility. However, we have such a small population that it's quite easy to track cases, and points of contact.  We will get rid of every case, because our high testing rate and huge awareness campaign has meant that people have been calling emergency services, the covid 19 helpline, and non emergency police contacts to get police to break up gatherings etc.\nmattyyboyy86: But is being in lock down indefinitely a good thing?\nnightraindream: I don't think NZ will "

What I mean by that is just that for every effect, there is a cause. Every effect is preceded by a cause that is causally linked to the effect. Therefore, there is a causal relationship between causes and their effects. This is not to be confused with a correlation. The well-known phrase \u201ccorrelation does not equal causation\u201d is extremely important here. Two things can be correlated with absolutely no causal relationship linking the two. The problem is that oftentimes people observe a correlation and automatically assume that they are causally related. I think this is one of the things that leads to belief in superstition.

Meaning, isn't that newborn in a state of pure naturalness where it neither wants to gain nor loose anything? It comes out with a sense of nothing and is only taught silently how to breathe, which ultimately counteracts the bringing of death. It is silently taught how to laugh, smile, have emotions, ect. by just being itself. Well when we ask a question like, \"Why are we here?\" we must answer it rhetorically to get the full idea out of it. So instead we say, \"why are we not here?\" well good question. why are we not over there, or under here? because if we wanted to be over there, we would have to walk.Once we are there, we can answer the question why we are here simply with \"because we walked.\" Because we did, do, will always do, and always have been doing it.

We estimate that OA is able to capture between 85-93% of authors for all disciplines, with the exception of Social Sciences and Humanities, where it only reaches an estimated 47%. The availability of papers in Open Access was calculated to be 41% for the period 1953-2021 and 46% when considering exclusively the post-law period (2014-2021). In both periods, gold Open Access made up the most common route. When comparing equal periods post and pre-law, we observed that the upward trend of gold Open Access was pre-existing to the legislation and the availability of closed articles in repositories increased by 5% to what is estimated based on existing trends. However, while the green route has had a positive evolution, it has been the publication in gold journals that has boosted access to Argentine production more "

Prior to 1914 the USA had completely open borders.  Millions of people poured in from around the world in this time, including likely most of your ancestors.  They did not come with much, and most were unskilled.  But they were willing to work and dug themselves out of poverty.  They allowed businesses to grow, raised the potential GDP, and were able to afford their children more opportunities.  Nowadays, however, when illegals come to the US, even though they essentially are doing the exact same things as our ancestors... we see them as undesirable, while the former we see admirably.\n\nWhy is this?  Well, due to the welfare state we endow citizens with a certain pro-rated piece of the government expenditure that comes out of tax dollars.  Therefore, we can't just let anyone in because that would sap tax dollars.  The *only* way that illegals benefit American society, is if they aren't entitled to that pro-rated piece of the pie.  In other words... if they are illegal.\n\nThe aggregate economic impact of illegal immigration is debatable, but any claim "

        "text": "Context: Reactive programming (RP) is a declarative programming paradigm suitable for expressing the handling of events. It enables programmers to create applications that react automatically to changes over time. Whenever a time-varying signal changes -- e.g. in response to values produced by event stream (e.g., sensor data, user input...) -- the program state is updated automatically in tandem with that change. This makes RP well-suited for building interactive applications and reactive (soft real-time) systems. Inquiry: RP Language implementations are often built on top of an existing (host) language as an Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL). This results in application code in which reactive code and non-reactive code is inherently entangled. Using a mechanism known as lifting, one usually has access to the full feature set of the (non-reactive) host language in the RP program. However, lifting is also dangerous. First, host code expressed in a Turing-complete language may diverge, resulting in unresponsive programs: i.e. reactive programs that are not actually reactive. Second, the bi-directional integration of reactive and non-reactive code results in a paradigmatic mismatch "

However, organic farming does have fewer chemical inputs into the land, which causes less strain on the environment. There are tighter restrictions on pesticides, herbicides, and no synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. This is beneficial to the environment because there is less groundwater pollution from organic crops ([nitrogen runoff is a big problem](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fertilizer-runoff-overwhelms-streams/)). Because organic farmers can't just dump on more nitrogen when the soil is depleted, they are more reliant on using crop rotation, compost, cover crops, etc. \n\nAlso, the limits on pesticide use mean that organic farms aren't in an evolutionary arms race of pesticide vs pest...

At 24 he became secretary of a Liverpool bank; when his health demanded a temporary rest, he was sent with a large salary to a manager's post in Wrexham in 1908. He later sought a complete change and took up agricultural work, then in 1913 went on to be secretary of a housing scheme, the Welsh Planning and Housing Trust.\nAs a Liberal non-conformist, Davies disparaged the National Service League's demand for conscription, and believed the answer was to volunteer militarily, so he took an officer's commission in the Territorial Army with the Royal Welsh Fusiliers while working at Wrexham. By early 1914 he came to realise that military force was incompatible with his deepening Christian devotion, and resigned. At the end of 1914 he became full-time paid Assistant "

The PHP is a passive, wickless thermal device, whereby a two-phase fluid, forming liquid plugs and vapour slugs, moves with a pulsating or circulating motion inside a meandering tube or channel. The PHP may have a very broad range of geometries (flat, tubular, 3D structured), it can dissipate heat from large areas, and it can be suitable for high power applications with low/medium heat fluxes. PHP functioning is based on the capillary effect, which provides the existence of liquid plugs completely filling the channel cross-section, in a way that any expansion or contraction of the vapour slugs will naturally generate a movement of the fluid along the channel axis. For this, it is important that the channel has a cross-section size below a given threshold, which depends on the liquid surface tension and (for a static fluid) on "

It allows applications with high memory demands to use memory in other computer nodes. However, disaggregated memory is not easy to use for implementing data structures in C++ because the C++ standard does not provide an adequate abstraction to use it efficiently in a high-level, modular manner. Because accessing remote memory involves high latency, disaggregated memory is often used as a far-memory system, which forms a kind of swap memory where part of local memory is used as a cache area, while the remaining memory is not subject to swapping. To pursue performance, programmers have to be aware of this nonuniform memory view and place data appropriately to minimize swapping. In this work, we model the address space of memory-disaggregated systems as the far-memory model, present the collective allocator abstraction, which enables us to specify object placement aware of memory address subspaces, and apply it to programming aware of the far-memory model. The far-memory model provides a view of the nonuniform memory "

However, the dimensionless composition law $(u'=u/c,v'=v/c) \\rightarrow (u'+v')/(1+u'v')$ does not contain any longer a perturbation parameter. Nevertheless, this idea brought the birth of the \" deformation theory of algebraic structures\", culminating in the use of the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of Lie algebras and one of the first applications of computer algebra in the seventies. One may also notice that the main idea of general relativity is to deform the Minkowski metric of space-time by means of the small dimensionless parameter $\\phi/c^2$ where $\\phi=GM/r$ is the gravitational potential at a distance r of a central attractive mass M with gravitational constant G.

However, this can be curtailed somewhat by what we define to be our in-group. This can be modified by our ideology, our culture, and any other normative socializing that might happen. The alleged \"cure\" for racism, then, is to work with our tribal psycho-biology and seek to define our in-group to be more inclusive, especially along racial lines.\n\nIf my understanding of this is correct, then I think that this could be self-defeating in terms of a solution.

Quantitative models for conversion of kerogen into oil and gas and the timing of hydrocarbon generation have been well documented. However, lack of consensus about the kinetics of hydrocarbon formation in source rocks, expulsion timing and how the resulting hydrocarbons escape from or are retained in the source rocks motivates further investigation. In particular, many mechanisms for the transport of hydrocarbons from the source rocks in which they are generated into adjacent rocks with higher permeabilities and smaller capillary entry pressures have been proposed, and a better understanding of this complex process (primary migration) is needed. To characterize these processes it is imperative to use the latest technological advances. In this study, it is shown how insights into hydrocarbon migration in source rocks can be obtained by using sequential high resolution synchrotron "

In some languages, the types are unreliable; in others, communication across type boundaries can be extremely expensive; and still others allow only limited forms of interoperability. The research community is actively seeking a sound, fast, and expressive approach to gradual typing. Inquiry: This paper describes Static Python, a language developed by engineers at Instagram that has proven itself sound, fast, and reasonably expressive in production. Static Python's approach to gradual types is essentially a programmer-tunable combination of the concrete and transient approaches from the literature. Concrete types provide full soundness and low performance overhead, but impose nonlocal constraints. Transient types are sound in a shallow sense and easier to use; they help to bridge the gap between untyped code and typed concrete code. Approach: We evaluate the language in its current state and develop a model that captures the essence of its approach to gradual types. We draw upon personal communication, bug reports, and the Static Python regression test suite "

I wasn't sure whether this was the right sub to ask, but I figured that singers who actually exercised their intrinsic core muscle groups would be here. ;-)  \n1. My primary focus would currently be less core strength and more core endurance. Are there any other core exercises that train endurance or is deadbug all the way to go, just holding longer and longer?     \n2. I have become a bit obsessed with breathing the right away while engaging the core. I tried while running this morning and am not sure I actually got it. Do you guys engage your core when doing cardio type exercises, including avoiding accessory breathing?\nstickysweetastytreat: I train with a few choir singers so this is based on that, not first-hand singing experience.\n\n"

Talk of emergency: kids pick up on the emotional/behavioral cues of the parent.

The \"time out\" is not a punishment, but literally a time for the kid to get out of the poor behavior pattern and begin to relax. Discussion happens going into and coming out of time out. The result, when done calmly and consistently, is a kid who learns how to breathe and think through problems, and then talk them through.\n\n"

They allow EDSL authors to define domain-natural notation, which is often different from the host language syntax. Nowadays, there are several research works of powerful user-defined syntax extensions. One promising approach uses user-defined operators. A user-defined operator is a function with user-defined syntax. It can be regarded as a syntax extension implemented without macros. An advantage of user-defined operators is that an operator can be statically typed. The compiler can find type errors in the definition of an operator before the operator is used. In addition, the compiler can resolve syntactic ambiguities by using static types. However, user-defined operators are difficult to implement language constructs involving static name binding. Name binding is association between names and values (or memory locations). Our inquiry is whether we can design a system for user-defined operators involving a new custom name binding.

This is one of the first examples of such a species in a biological system for which M{\\\"o}ssbauer parameters are now available: delta(/Fe) = 0.54 (1) mm/s, DeltaE(Q) = -0.80 (5) mm/s, and the asymmetry parameter eta = 0.60 (5) mm/s. The M{\\\"o}ssbauer and spin Hamiltonian parameters have been evaluated on a model from the side-on peroxo complex (model 2) issued from the oxidized iron center "

Aside from the obvious fact that people see enormous benefit in simply having dogs as companions, dogs also serve as guides for the blind, aids to people with disabilities, can detect seizures and panic attacks before they hit and warn their owners, help screen for toxic and harmful substances (bomb sniffing dogs), can be used to herd and protect livestock, and can even detect cancer and other conditions in humans.

Many people with terminal cancers or disease processes that are incurable with chemotherapy, radiation or other medical modalities, to whom have approximately less than 6 months to live, choose hospice as a way to provide a higher quality of living for the remainder of their lifetime.  *The ultimate goal of hospice is to provide the highest quality of life that is filled with comfort and peace during the final stages of life*.\n \n**Myth**: Hospice means \u2018giving up\u2019 and \u2018choosing death\u2019\n**Fact**: Although the possibility of curing an illness has passed, choosing hospice affirms the idea that *quality of life is far greater than "

My best lift was a Deadlift at a perfect 1:1, 380lbs bodyweight, 380lbs plates.

These rough surfaces play a major role in the dissolution of rocks around stressed contacts, the transport of dissolved material and the precipitation in surrounding pores. Consequently, they play an active role in the evolution of rock microstructures and rheological properties in the Earth's crust. They are observed individually or in networks, in proximity to fractures and joints, and in numerous geological settings. This review article deals with their geometrical and compositional characteristics and the factors leading to their genesis. The main questions this review focuses on are the following: How do they form? How can they be used to measure strain and formation stress? How do they control fluid flow in the upper crust? Geometrically, stylolites have fractal roughness, with fractal geometrical properties exhibiting typically three scaling regimes: a self-affine scaling with Hurst exponent 1.1+/-0.1 at small scale (up to tens or hundreds of microns), another one with Hurst exponent around 0.5 to "

I've seen a lot of bad hardwood floor jobs, and hopefully this will prevent some of those from happening.  The biggest problem I see with DIY hardwood floor finishing, is that people read an article online that says rent a drum sander and buy some poly from Home Depot. There's more to it than that, and if you follow those simplistic instructions, you're gonna end up with a refinished floor, but it's not going to be very nice, and it probably won't last long.\n\nAlso, note that I don't talk about installation in this, only refinishing.  Installation is a whole other article.  If there's interest, I'll post something on that.\n\n=====\nFirst off, do NOT use a drum sander. These things will leave the floor uneven and you'll be able to see it in the reflected light off the floor. A lot of the rentals have been abused and are out of adjustment and can leave gouges or lines in the floor also.  If you've never sanded a floor before, get one of the random orbital floor sanders that have 3 or 4 discs on the bottom. "

Starting with the idea that the universe is considered to be infinite. However it is also considered to be illogical for anything that exists (physically) to be infinite. The universe is also a vaccum, so therefore it is nothingness. Which supports the idea that it can be infinite as it is not physical, "

He adores using the monkey bars we got our kids for Christmas and challenges himself constantly. Sometimes we enforce time off the bars due to his hands being covered in callouses and blisters!! \n\nOne day while having time off the bars he was balancing on a wobble cushion. He got past a minute on each leg. I suggested he try balance on a ball never thinking he'd be able. He hopped on a kid size soccer ball and balanced (both feet) for well over a minute. We were laughing and I was saying it was crazy he could do it so long. For fun, I threw a soft ball at him to set him off balance, but he caught it. So my husband suggested he pass it round his waist while balancing, which he did, no worries. My husband and I are flabbergasted.\n\nHe is loving these fun challenges but I'm a bit stumped. I'm not interested in making him exercise as such, he's only 8 and he plays so hard, the last thing he needs is \"exercises\". But I am looking for resources for interesting and age appropriate challenges I can suggest to him for fun. Any "

Thanks\nsunnyday420: So when light is propagating through a medium of water its going to be observed to travel 30% slower and when it leaves the water it speeds back up. So to calculate light you need to know the medium its propagating through. Which leads to how the medium of space is not an authentic medium, and the distances to the luminaries/stars are actually much closer than the failed calculations say. \n\nThen more importantly they are treating light as a particle AND a sound wave. This is false. There is no particle of light according to nikola tesla, he had an explanation as to why.. the background medium of ether that exists that enables the soundwave of light to propagate through.

It would be so much easier to just have actual rules instead of just guessing and perpetually getting stuck offending people. There are a lot of points but here are my favorites:\n\n1. Do not speak ill of the absent if it can be avoided. The day may come when some friend will need to defend you in your absence. (honestly this has helped me so much in work meetings, just asking myself what I would say if the person were here) \n2. When a newcomer enters a group, wait for him to be introduced or, if you are acquainted with him, introduce him. Show the courtesy, when another person joins the group or when you are relating an incident, or recapping what has been said for the benefit of the newcomer.

The self is what you are born as where the persona is how you portray yourself to society. The persona is what you develop in order to better relate to society. It contains all of the positive traits that are socialized into you and reinforced where it casts away traits that society doesn't like. You can look at the persona as a tree that casts a larger shadow the taller that it grows. The shadow is a part of your personality that ends up neglected and unused where it slowly corrodes your character and splits your personality. Jung thought that the best way to be a \"complete\" personality was to integrate the shadow with the persona, which is essentially finding ways to funnel and vent the shadow's tendencies into your persona so that you stop being a face and start being a personality. \n\nThe simplest application of this is learning to integrate aggression into your personality. As you might imagine, just beating people up or being physically abusive isn't a popular trait in society though "

This led to the definition of Ma{\\~n}{\\'e} genericity: a property is generic if, given a Hamiltonian H, the set of potentials u such that H + u satisfies the property is generic. This notion is mostly used in the context of Hamiltonians which are convex in p, in the sense that $\\partial$ 2 pp H is positive definite at each points. We will also restrict our study to this situation. There is a close relation between perturbations of Hamiltonians by a small additive potential and perturbations by a positive factor close to one. Indeed, the Hamiltonians H + u and H/(1 -- u) have the same level one energy surface, hence their dynamics on this energy surface are reparametrisation of each other, this is the Maupertuis principle. This remark is particularly relevant when H is homogeneous in the fibers (which corresponds to Finsler metrics) or even fiberwise quadratic (which corresponds to Riemannian metrics).

Inquiry: In the last three decades, several language design proposals have been introduced to reduce the complexity that emerges from describing said interaction and coordination of actors. We argue that none of these proposals is satisfactory in order to express the many complex interaction patterns between actors found in modern reactive distributed systems.

A number of neutrino experiments in the last three decades have observed anomalous oscillation signals consistent with a mass-squared splitting of $\\Delta m^2 \\sim 1\\ \\textrm{eV}^2$, motivating the existence and search for sterile neutrinos. On the other hand, other experiments have failed to see such a signal. In this thesis, we present two analyses.

We find that the 3+1 model provides a better fit to the global data set compared to the null, with an improvement of $\\Delta \\chi^2 = 51$ with the addition of only 3 degrees of freedom, corresponding to $6.6\\sigma$. While a substantial improvement, we also find a irreconcilable tension between the data sets of $5.1\\sigma$, calculated using the parameter goodness-of-fit test.

Never too hot or too long.  /u/dizzley would add that you should try a range of moisturizers until you find one to suit. People's needs differ. I use a product called Aveeno and my second choice is Aqueous Cream as it's called in the UK.  /u/kikistiel Would like to add to number 2, before you put moisturizer on gently pat a toner on as well. People always forget the toner step but it\u2019s so important! Imagine rubbing lotion on an dry sponge (no toner) vs a wet sponge (toner). It absorbs into the skin so much better and really makes a difference. You can get toners super cheap and I swear it\u2019s like night and day :)\n3. If your skin often feels irritated, try buying softer clothing "

They feel like the other person doesn\u2019t actually want to talk to them, and yes, it\u2019s true, they probably don\u2019t wanna talk to you.

If you\u2019re all serious and sad and trying to let everyone know you\u2019re depressed, nobody will want to associate with you. They might be nice to you, but that\u2019s only because they feel bad. They look at you as some little sad creature that needs a hug, not a friend. Even if you feel like you\u2019re dying inside, you need to act happy and smile. acting depressed around other people is NOT attractive if you want to find a significant other or just a friend. Crack jokes, smile, laugh, tease, use light sarcasm, accept any flaws you have and don\u2019t be defensive are just some things you can do.

In order to become a member, all existing states need to accept Catalonia unanimously.

We investigate, here, the formation of CH+ in turbulent and multiphase environments, where the heating of the gas is almost solely driven by the photoelectric effect. Methods: The diffuse ISM is simulated using the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code RAMSES which self-consistently computes the dynamical and thermal evolution of the gas along with the time-dependent evolutions of the abundances of H$^+$, H, and H$_2$. The rest of the chemistry, including the abundance of CH$^+$, is computed in post-processing, at equilibrium, under the constraint of out-ofequilibrium of H$^+$, H, and H$_2$. The comparison with the observations is performed taking into account an often neglected, yet paramount, piece of information, namely the length of the intercepted diffuse matter along the observed lines of sight. Results: The quasi totality of the mass of CH$^+$ originates from the unstable gas, in environments where the kinetic temperature is larger than 600 K, the density ranges between 0.6 and 10 cm$^{-3}$, the electronic "

The move in date was the following month.

Long story short, she never returned it.\n\nHere are some things I have learned the costly way:\n\n1. If you can only afford to rent a room, avoid apartments. Most of the time, the tenants are subletting illegally. If they get caught, all of you can get evicted. Check with the landlord first. Don't just take the tenant's word for it. Renting a room in a house from the verified owner is a safer option. (Plus, if you ever have to sue the owner, and you win, you can put a lien on her real estate if she refuses to pay you.)\n\n2.

Secondly, the idea that 'Nature' or what is 'natural' has to do with what's tangible or harmonious is just besides the point.

Other people seem to age at a normal rate, the day seems as long as it was before, tasks seems to take as long as they ever did.

They are faking not being injured\nWhy YSK: I see so many videos on Reddit of cats limping, then suddenly walking normally when they get close to their human. The OP, and the commenters find it hilarious, and make jokes about the cat faking injury for sympathy.\n\nCats (and many other animals) will **instinctively hide their injuries** so as not to seem vulnerable to potential predators or rivals. If your cat is limping then suddenly stops, dont post a cute video on the net laughing about it. **Take them to a vet.**\n\nWalking on an injured leg is not only painful but could worsen or prolong the injury.\n\nIf you are going to own a pet and be responsible for its life and wellbeing, educate yourself about its natural behaviours and how to care for it properly. Anthropomorphising your pet by lazily projecting human behaviours (such as faking an injury for sympathy) on to it, is not a substitute for doing some basic research on how to care for the creature who is dependant on you.\nEdgarAllanRoevWade: God you sound so fucking high and mighty.

Indeed, on page 78/79 of this book, Macaulay is saying the following: \" A polynomial ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\subset k[{\\chi}\\_1$,..., ${\\chi}\\_n]=k[\\chi]$ is of the {\\it principal class} and thus {\\it unmixed} if it has rank $r$ and is generated by $r$ polynomials. Having in mind this definition, a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ with associated prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = rad(\\mathfrak{q})$ is such that any ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\\mathfrak{a} \\subset \\mathfrak{q}$ determines a primary ideal of greater {\\it multiplicity} over $k$. In particular, we have $dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/({\\chi}\\_1$,...,${\\chi}\\_n)^2)=n+1$ because, passing to a system of PD equations for one unknown $y$, the parametric jets are \\{${y,y\\_1, ...,y\\_n}$\\} but any ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\\mathfrak{a}\\subset ({\\chi}\\_1,{\\^a},{\\chi}\\_n)^2$ is contained into a {\\it simple} ideal, that is a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ such that $rad(\\mathfrak{q})=\\mathfrak{m}\\in max(k[\\chi])$ "

Also, 12 x 18 can be broken into 12(10 + 8). 120 + 96 = 216. Find what numbers work best.\n* If multiplying a two digit number by 11, add the two numbers together and put it in the middle. 11 x 53 can be simplified as 5 + 3 = 8, put the 8 in the middle, so 11 x 53 = 583. 11 x 27 = 297 since 2 + 7 = 9, and the 9 goes in the middle.

Unit tests and functional tests do not suffice because of race conditions that are not discovered by those tests. This problem is addressed by model checking tools. A simple model checker is useful for detecting race conditions prior to production. Inquiry: Current model checkers hardwire the behavior of common thread operations, and do not recognize application-dependent thread paradigms or functions using simpler primitive operations. This introduces additional operations, causing current model checkers to be excessively slow. In addition, there is no mechanism to model the semantics of the actual thread wakeup policies implemented in the underlying thread library or operating system. Eliminating these constraints can make model checkers faster. Approach: McMini is an **extensible** model checker based on DPOR (Dynamic Partial Order Reduction). A mechanism was invented to declare to McMini new, primitive thread operations, typically in 100~lines or less of C~code.

You want to help stop sweat shops? Stop consuming so much. Keep wearing your clothes until you wear them out. Buy secondhand as much as possible. I'm the least fashionable person in my workplace but my coworkers still admit to knowing me and still invite me out to drinks after work. I used to shop and dress up as a hobby and now I garden. There are plenty of activities you can do that don't cost as much (in terms of money, social impacts, and environmental impacts) and there are people who will like you despite your clothes. \n\nTl;dr the way to shop ethically is to shop as little as possible.\nOedium: Do you donate the money you would've spent on clothes to those in absolute poverty?

It focuses on a Korteweg-de Vries equation, which is a nonlinear mathematical model of waves on shallow water surfaces. Two different types of saturated controls are considered. The well-posedness is proven applying a Banach fixed point theorem, using some estimates of this equation and some properties of the saturation function. The proof of the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is separated in two cases: i) when the control acts on all the domain, a Lyapunov function together with a sector condition describing the saturating input is used to conclude on the stability, ii) when the control is localized, we argue by contradiction. Some numerical simulations illustrate the stability of the closed-loop nonlinear partial differential equation. 1. Introduction. In recent decades, a great effort has been made to take into account input saturations in control designs (see e.g [39], [15] or more recently [17]). In most applications, actuators are limited due to some physical constraints and the control input has to be bounded. Neglecting the amplitude actuator limitation "

        "text": "The symmetry algebras of certain families of quantum spin chains are considered in detail. The simplest examples possess m states per site (m\\geq2), with nearest-neighbor interactions with U(m) symmetry, under which the sites transform alternately along the chain in the fundamental m and its conjugate representation \\bar{m}. We find that these spin chains, even with {\\em arbitrary} coefficients of these interactions, have a symmetry algebra A_m much larger than U(m), which implies that the energy eigenstates fall into sectors that for open chains (i.e., free boundary conditions) can be labeled by j=0, 1, >..., L, for the 2L-site chain, such that the degeneracies of all eigenvalues in the jth sector are generically the same and increase rapidly with j. For large j, these degeneracies are much larger than those that would be expected from the U(m) symmetry alone. The enlarged symmetry algebra A_m(2L) consists of operators that commute in this space of states with the Temperley-Lieb algebra that is generated by the set of nearest-neighbor interaction terms; A_m(2L) is not a Yangian. There are similar results for supersymmetric chains with gl(m+n|n) symmetry of nearest-neighbor interactions, "

        "text": "A central question in routing games has been to establish conditions for the uniqueness of the equilibrium, either in terms of network topology or in terms of costs. This question is well understood in two classes of routing games. The first is the non-atomic routing introduced by Wardrop on 1952 in the context of road traffic in which each player (car) is infinitesimally small; a single car has a negligible impact on the congestion. Each car wishes to minimize its expected delay. Under arbitrary topology, such games are known to have a convex potential and thus a unique equilibrium. The second framework is splitable atomic games: there are finitely many players, each controlling the route of a population of individuals (let them be cars in road traffic or packets in the communication networks). In this paper, we study two other frameworks of routing games in which each of several players has an integer number of connections (which are population of packets) to route and where there is a constraint that a connection cannot be split. Through a particular game with a simple three link topology, we identify various novel and surprising properties of games within these frameworks. We show "

Serendipitous X-ray surveys have proven to be an efficient way to find rare objects, for example tidal disruption events, changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGN), binary quasars, ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), and intermediate mass black holes. With the advent of very large X-ray surveys, an automated classification of X-ray sources becomes increasingly valuable.Aims. This work proposes a revisited naive Bayes classification of the X-ray sources in the Swift-XRT and XMM-Newton catalogs into four classes -- AGN, stars, X-ray binaries (XRBs) and cataclysmic variables (CVs) -- based on their spatial, spectral and timing properties and their multiwavelength counterparts. An outlier measure is used to identify objects of other natures. The classifier is optimized to maximize the classification performance of a chosen class (here XRBs) and it is adapted to data mining purposes.Methods. We augmented the X-ray catalogs with multiwavelength data, source class, and variability properties. We then built a reference sample of about 25000 X-ray sources of known nature.

Today I tried splitting them up into sets of 8-10 from the get go to not wear my grip out too much at the start, but the same issue still occurred where after about 9 and a half minutes my forearms were so pumped I couldn't even hold on to the bar with one arm. It always happens very suddenly as well, up to 95 my arms feel completely fine and then when I try and hang after my last set my hand literally feels as though it's about to rip off the bar. I tend to randomly alternate between chin-ups and pull-ups because chin-ups are harder on the grip but easier to perform reps, but pull-ups are much harder to engage my scapula "

        "text": "The interplay between viscoelasticity and inertia in dilute polymer solutions at high deformation rates can result in inertio-elastic instabilities. The nonlinear evolution of these instabilities generates a state of turbulence with significantly different spatio-temporal features compared to Newtonian turbulence, termed elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT). We explore EIT by studying the dynamics of a submerged planar jet of a dilute aqueous polymer solution injected into a quiescent tank of water using a combination of schlieren imaging and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). We show how fluid elasticity has a nonmonotonic effect on the jet stability depending on its magnitude, creating two distinct regimes in which elastic effects can either destabilize or stabilize the jet. In agreement with linear stability analyses of viscoelastic jets, an inertio-elastic shear-layer instability emerges near the edge of the jet for small levels of elasticity, independent of bulk undulations in the fluid column. The growth of this disturbance mode destabilizes the flow, resulting in a turbulence transition at lower Reynolds numbers and closer to the nozzle compared to the conditions required for the transition "

We characterize the long-term variability of AT 2000ch in the radio and optical regimes with archival data reaching back to the year 1984. We use these newly reduced observations in addition to observations in the literature to restrict the mass-loss rates of AT 2000ch at multiple epochs based on different approaches, and to infer the general properties of its circumstellar nebula with respect to the detected radio brightness. We extend the known optical light curve of AT 2000ch up to the beginning of 2022 by performing point spread function photometry on archival data from the Palomar Transient Factory and the Zwicky Transient Facility.

This is so because there are general and definite rules for the change of subjective probabilities through information or experience; induction and belief change are one and same topic, after all. The most basic of these rules is simply to conditionalize with respect to the information received; and there are similar and more general rules. 1 Hence, a fundamental reason for the epistemological success of probability theory is that there at all exists a well-behaved concept of conditional probability. Still, people have, and have reasons for, various concerns over probability theory. One of these is my starting point: Intuitively, we have the notion of plain belief; we believe propositions2 to be true (or to be false or neither). Probability theory, however, offers no formal counterpart to this notion. Believing A is not the same as having probability 1 for A, because probability 1 is incorrigible3; but plain belief is clearly corrigible.

It is often written as the 1st century AD or 1st century CE to distinguish it from the 1st century BC (or BCE) which preceded it. The 1st century is considered part of the Classical era, epoch, or historical period. The Roman Empire, Han China and the Parthian Persia were the most powerful and hegemonic states.\nDuring this century, the Roman Empire (ruled by the Julio-Claudian and Flavian dynasties) continued to be in a period of relative stability known as Pax Romana, notwithstanding a financial crisis in 33 and a civil war in 69. In Europe, Rome expanded into Britain and fought wars in Germania and Dacia. In Africa, Rome was challenged by Tacfarinas, who led his own Musulamii tribe and a loose and changing coalition of other Berber tribes before being defeated in 24. In West Asia, Rome defeated a Jewish rebellion (66\u201373) and fought a war with Parthia from 58\u201363, though the latter conflict was inconclusive. In East Asia, the Chinese Western Han dynasty was overthrown and replaced by the Xin dynasty in 9, which in turn faced its own rebel movements "

However, I see there is a general consensus that barbell exercises are much better for the lower body. Having known that, I was thinking if there was a way in which I can incorporate sandbags into my leg workout. I've taken a look at the Bulgarian sandbag, but the fact that most of them weigh up to 50 pounds with no way to add weight on makes it seem less viable in my opinion. Also, for deadlifts, I've looked at some VERY cheap sand at [Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.ca/product/king-construction-sand-30kg/902210) which seems amazing, but ~67 LBS still seems pretty low for a beginner trying to progress as fast as possible during the \"noob gainz\" phase. It may be great for starting, but where do I go from there to progress? Do you guys have any creative ideas to maybe load two of the sand bags in one? What type of bag can hold 100+ LBS of sand? Are there any other substitutes for barbells for deadlifts and squats that are cheap?\n\n**TL;DR: Any way to increase weight for sandbags for deadlifts and squats?**\n"

We had previously studied an ionic metal-polymer composites (IPMC), which consists in an ionic polymer film such as Nafion saturated with water and coated on both sides with a thin layer of metal acting as electrodes. This system bends when it is subject to an electric field orthogonal to the film and can thus be used as an actuator. Conversely, the deflection of the film generates a potential difference between the electrodes ; the same system can therefore be used as a sensor.We have developed a ''continuous medium'' model for this system. The thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes had enabled us to establish its constitutive equations.We are currently interested in a system of close properties based on PEDOT, a semiconductor EAP. The central part of the device consists in two interpenetrating polymers playing the role of an ions reservoir.

Specifically, we study one-parameter families $(M^4,\\omega,F_t=(J,H_t))_{0 \\leq t \\leq 1}$ of systems with a fixed Hamiltonian $S^1$-space $(M,\\omega,J)$ and which are semitoric for certain values of the parameter $t$, with a focus on such families in which one singular point undergoes a Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcation (also called nodal trade in the context of semitoric systems, and more generally almost toric fibrations). Beyond semitoric systems, we also study families containing hypersemitoric systems, and we investigate the local theory of a nodal trade. Building on and generalizing the ideas of a previous paper, we show how such families can be used to find explicit semitoric systems with certain desired invariants (bundled in the marked semitoric polygon). This allows us to make progress on the semitoric minimal model program by understanding and coming up with explicit systems for each strictly minimal type (i.e. those not admitting any toric or semitoric type blowdown). In order to obtain these systems, we develop strategies for constructing and understanding explicit "

The primary goal is that someone answers and engages with whatever scam they're running i.e IRS, car warranty, Amazon purchase or whatever. \n\nHowever, the system also tracks anytime someone declines the call because that means it is a legitimate person's cell phone number as opposed to an out-of-service number or an office line. By declining, your number ends up in a database for future calls that can be more targeted or persistent. \n\nThe robo-caller groups frequently use this as a secondary revenue stream by selling the list of confirmed numbers to more sophisticated scammers. This also applies to \"replying STOP\" to scam text messages. \n\nBy ignoring it altogether, you don't provide the system any information and they're less likely to try your number again in the future.\n\nTL;DR Just let calls from unknown numbers ring instead of declining and just delete spam text messages.

Prior to 1914 the USA had completely open borders.  Millions of people poured in from around the world in this time, including likely most of your ancestors.  They did not come with much, and most were unskilled.  But they were willing to work and dug themselves out of poverty.  They allowed businesses to grow, raised the potential GDP, and were able to afford their children more opportunities.  Nowadays, however, when illegals come to the US, even though they essentially are doing the exact same things as our ancestors... we see them as undesirable, while the former we see admirably.\n\nWhy is this?  Well, due to the welfare state we endow citizens with a certain pro-rated piece of the government expenditure that comes out of tax dollars.  Therefore, we can't just let anyone in because that would sap tax dollars.  The *only* way that illegals benefit American society, is if they aren't entitled to that pro-rated piece of the pie.

The sets looked like 8-8-7-7-6 and 8 is the most reps I can do in a set so I was pushing myself pretty hard. This is the first time I tried arch body technique which I think is why the injury happened. Before I had been doing only hollow body pull ups which is more beginner friendly. Hollow body pull ups use more of your lats. Arch body puts more work on your upper back than the lats, which are way bigger so they can take more stress. Anyways, the injury actually occured in my next exercise which was chin ups. It's not because I did pull ups and followed that with chin ups, I have done that many times before with no problems and I used only hollow body technique.

Streams are getting popular among Java developers as they leverage the conciseness of functional programming and ease the parallelization of data processing. Despite the benefits of streams, in comparison to data processing relying on imperative code, streams can introduce significant overheads which are mainly caused by extra object allocations and reclamations, and the use of virtual method calls. As a result, developers need means to study the runtime behavior of streams in the goal of both mitigating such abstraction overheads and optimizing stream processing.

How that changes is how you both get along. \n\nIf you could see somehow that the people aren't potential friends or forces of judgement, and instead understanding individuals who want to work together and get to know and understand you, maybe some of the anxiety may fade. I'm not friends with all of my coworkers, but they're not enemies either. In fact, a good deal of them are socially anxious as well. I could very easily see those individuals just hanging out "

If the results of your actions are constantly used as a barometer for your confidence, you'll live in a state of perpetual self doubt. \n\n\nIn reality, **you already have confidence.** You use it every day.

Modern Erie Railroad station signage denoted the station as \"Home of Alliance College,\" a local private university that closed in 1987.\nService to Cambridge Springs began in October 1862, with completion of the Atlantic and Great Western Railway to Meadville, a 6 ft (1,829 mm) railway that originally went from Salamanca to Corry, Pennsylvania, until work was suspended in 1861 due to financial issues. The Atlantic and Great Western would later be completed in June 1864, with connection to "

The genesis of this conflict rests in two agreements in 1892 and 1924 between the Madras Presidency and Kingdom of Mysore. The 802 kilometres (498 mi) Kaveri river has 44,000 km2 basin area in Tamil Nadu and 32,000 km2 basin area in Karnataka.  The annual inflow from Karnataka is 425 TMCft (12 km3) whereas that from Tamil Nadu is 252 TMCft  (7.1 km3).\nBased on the inflow Karnataka is demanding its due share of water from the river. It states that the pre-independence agreements are invalid and are angled heavily in the favour of the Madras Presidency, and has demanded a renegotiated settlement based on \"equitable sharing of the waters\". Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, says that it has already developed almost 3,000,000 acres (12,000 km2) of land and as a result has come to depend very heavily on the existing pattern of usage. Any change in this pattern, it says, will adversely affect the livelihood of millions of farmers in the state.

        "text": "In the paradigm of choreographic programming, the overall behaviour of a distributed system is coded as a choreography from a global viewpoint. The choreography can then be automatically projected (compiled) to a correct implementation for each participant. This paradigm is interesting because it relieves the programmer from manually writing the separate send and receive actions performed by participants, which simplifies development and avoids communication mismatches. However, the applicability of choreographic programming in the real world remains largely unexplored. The reason is twofold. First, while there have been several proposals of choreographic programming languages, none of these languages have been used to implement a realistic, widely-used protocol. Thus there is a lack of experience on how realistic choreographic programs are structured and on the relevance of the different features explored in theoretical models. Second, applications of choreographic programming shown so far are intrusive, in the sense that each participant must use exactly the code projected from the choreography. This prevents using the code generated from choreographies with existing third-party implementations "

It's the old sugar-on-the-tongue trick.\n\nThe feeling of a burned tongue or mouth is one of those pains that is just so subtly annoying that it drove me NUTS. Next time you're way too eager for a hot cookie and obliterate your mouth with its delicious, piping hot gooeyness, be sure to cure it with sugar. \n\nThis trick works every time for me-- I'm fairly certain it has something to do with the enzyme amylase, which digests sugars in your mouth. It cures a burn almost immediately, allowing you to go about your day as if you had never taken that regrettable bite/ sip of the regrettably hot snack.\n\nOnce you burn your tongue, or any other part of your mouth, open your mouth so that it can have some access to air. \n\n-Coat the area of your burn with sugar (brown or white). Be extremely generous with the sugar. \n\n-Keep your mouth open/ tongue out, because this ensures that the sugar stays put and doesn't get swallowed. \n\nAfter about a minute, or longer if you wish, you're pretty much good to go.

It differs from existing freely-available software mainly in that the scattering matrices used to describe the receiver and its components are analytic rather than numeric. This allows different types of modeling and analysis of receivers to be performed. Non-ideal behavior of receiver components can be parameterized in their scattering matrices. SNS enables the instrument designer to then derive analytic expressions for the signal and noise at the receiver outputs in terms of parameterized component imperfections, and predict their contribution to receiver systematic errors precisely. This can drive the receiver design process by, for instance, allowing the instrument designer to identify which component imperfections contribute most to receiver systematic errors, and hence place firm specifications on individual components.

This article takes as a support of study the stress and magnetization couple ($\\sigma$, m) involved in the phenomena of magnetoelastic coupling in a cubic symmetry medium. Several studies indeed show a non-monotonic sensitivity of the magnetic susceptibility and magnetostriction of certain soft magnetic materials under stress. Modeling such a phenomenon requires the introduction of a second order stress term in the Gibbs free energy density.

We follow the PhD student Mona on her adventure of proving properties about Haskell programs in the proof assistant Coq. On the one hand, as a PhD student in computer science Mona observes an increasing demand for correct software products. In particular, because of the large amount of existing software, verifying existing software products becomes more important. Verifying programs in the functional programming language Haskell is no exception. On the other hand, Mona is delighted to see that communities in the area of theorem proving are becoming popular. Thus, Mona sets out to learn more about the interactive theorem prover Coq and verifying Haskell programs in Coq. To prove properties about a Haskell function in Coq, Mona has to translate the function into Coq code. As Coq programs have to be total and Haskell programs are often not, Mona has to model partiality explicitly in Coq. In her quest for a solution Mona finds an ancient manuscript that explains how properties about Haskell functions can be proven in the proof assistant Agda by translating "

A prominent St. John's businessman, Alderdice was appointed to the Legislative Council of Newfoundland (the Upper House of the legislature) in 1924 and became leader of the Liberal-Conservative Progressive Party and the dominion's Prime Minister when his cousin Walter Stanley Monroe retired from the post on August 15, 1928. Alderdice's first term as prime minister was short-lived, however, as his government lost that year's general election to the Liberals led by Sir Richard Squires.\nAlderdice joined with Liberals dissatisfied with Squires to form the United Newfoundland Party with himself as leader. The Great Depression embroiled the dominion in a severe economic crisis which was compounded by corruption in the Squires government taking the dominion to the brink of bankruptcy.

There is now a good number of open source and proprietary clone detectors for programs written in traditional programming languages. However, the increasing adoption of deep learning models in software poses a challenge to these tools: these models implement functions that are inscrutable black boxes. As more software includes these DNN functions, new techniques are needed in order to assess the similarity between deep learning components of software. Previous work has unveiled techniques for comparing the representations learned at various layers of deep neural network models by feeding canonical inputs to the models. Our goal is to be able to compare DNN functions when canonical inputs are not available -- because they may not be in many application scenarios. The challenge, then, is to generate appropriate inputs and to identify a metric that, for those inputs, is capable of representing the degree of functional similarity between two comparable DNN functions.

These theories primarily address the needs of expert systems, using knowledge structures which must be pre-compiled and remain static in structure during runtime. Many Al systems require the ability to dynamically add and remove parts of the current knowledge structure (e.g., in order to examine what the world would be like for different causal theories). This requires more flexibility than existing uncertainty systems display. In addition, many Al researchers are only interested in using \"probabilities\" as a means of obtaining an ordering, rather than attempting to derive an accurate probabilistic account of a situation. This indicates the need for systems which stress ease of use and don't require extensive probability information when one cannot (or doesn't wish to) provide such information.

They deduce it from the way you act and carry yourself around them.

Its symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache and a fever that can last for a couple of days.\nFor those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis. \n\n#**How does it spread**\n\nTransmission between humans happens when someone comes into contact with an infected person's secretions, such as droplets in a cough.\nDepending on how virulent the virus is, a cough, sneeze or handshake could cause exposure. The virus can also be transmitted by coming into contact with something an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes. Caregivers can sometimes be exposed by handling a patient's waste, according to the CDC.\nThe virus appears to mainly spread from person to person.\n\"People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest),\" "

They have been used in very different domains such as computer science, biology, sociology, management, etc. Authors have been trying to characterize them using various measures such as degree distribution, transitivity or average distance. Their goal is to detect certain properties such as the small-world or scale-free properties. Previous works have shown some of these properties are present in many different systems, while others are characteristic of certain types of systems only. However, each one of these studies generally focuses on a very small number of topological measures and networks. In this work, we aim at using a more systematic approach. We first constitute a dataset of 152 publicly available networks, spanning over 7 different domains. We then process 14 different topological measures to characterize them in the most possible complete way. Finally, we apply standard data mining tools to analyze these data.

There's an important point to understand about engines: they are optimized for a fixed rotation speed. Optimally around 2000 - 3000 rpm.\nWhen the engine is accelerating, the speed is changing, and its fuel usage is not optimized. So, try to keep the engine speed as constant as possible, and this means driving in a *cool* mood.\n\n    EDIT: The optimal RPM is dependent on the car model, and can be as low as 1500, and it's a range, not a specific number. Test with your car and see where you get the most acceleration.\n\n2. 2nd point is braking is what wastes your energy. Look 2 cars ahead of you when you're driving. If you know you'll need to brake soon, do not push the gas pedal. Keep an able safety distance.\n\n3. Opening the windows and having extra attachments to the car increases air drag and wastes energy. If not required, keep the windows shut, especially on the high way. Using the air conditioner on the highway is more efficient.\n\n"

Research endeavours involving WBAN are directed towards effective transmission of detected parameters to a Local Processing Unit (LPU, usually a mobile device) and analysis of the parameters at the LPU or a back-end cloud. An important concern in WBAN is the lightweight nature of WBAN nodes and the need to conserve their energy. This is especially true for subcutaneously implanted nodes that cannot be recharged or regularly replaced. Work in energy conservation is mostly aimed at optimising the routing of signals to minimise energy expended. In this paper, a simple yet innovative approach to energy conservation and detection of alarming health status is proposed. Energy conservation is ensured through a two-tier approach wherein the first tier eliminates `uninteresting' health parameter readings at the site of a sensing node and prevents these from being transmitted across the WBAN to the LPU. A reading is categorised as uninteresting if it deviates very slightly from its immediately preceding "

I've seen a lot of bad hardwood floor jobs, and hopefully this will prevent some of those from happening.  The biggest problem I see with DIY hardwood floor finishing, is that people read an article online that says rent a drum sander and buy some poly from Home Depot. There's more to it than that, and if you follow those simplistic instructions, you're gonna end up with a refinished floor, but it's not going to be very nice, and it probably won't last long.\n\nAlso, note that I don't talk about installation in this, only refinishing.  Installation is a whole other article.  If there's interest, I'll post something on that.\n\n=====\nFirst off, do NOT use a drum sander. These things will leave the floor uneven and you'll be able to see it in the reflected light off the floor. A lot of the rentals have been abused and are out of adjustment and can leave gouges or lines in the floor also.  If you've never sanded a floor before, get one of the random orbital floor sanders that have 3 or 4 discs on the bottom. "

Twenty years ago, our attention turned towards specific DNA structures such as the G-quadruplex (a structure formed by guanine-rich strands). Mass spectrometry allows to discern which molecules interact with one another by measuring the masses of the complexes, and quantity the affinities by measuring their abundance. The most important findings came from unexpected masses. For example, we showed the formation of higher- or lower-order structures by G-quadruplexes used in traditional biophysical assays. We can also derive complete thermodynamic and kinetic description of G-quadruplex folding pathways by measuring cation binding, one at a time.

If the victim decides that they want to give the child up for adoption, they must first receive written permission from the rapist. This means that they must go to their own rapist, request for the child to be put up to adoption, and have them sign a form. I cannot even imagine the psychological turmoil that this would have on the victim. There have been cases where the victim wants to give the child to adoption, but the rapists will only agree to consent if the victim does not testify against the rapist.

Using the mathematical theory of measurement and the physical theory of dimensional analysis, this book provides a coherent theory of value based on an equivalence relation not at the level of exchange, but of production. Indeed exchange is considered here as an equivalence relation between money and a monetary price, and not between commodities, modern monetary theory having demonstrated that money is not a commodity.

Basically, this whole article seems to take a position that ancient people weren't particularly different from children, and therefore, gods couldn't just be metaphorical, no they had to be based on reality. \n\nNot to mention that the examples he's citing of gods abandoning people don't take place in the time span in which he claims gods were abandoning people. He's also not considering religions in which there aren't gods so much as there's a general spirituality. How does animism or totemism fit into a view like this? What about Mahayana Buddhism? Yoruba religion and African conceptions of ubuntu and the role of ancestors? It's an incredibly western-biased piece "

Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of multivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular, the diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite naturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum Parsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the analyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve the major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their discretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an unsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction How do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform themselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to present-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout the Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between these, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract some digestible information from the complexity of these systems. "
