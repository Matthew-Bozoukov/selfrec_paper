There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been observed before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as SN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still unclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the existence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with superwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN progenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on the nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments, in particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain metallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn, SNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives.

As a result, we show that optimizing the memory size carries at most a small cost in terms of time, in the context of Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). That is, we present algorithms that are both time and space efficient for both constructing an MST and for verifying it.This involves several parts that may be considered contributions in themselves.First, we generalize the notion of local proofs, trading off the time complexity for memory efficiency. This adds a dimension to the study of distributed local proofs, which has been gaining attention recently. Specifically, we design a (self-stabilizing) proof labeling scheme which is memory optimal (i.e., $O(\\log n)$ bits per node), and whose time complexity is $O(\\log ^2 n)$ in synchronous networks, or $O(\\Delta \\log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of nodes.

Our aim is to build a model capable of incorporating both data interpolation and inequality constraints into a Gaussian process emulator. By using a functional decomposition, we propose to approximate the original Gaussian process by a finite-dimensional Gaussian process such that all conditional simulations satisfy the inequality constraints in the whole domain. The mean, mode (maximum a posteriori) and prediction intervals (uncertainty quantification) of the conditional Gaussian process are calculated. To investigate the performance of the proposed model, some conditional simulations with inequality constraints such as boundary, monotonicity or convexity conditions are given. 1. Introduction.

By doing chest compressions, you are pressing on the heart (which is basically a one-way valve), simulating a pump, and forcing precious blood to the brain.\n\nA set of 30 chest compressions are recommended between breaths, but it takes about 15 just to get the blood circulating again.  It's not uncommon for a patient to go into cardiac arrest, fall unconscious from lack of oxygen, be given CPR, and become conscious again--only to lose consciousness once more when the CPR stops.\n\nThe whole point is to keep the brain alive until someone arrives with a defibrillator.  *That* is designed to get the heart beating normally again.\n\nSo if you ever find yourself desperately trying to give someone CPR because you saw it done on TV, don't do any of that crap like "

Spectral lines from atoms and molecules in primordial perturbations at high redshifts can give information about the conditions in the early universe before and during the formation of the first stars in addition to the epoch of reionisation. The lines may arise from moving primordial perturbations before the formation of the first stars (resonant scattering lines), or could be thermal absorption or emission lines at lower redshifts. The difficulties in these searches are that the source redshift and evolutionary state, as well as molecular species and transition are unknown, which implies that an observed line can fall within a wide range of frequencies. The lines are also expected to be very weak. Observations from space have the advantages of stability and the lack of atmospheric features which is important in such observations.

According to its proponents, accused witches were actually followers of this alleged religion. They argue that the supposed 'witch cult' revolved around worshiping a Horned God of fertility and the underworld, whose Christian persecutors identified with the Devil, and whose followers held nocturnal rites at the witches' Sabbath.\nThe theory was pioneered by two German scholars, Karl Ernst Jarcke and Franz Josef Mone, in the early nineteenth century, and was adopted by French historian Jules Michelet, American feminist Matilda Joslyn Gage, and American folklorist Charles Leland later that century. The hypothesis received its most prominent exposition when it was adopted by a British Egyptologist, Margaret Murray, who presented her version of it in The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (1921), before further expounding it in books such as The God of the Witches (1931) and her contribution to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Fast recompilation enables cheap experimentation with changes to a project, as those changes can be tested quickly. Separate and incremental compilation has been a topic of interest for a long time to facilitate fast recompilation. Inquiry: Despite the benefits of an incremental compiler, such compilers are usually not the default. This is because incrementalization requires cross-cutting, complicated, and error-prone techniques such as dependency tracking, caching, cache invalidation, and change detection. Especially in compilers for languages with cross-module definitions and integration, correctly and efficiently implementing an incremental compiler can be a challenge. Retrofitting incrementality into a compiler is even harder. We address this problem by developing a compiler design approach that reuses parts of an existing non-incremental compiler to lower the cost of building an incremental compiler. It also gives an intuition into compiling difficult-to-incrementalize language features through staging. Approach: We use the compiler design approach presented in this paper to develop an incremental "

Then measurements of relative humidity within the material are carried out, after searching the OED, which is based on the computation of the sensitivity functions and a priori values of the unknown parameters employed in the mathematical model. The OED enables to plan the experimental conditions in terms of sensor positioning and boundary conditions out of 20 possible designs, ensuring the best accuracy for the identification method and, thus, for the estimated parameter. Two experimental procedures were identified: i) single step of relative humidity from 10% to 75% and ii) multiple steps of relative humidity 10-75-33-75% with an 8-day duration period for each step. For both experiment designs, it has been shown that the sensor has to be placed near the impermeable boundary.

I study the kinematics of clumpy galaxies at z~0.6, and compare their properties with those of counterparts at higher and lower redshifts. I selected a sample of 11 clumpy galaxies at z~0.6 from the representative sample of emission line, intermediate-mass galaxies IMAGES. Selection was based on rest-frame UV morphology from HST/ACS images, mimicking the selection criteria commonly used at higher redshifts. Their spatially-resolved kinematics were derived in the frame of the IMAGES survey, using the VLT/FLAMES-GIRAFFE multi-integral field spectrograph. For those showing large-scale rotation, I derived the Toomre Q parameter, which characterizes the stability of their gaseous and stellar phases. I find that the fraction of UV-selected clumpy galaxies at z~0.6 is 20+/-12%. Roughly half of them (45+/-30%) have complex kinematics inconsistent with Jeans-unstable disks, while those in the remaining half (55+/-30%) show large-scale rotations.

The intermediate zone is bounded by the reactive shock (inner side) and the so-called precursor shock (outer side), for which Rankine-Hugoniot conditions are written; the solution in this zone is governed by two ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically. We show that, for any admissible precursor shock speed, the construction combining this numerical resolution with the exploitation of jump conditions is unique, and yields decreasing pressure, density and velocity profiles in the intermediate zone.

This is particularly true in the case of exoplanets close to their stars, for which one has to account both for an (often intense) irradiation flux, and from an intrinsic flux responsible for the progressive loss of the inner planetary heat. The goals of the present work are to help understanding the coupling between radiative transfer and advection in exoplanetary atmospheres and to provide constraints on the temperatures of the deep atmospheres. This is crucial in assessing whether modifying assumed opacity sources and/or heat transport may explain the inflated sizes of a significant number of giant exoplanets found so far. I use a simple analytical approach inspired by Eddington's approximation for stellar atmospheres to derive a relation between temperature and optical depth valid for plane-parallel static grey atmospheres which are both transporting an intrinsic heat flux and receiving an outer radiation flux.

To better understand the accumulation and allocation of capital among different sectors, the present paper applies this statistical fields description to a large number of heterogeneous agents divided into two groups. The first group is composed of a large number of firms in different sectors that collectively own the entire physical capital. The second group, investors, holds the entire financial capital and allocates it between firms across sectors according to investment preferences, expected returns, and stock prices variations on financial markets. In return, firms pay dividends to their investors. Financial capital is thus a function of dividends and stock valuations, whereas physical capital is a function of the total capital allocated by the financial sector. Whereas our previous work focused on the background fields that describe potential long-term equilibria, here we compute the transition functions of individual agents and study their probabilistic dynamics in the background field, as a function of their initial state.

I've been doing rows and negatives, and band assisted pull ups and I'm not getting any progress.   \n\n\nI thought that I was being impatient but after 2 months my best workouts peak at 3x6. I suspect that losing some weight might help but I'm not very overweight (6'1\" 200 lbs) and my weight isn't stopping my progress in any other exercise. Just this one.  \n\n\nAny advice aside from just doing the same stuff? Thanks.\nOnlyHereToWatch11: Also - are you getting 8 hours sleep every night and eating enough "

So far as I see it, the universe has no purpose. Purpose can only be defined in terms of an end. Theists have the idea that things exist as they do in order that something might come about as a consequence of their condition: the satisfaction of god\u2019s will. But this begs the question, \u201cwhat purpose is there to god\u2019s condition?\u201d. The nature of god\u2019s will is surely just as arbitrary as the condition of the universe in his absence. Therefore nothing suffices as an ultimate purpose-giver, and There is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference. \nscartol: What is the purpose of a tree? Obviously it will be quite different to the termite and the badger, yes? Couldn't we say the same about the universe?\nHolrloge220: That does not concern ultimate purpose. The purposes which you mention all have ends which are in terms of the needs of the organisms which rely on the universe (analogised by the tree).

We rely on a sequence of three convection-driven simulations in a rapidly rotating spherical shell. The most extreme case reaches towards the Earth's core regime by lowering viscosity (magnetic Prandtl number Pm=0.1) while maintaining vigorous convection (magnetic Reynolds number Rm>500) and rapid rotation (Ekman number E=1e-7), at the limit of what is feasible on today's supercomputers. A detailed and comprehensive analysis highlights several key features matching geomagnetic observations or dynamo theory predictions -- all present together in the same simulation -- but it also unveils interesting insights relevant for Earth's core dynamics.In this strong-field, dipole-dominated dynamo simulation, the magnetic energy is one order of magnitude larger than the kinetic energy. The spatial distribution of magnetic intensity is highly heterogeneous, and a stark dynamical contrast exists between the interior and the exterior of the tangent cylinder (the cylinder parallel to the axis of rotation that circumscribes the inner core).In the interior, the magnetic field is strongest, and "

Ideally, the formal verification of a compiler should include the formal verification of each component of the tool-chain. An example is the CompCert project, a formally verified C compiler, that comes with associated tools and proofs that allow to formally verify most of those components. However, some components, in particular the lexer, remain unverified. In fact, the lexer of Compcert is generated using OCamllex, a lex-like OCaml lexer generator that produces lexers from a set of regular expressions with associated semantic actions. Even though there exist various approaches, like CakeML or Verbatim++, to write verified lexers, they all have only limited practical applicability. In order to contribute to the end-to-end verification of compilers, we implemented a generator of verified lexers whose usage is similar to OCamllex. Our software, called Coqlex, reads a lexer specification and generates a lexer equipped with a Coq proof of its correctness. It provides a formally verified implementation of most features of standard, unverified lexer generators. The conclusions of our work are two-fold: "

The cirque is an almost circular hole or valley carved by a glacier that retreated over 8,000 years ago. As is true with the rest of the Winds, the mountains are composed almost entirely of granite. The Continental Divide spans the crest of the main peaks.\nThe towers average 1,000 feet (300 m) lower in altitude than the highest mountains in the northern Winds, with Lizard Head Peak (12,847 ft (3,916 m)) being the tallest. Other individual mountains in the cirque include Shark's Nose, Warbonnet, Warrior Peak, Wolfs Head and Pingora Peak. There are hundreds of routes to choose from in difficulties ranging from 5.1 to 5.11a and since "

On top of this, the US requires those with foreign bank accounts over $10,000 to file an FBAR form to declare it and their assets.

It is shown that for any (non-homogeneous) purely diffusing system, under any isotropic uniform incidence, the average length of trajectories through the system (the average length of the random walk trajecto-ries from entry point to first exit point) is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion process and therefore depends only on the geometry of the system. This exact invariance property may be seen as a generalization to diffusion of the well known mean-chord-length property [1], leading to broad physics and biology applications. Let us first consider a practical animal-biology example that was at the origin of the theoretical work reported hereafter. It is well established, for diverse species, that the spontaneous displacement of insects such as ants, on an horizontal planar surface, may be accurately mod-eled as a constant-speed diffusion random-walk [2-4]. We assume that a circle of radius R is drawn on the surface and we measure the average time that ants spend inside the circle when they enter it (see Fig. 1). The last assumption is "

Yet, human behaviour is a key element in predicting the human impact of an earthquake, therefore, it is important to include it in quantitative risk assessment studies. In this study, an interdisciplinary approach simulating pedestrians' evacuation during earthquakes at the city scale is developed using an agent-based model. The model integrates the seismic hazard, the physical vulnerability as well as individuals' behaviours and mobility. The simulator is applied to the case of Beirut, Lebanon. Lebanon is at the heart of the Levant fault system that has generated several Mw>7 earthquakes, the latest being in 1759. It is one of the countries with the highest seismic risk in the Mediterranean region. This is due to the high seismic vulnerability of the buildings due to the absence of mandatory seismic regulation until 2012, the high level of urbanization, and the lack of adequate spatial planning and risk prevention policies.

CMV\nThe reason that I believe this is because there have been many cases where the victim of rape conceives a child and the convicted rapist has parental rights over it after they have served time in jail. If the victim decides that they want to give the child up for adoption, they must first receive written permission from the rapist. This means that they must go to their own rapist, request for the child to be put up to adoption, and have them sign a form. I cannot even imagine the psychological turmoil that this would have on the victim. There have been cases where the victim wants to give the child to adoption, but the rapists will only agree to consent if the victim does not testify against the rapist. I believe that there is a total of 31 states who currently allow rapists to request and hold parental rights over their rape-conceived children. For example, in this article, a woman was raped and conceived a child. When the child was 6 years old, the rapist wanted parental rights over it. http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/01/us/rapist-child-custody/ \n\nEdit: Due "

It involves the implementation and immediate utilization of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that are also aspect-oriented (DSALs). However, while DSL development is affordable thanks to modern language workbenches, DSAL development lacks similar tool support. Consequently, LOM is often impractical and underutilized. The challenge we address is making the complexity of DSAL implementation comparable to that of DSLs and the effectiveness of programming with DSALs comparable to that of general-purpose aspect languages (GPALs). Today, despite being essentially both domain-specific and aspect-oriented, DSALs seem to be second-class. Aspect development tools (e.g., AJDT) do not work on DSAL code. DSL development tools like language workbenches (e.g., Spoofax) neither deal with the backend weaving nor handle the composition of DSALs.

Because if Catalonia receive independence from Spain, they will apply to become a member of the EU in order to still receive the benefits. In order to become a member, all existing states need to accept Catalonia unanimously. Its hard to imagine Spain accepting them into the EU.\n\nEven if they manage to get into the EU, this could trigger a similar situation in many other regions in Europe. Belgium is a prime example, a Belgian friend told me that the Walloon region wants to separate and have its own independent state.\n\nThis could trigger similar situations in many countries, then eventually many laws and trade agreements would have to be revised, and the European economy could potentially descend into chaos.\n\nI'll be honest once again, I do not know that much about the situation yet, its just an outside view of how things could pan out for me.

Prognostic markers are useful to stratify the patients into groups, guiding towards precise medicine discovery. The widely used prognostic markers in cancers include stage, size, grade, node and metastasis. In addition to these common markers, there are prognostic markers specific to different cancer types. For example estrogen level, progesterone and HER2 are markers specific to breast cancer patients. There is evidence showing that genes behaving as tumor suppressors or carcinogens could act as prognostic markers due to altered gene expression or mutation. Besides genetic biomarkers, there are also biomarkers that are detected in plasma or body fluid which can be metabolic or protein biomarkers.\nTraditional prognostic markers in oncology include tumor size, staging, lymph node spreading status, and metastasis. Large tumor, late staging, presence of cancer cells in multiple distant lymph nodes, and observation of metastasis often associate with poor prognosis.\nIn recent years, advances in molecular techniques, genomics, cancer biology and sequencing technology have provided opportunities "

This idea has a fair bit of support and got me thinking.  Shouldn't anyone taking my tax dollars have to prove to me they aren't spending the money on drugs?  Veterans want a check, piss in a cup please.  Same for politicians, police officers, firemen, really anyone getting a government pension or benefit.  Some of these are already tested as a requirement for getting the job so why not all of them?  Is it possible to have a policy like this that could be fair to everyone?\n\nEdit: Im a bit surprised at the turn this has taken, I never claimed that I was for the drug testing of people on welfare in the first place, which seems to have become my assumed position.  I simply stated that it has an amount of support in my state, which I don't think I mentioned is Michigan.  I understand the non effectiveness of testing welfare recipients, as many people have pointed out.  The view I'm espousing here is that if those welfare recipients should have to put up with the invasion of privacy, loss of dignity, and everything "

The primary goal is that someone answers and engages with whatever scam they're running i.e IRS, car warranty, Amazon purchase or whatever. \n\nHowever, the system also tracks anytime someone declines the call because that means it is a legitimate person's cell phone number as opposed to an out-of-service number or an office line. By declining, your number ends up in a database for future calls that can be more targeted or persistent. \n\nThe robo-caller groups frequently use this as a secondary revenue stream by selling the list of confirmed numbers to more sophisticated scammers. This also applies to \"replying STOP\" to scam text messages. \n\nBy ignoring it altogether, you don't provide the system any information and they're less likely to try your number again in the future.\n\nTL;DR Just let calls from unknown numbers ring instead of declining and just delete spam text messages. Don't let them know you're real.\n\n\nEdit: Didn't think this would garner so much attention, but glad people are finding "

Sometimes these attempts are very subtle like \"Nobody should be able to say the N\\-word\" \\(implying that there are unfair restrictions on words with historically racialized significance especially when they are used by white males\\) Others are less nuanced, \"It is not racist to... {insert racially problematic statement here}.\" To me, there is always a possibility that an individual can do or say something racist, whether it's intended or not.\n\nI'm also aware of the argument that \"Because of the history of oppression against the people I identify with, there is no way for me to be racist.\" I am more sympathetic to this position \\(especially in the cases where particular demographic groups have been historically persecuted/despised/etc.\\) but don't consider this to be universally valid.

Creating such grammars is a costly and error-prone process, especially for realistic languages such as Java and C++. Approach: In this paper we present Concretely, a technique to extend meta programming systems with pluggable concrete syntax patterns, based on external, black box parsers. We illustrate Concretely in the context of Rascal, an open-source meta programming system and language workbench, and show how to reuse existing parsers for Java, "

This requires a \"bootstrap\": a copy of a previous version of the implementation is provided along with the sources, to be able to run the implementation itself. Those bootstrap files are opaque binaries; they could contain bugs, or even malicious changes that could reproduce themselves when running the source version of the language implementation -- this is called the \"trusting trust attack\". For this reason, a collective project called Bootstrappable was launched in 2016 to remove those bootstraps, providing alternative build paths that do not rely on opaque binaries. Inquiry: Debootstrapping generally combines a mix of two approaches. The \"archaeological\" approach works by locating old versions of systems, or legacy alternative implementations, that do not need the bootstrap, and by preserving or restoring the ability to run them. The \"tailored\" approach re-implements a new, non-bootstrapped implementation of the system to debootstrap. Currently, the \"tailored\" approach is dominant for low-level system components (C, coreutils), and the \"archaeological\" approach "

        "text": "Object-oriented languages often use virtual machines (VMs) that provide mechanisms such as just-in-time (JIT) compilation and garbage collection (GC). These VM components are typically implemented in a separate layer, isolating them from the application. While this approach brings the software engineering benefits of clear separation and decoupling, it introduces barriers for both understanding VM behavior and evolving the VM implementation. For example, the GC and JIT compiler are typically fixed at VM build time, limiting arbitrary adaptation at run time. Furthermore, because of this separation, the implementation of the VM cannot typically be inspected and debugged in the same way as application code, enshrining a distinction in easy-to-work-with application and hard-to-work-with VM code. These characteristics pose a barrier for application developers to understand the engine on top of which their own code runs, and fosters a knowledge gap that prevents application developers to change the VM. We propose Live Metacircular Runtimes (LMRs) to overcome this problem. LMRs are language runtime systems that seamlessly integrate the VM into the application in live programming environments. "

My house was built in 1953, and has an addition that was built sometime in the 1990s. Where the power meets the house, there's a large breaker box with the meter on one side, and a row of breakers on the other. One is the main breaker, one goes to the a/c unit outside, one goes around the house to the addition (which has its own breaker panel inside), one goes inside the house to a screw-in type fuse panel, and one breaker goes to an opening in the wall near the panel and is apparently connected to the outlets &amp; lights I am having a problem with.\n\nFor the past few months we've had low voltage (like 83v) at these affected outlets and lights, and I've been opening every switch, outlet, and ceiling light looking for loose or broken wires. I didn't find any, but anywhere I found wires crimped together, I cut the crimp off, stripped the wires and twisted and capped them. This didn't help the low voltage problem. I replaced every switch and outlet that was affected -- no change. I tested every circuit in the fuse panel inside the house, and there were I believe 2 circuits in the house that "

Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, decided to advance into Germany on a broad front in 1944, against the suggestions of his principal subordinates, Lieutenant Generals Omar Bradley and George S. Patton and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, who argued instead to stage competing advances on narrow fronts. The decision was controversial initially because the British government wanted to raise the profile of the minority British contingent in what was by then an overwhelmingly American army, and they perceived that a British-led thrust to Berlin would achieve this aim. Montgomery's strident advocacy raised political and nationalistic complications that strained the wartime alliance. During the subsequent Cold War, suggestions were made that the Soviet presence in Eastern Europe may have been reduced had Eisenhower sent a narrow-front thrust to race the USSR to Berlin in 1945.\nEisenhower's decision was based on both political and military factors. There were serious reservations in the autumn of 1944 about whether the Allied logistical system could support the narrow-front strategy, because "

At very high resistance (and thus, slow speed) we still train power, and at light resistance and fast speed, we are still training strength (as long as you're having to produce a force to increase or maintain that speed).\n\nAs with everything else in resistance training, specificity is key. We get stronger, and more powerful, at the speeds that we train at. Furthermore, we get stronger at those speeds for the specific muscle lengths (and thus joint angles) that we train at. So if you move fast from the bottom of a pull up, but then move slowly after that, you're going to get stronger at moving quickly during the bottom of the pull up only, you won't magically get stronger and faster at the top angles.\n\nThe adaptation at each speed and joint angle is going to be proportional to the effort we put in relative to our maximum ability.

Based on Hirschbergs algorithm, Dynamic Programming needs O(kN^(k-1)) space to store both the search frontier and the nodes needed to reconstruct the solution path, for k sequences of length N.

Sorry for not answering for a long time - I was on vacation outside the city and there was no connection.\" She was honest about it because I saw from her stories, though when she replied it was like nine days past the New Year and I texted her on NYE. With that being said, my texts have always been very long so whether or not she was sincere it probably didn't matter that much. There's been a general trend of her replying once every week. But I've also noticed that when I wrote something that she didn't felt comfortable answering, for example I asked her if she liked to watch any Halloween movies over Halloween, then she took a longer time to reply and then came back at the "

Series to have featured the trophy include the World Sportscar Championship, the FIA GT Cup, the World Touring Car Championship, the European Touring Car Championship, the FIA GT Championship, the British Touring Car Championship, the FIA GT1 World Championship, and the overall winners of the British GT Championship in the 1999, 2000, 2003 and 2004 seasons. It has been presented to the overall winners of the Silverstone Circuit round of the FIA World Endurance Championship from 2013 on.\nThe race was first contested on the Isle of Man in 1905 and continued to be held on the island until 1922. It moved to the Ards Circuit on Northern Ireland's public roads in 1928 after an article written by the journalist Wallace McLeod in a Belfast newspaper suggested it occur in the area and the inventor Harry Ferguson helped the RAC to find a suitable "

Few additional analytical results have been obtained for other spatially distributed predator-prey systems, as traveling waves of non-monotonous systems are notoriously difficult to obtain. Traveling waves have indeed recently been shown to exist in predator-prey systems, but the direction of the wave, an essential item of information in the context of the control of biological invasions, is generally unknown. Preliminary numerical explorations have hinted that control by generalist predators might be possible for prey populations displaying logistic growth. We aimed to formalize the conditions in which spatial biological control can be achieved by generalists, through an analytical approach based on reaction-diffusion equations.

This can also cause your heart to beat harder, causing anxiety.\nWhy YSK: if you are already prone to depression or anxiety, dehydration makes it feel much worse, and it's so easy to do by accident. Because you don't have enough volume of blood, its harder for your body to maintain blood flow. This causes your body to mimic the symptoms of depression (fatigue, brain fog, dizziness), which can cause you to think the depressed thoughts, causing your brain to make depression chemicals. When that makes you feel shitty enough, your heart will try to fix it by beating harder, raising your blood pressure, mimicking anxiety. Additionally, it becomes harder for your blood to carry oxygen, making you breathe harder, which for me is the one that causes me to panic.\n\nThis isn't a WoW tHaNkS iM cUrEd, but for me personally makes a huge difference.

        "text": "The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Due to the plasma screening effect, the color attraction between the heavy quark antiquark pair inside a quarkonium is significantly suppressed at high temperature and thus no bound states can exist, i.e., they \"melt\". In addition, a bound heavy quark antiquark pair can dissociate if enough energy is transferred to it in a dynamical process inside the plasma. So one would expect the production of quarkonium to be considerably suppressed in heavy ion collisions. However, experimental measurements have shown that a large amount of quarkonia survive the evolution inside the high temperature plasma. It is realized that the in-medium recombination of unbound heavy quark pairs into quarkonium is as crucial as the melting and dissociation. Thus, phenomenological studies have to account for static screening, dissociation and recombination in a consistent way. But recombination is less understood theoretically than the melting and dissociation. Many studies using semi-classical transport equations model the recombination effect from the consideration of detailed balance "

It has to be low cost because my parents are not millionaires and my mom already has several home improvement projects started that take up the budget.

For the ceiling I would tear out the pressboard and old lights we have now, run any electrical I need again, and install a new ceiling using some inexpensive material and install some new lighting fixtures.

To get the same pressure from water as a typical countertop sealer does from atmospheric pressure, you'd have to submerge your bag to about 20 feet, or more than twice the depth of a typical in-ground backyard pool. (32.8 feet would be needed to achieve a full atmosphere difference - but then again, a countertop vacuum sealer would have to draw a perfect vacuum in order to get a 1 atmo gradient).\n\nSo because of the minuscule amount of pressure supplied, the water method will still leave plenty of air in the bag - it'll just be trapped as smaller bubbles around and within the food.

This is a rare condition, previously reported in only four families. In contrast, heterozygous GRN mutations are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia associated with neuronal cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. We identified homozygous GRN mutations in six new patients. The phenotypic spectrum is much broader than previously reported, with two remarkably distinct presentations, depending on the age of onset. A childhood/juvenile form is characterized by classical CLN11 symptoms at an early age at onset. Unexpectedly, other homozygous patients presented a distinct delayed phenotype of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism after 50 years; none had epilepsy or cerebellar ataxia.

A wealth of techniques for managing and curating data (and its provenance) have been proposed, largely in the database community. In particular, a number of influential papers have proposed collecting provenance information explaining where a piece of data was copied from, or what other records were used to derive it. Most of these techniques, however, exist only as research prototypes and are not available in mainstream database systems. This means scientists must either implement such techniques themselves or (all too often) go without. This is essentially a code reuse problem: provenance techniques currently cannot be implemented reusably, only as ad hoc, usually unmaintained extensions to standard databases. An alternative, relatively unexplored approach is to support such techniques at a higher abstraction level, using metaprogramming or reflection techniques.

The population size of these mountain bird tends to decline on the reference sites and shows differences according to changes in local landscape characteristics. Habitat changes are at the centre of the identified pressures impacting part or all of its life cycle, according to experts. Hence, an approach to monitor population dynamics, is trough modelling the favourable habitats of Black Grouse breeding (nesting sites). Then, coupling modelling with multi-source remote sensing data (medium and very high spatial resolution), allowed the implementation of a spatial distribution model of the species. Indeed, the extraction of variables from remote sensing helped to describe the area studied at appropriate spatial and temporal scales: horizontal and vertical structure (heterogeneity), functioning (vegetation indices), phenology (seasonal or inter-annual dynamics) and biodiversity. An annual time series of radiometric indices (NDVI, NDWI, BI {\\ldots}) from Sentinel-2 has made it possible to generate Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) to derive phenological indications on the nature and dynamics "

However, in countries with high levels of HIV and poor access to condoms or poor education about safe sex, performing infant circumcisions can be a simple and cost effective way of reducing its spread.\nnumb3red: Ah, as in Africa's mass circumcision.\n\n&gt;Three studies in Africa several years ago that claimed that circumcision prevented AIDS and that circumcision was as effective as a 60% effective vaccine (Auvert 2005, 2006).

As accurate modelling of the sources of variability is a cornerstone to intelligent decision making, we investigate the consequences of the assumption of independent and identically distributed variables that is often made when modelling sources of variability such as down-times, arrivals, or process-times. We first explain the experiment setting that allows, through simulations and statistical tests, to measure the variability potential stored in a specific sequence of data. We show from industrial data that dependent behaviors might actually be the rule with potentially considerable consequences in terms of cycle time. As complex industries require strong levers to allow their tractability, this work underlines the need for a richer and more accurate modelling of real systems.

The drops are in an atmosphere of nitrogen saturated with water where they grow by condensation and eventually touch each other and coalesce. A new convex composite drop is rapidly formed that then exponentially and slowly relaxes to an equilibrium hemispherical cap. The characteristic relaxation time is proportional to the drop radius R * at final equilibrium. This relaxation time appears to be nearly 10 7 times larger than the bulk capillary relaxation time t b = R * $\\eta$/$\\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is the gas--liquid surface tension and $\\eta$ is the liquid shear viscosity. In order to explain this extremely large relaxation time, we consider a model that involves an Arrhenius kinetic factor resulting from a liquid--vapour phase change in the vicinity of the contact line. The model results in a large relaxation time of order t b exp(L/RT) where L is the molar latent heat of vaporization, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature.

Insulin, released by the pancreas, is the hormone the body uses to take sugar out of the blood (where it is transported) and into cells that need it. This is usually skeletal muscle cells - so your muscles. Most things that you eat are converted into glucose (sugar) for use the body. Sweet foods, Carbohydrates, protein (sometimes), etc.\n\n\nSo there are three different types of diabetes. Type I, Type II, and gestational. Ill be focusing on the first two. The word \"diabetes\" comes from Greek, and it literally means excessive discharge of urine. This is one of the symptoms of diabetes. The excess urination (polyuria) is due to high sugar levels in the blood. High sugar is actually toxic to the individual, so the body - specifically kidneys- attempts to rid the elevated glucose levels, and its end product is urination. Other symptoms are excessive hunger (polyphagia) and excessive thirst "

        "text": "In a one-dimensional (1D) disordered potential, quantum interferences leading to Anderson lo-calization are ubiquitous, such that all wave-functions are exponentially localized. Moreover, no phase transition toward delocalization is expected in 1D. This behavior is strongly modified in the presence of a bias force. We experimentally study this case, launching a non-interacting 39 K Bose-Einstein condensate in a 1D disordered potential induced by a far-off-resonance laser speckle, while controlling a bias force. In agreement with theoretical predictions, we observe a transition between algebraic localization and delocalization as a function of our control parameter that is the relative strength of the disorder against the bias force. We also demonstrate that the initial velocity of the wave-packet only plays a role through an effective disorder strength due to the correlation of the disorder. Adding a bias force is a quite natural way to probe the transport properties of quantum systems, a subject of broad interest that can be in particular addressed with atomic quantum gases thanks to their high degree of control and versatility [1].

I need to \"get up in there\" to do some network wiring and there are a couple of problems. Minor problem is that the basement was rented out so noise was an issue so there's actual insulation between the tiles and the 1st floor joists. That makes lifting the tiles a bit problematic, both in terms of pure vertical space available and angling the tiles to get, say, my arm up there.  \n\nBiggest problem, for me, however, is the \"tightness\" of the tiles. Meaning they fit quite snugly into their grid squares. So much so that getting a lifted tile to nestle all the way back down is difficult.  In other houses, I've been able to just \"tap\" the tiles quickly upwards and their subsequent downward momentum caused them to fall into place. That kinda sorta works here, but it takes MANY taps and some just won't drop, and I'm afraid I'm going to break one.  \n\nI'm hoping there's some \"trick of the trade\" or life hack or whatever that someone knows which makes lowering such tiles back into place easy, or at least not this friggin' "

The missions take place between Black Ops II and III chronologically. Some of the Specialists also carried over from Black Ops III. The multiplayer mode is the first in the series to not feature automatic health regeneration and introduces both predictive recoil and a new ballistics system. The game included three Zombies experiences on release day, four if a special edition of the game, or the Black Ops Pass, was purchased.

They allow formalizing the syntax of domain-specific or general-purpose programming languages concisely and declaratively. However, the natural and concise way of writing a context-free grammar is often ambiguous. Therefore, grammar formalisms support extensions in the form of *declarative disambiguation rules* to specify operator precedence and associativity, solving ambiguities that are caused by the subset of the grammar that corresponds to expressions. **Inquiry** Implementing support for declarative disambiguation within a parser typically comes with one or more of the following limitations in practice: a lack of parsing performance, or a lack of modularity (i.e., disallowing the composition of grammar fragments of potentially different languages). The latter subject is generally addressed by scannerless generalized parsers. We aim to equip scannerless generalized parsers with novel disambiguation methods that are inherently performant, without compromising the concerns of modularity and language composition. **Approach** In this paper, we present a novel low-overhead implementation technique "

I am very new to socialization and trying to have friends so if my problem seems inane or simple please be understanding. \n\nI want to be with a woman named X, but recently my actions haven't been true to that desire. I met her a semester ago through hearing her sweet voice, she is Chinese and I really enjoyed talking to her because I am learning Chinese and she has a wonderful personality. She actually seems to care about what I think which is incredible for me because when I talk to other people I hear so many only care about talking about themselves, but this information is tangential. The point is that after weekly visits and discussions I believe we developed a fondness for each other even though she is ten years older than me. Which, coupled by the fact that I am a black guy is probably going to be a deterrent in my courtship of her, so I am worried about the stability of her affection towards me.  \nThe problem is that the semester "

The RR is more akin to supersets because it interleaves exercises to allow for more rest.\nWhy is this better for beginners? Because the single most important thing for a beginner is working on form. Fatigue degrades form and should therefore be minimized for beginners.\n\nI didn't bother reading your examples because I assume they were made up. It's only logical that you can work at higher intensities when you have rest. Now, minimizing rest can be a good way of increasing intensity but it's not the be all end all of fitness.\nYou also failed to indicate why single sets are standard in fitness.

Family members later became involved in shipping, steel and banking. The family is particularly known for its close association with Henrik Ibsen.\nTwo brothers from Oslo who both became priests, Hans (1587\u20131648) and Peder Povelsson Paus (1590\u20131653), have long been known as the family's earliest certain ancestors. In his book Slekten Paus, S.H.

There's an important point to understand about engines: they are optimized for a fixed rotation speed. Optimally around 2000 - 3000 rpm.\nWhen the engine is accelerating, the speed is changing, and its fuel usage is not optimized. So, try to keep the engine speed as constant as possible, and this means driving in a *cool* mood.\n\n    EDIT: The optimal RPM is dependent on the car model, and can be as low as 1500, and it's a range, not a specific number. Test with your car and see where you get the most acceleration.\n\n2. 2nd point is braking is what wastes your energy. Look 2 cars ahead of you when you're driving. If you know you'll need to brake soon, do not push the gas pedal. Keep an able safety distance.\n\n3. Opening the windows and having extra attachments to the car increases air drag and wastes energy. If not required, keep the windows shut, especially on the high way. Using the air conditioner on the highway is more efficient.\n\n"

First, databases are unaware of application users, and creating a new database user for each application user is impractical for applications with many users. Second, different components of the same application may require different authority, which would require creating different database users for different software components. Thus, it is difficult to use existing tools to properly limit the authority an application has when executing queries.

I.e., take two otherwise identical computers and load one with Windows, the other Linux,  and you have two objects with different physical properties. It's quite obvious without a philosophical lens, not to denigrate philosophy in any way. In the same manner of speaking we talk about minds.\n\nwokeupabug: Is this comment supposed to be addressed to me?\n\n&gt; I would argue that there is a loaded sense of information in that.\n\nThe only reference I make to \"information\" in my comment is a quote of your statement about information, so I don't see how I can be critiqued for introducing a loaded sense of information.\n\n&gt; Saying that some information states have phenomenal states is just to understand what those information states (or whatever) are.\n\nNo, it's not: having phenomenal "

The advantage of this logical formalism is that it offers a declarative representation of statistical knowledge; knowledge represented in this manner can be used for a variety of reasoning tasks. The logic differs from previous work in probability logics in that it uses a probability distribution over the domain of discourse, whereas most previous work (e.g., Nilsson [2], Scott et al. [3], Gaifinan [4], Fagin et al. [5]) has investigated the attachment of probabilities to the sentences of the logic (also, see Halpern [6] and Bacchus [7] for further discussion of the differences). The logic Lp possesses some further important features. First, Lp is a superset of first order logic, hence it can represent ordinary logical assertions. This means that Lp provides a mechanism for integrating statistical information and reasoning about uncertainty into systems based solely on logic. Second, Lp possesses transparent semantics, based on sets and probabilities of those sets. Hence, knowledge represented in Lp can be "

Should I suffer the pain of extending the window jam or just wrap and replace siding?\nDIY Redditers, you have done me well as I'm starting to update/retrofit some things in my old house. I need some more help, though.\n\nI am about to [build a deck] (http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/28aypd/deck_diy_questions_posts_and_beam_dont_want_to/) but first I need to [replace some siding](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/28bk03/one_question_for_homeowners_where_do_you_get_your/). I plan on replacing siding and [retrimming all the windows] (http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/2441jh/need_help_in_fixing_window_sills_image_in/) (long term). I plan on replacing the \"trim (1x4) over lap\" to \"lap butted to trim (2x4)\" and slanting all the bottom trim down.\n\nAs I began to remove some siding, I realized my house as no sheathing or wrap (house built in '40s). It does have the pink fiberglass insulation. From the outside: lap siding, insulation, something wood (I'm assuming old paneling), sheetrock.\n\nMy question is:\n\n**Should I suffer the pain of adding sheathing, foam, and furring?** This would require me to move an exterior door "

Other engineering examples (control theory, elasticity theory, electromagnetism) will also be considered in order to illustrate the three fundamental results that we shall provide. The paper is therefore divided into three parts corresponding to the different formal methods used. 1) CARTAN VERSUS VESSIOT: The quadratic terms appearing in the \" Riemann tensor \" according to the \" Vessiot structure equations \" must not be identified with the quadratic terms appearing in the well known \" Cartan structure equations \" for Lie groups and a similar comment can be done for the \" Weyl tensor \". In particular, \" curvature+torsion\" (Cartan) must not be considered as a generalization of \"curvature alone\" (Vessiot). Roughly, Cartan and followers have not been able to \" quotient down to the base manifold \", a result only obtained by Spencer in 1970 through the \"nonlinear Spencer sequence\" but in a way quite different "

        "text": "A theory of Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances for stochastic differential systems is presented. These resonances are defined as the eigenvalues of the generator (Kolmogorov operator) of a given stochastic system. By relying on the theory of Markov semigroups, decomposition formulas of correlation functions and power spectral densities (PSDs) in terms of RP resonances are then derived. These formulas describe, for a broad class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), how the RP resonances characterize the decay of correlations as well as the signal's oscillatory components manifested by peaks in the PSD.It is then shown that a notion reduced RP resonances can be rigorously defined, as soon as the dynamics is partially observed within a reduced state space V . These reduced resonances are obtained from the spectral elements of reduced Markov operators acting on functions of the state space V , and can be estimated from series. They inform us about the spectral elements of some coarse-grained version of the SDE generator. When the time-lag at which the transitions are collected from partial observations in V , is either sufficiently small or large, it is shown that the reduced RP resonances "

One thing that really stuck out to me is that most restrooms here don't have paper towels or an electric hand dryer.  I didn't really know what to think, and I spent the first few weeks drying my hands on my hair, (killing two birds with one stone by conveniently styling it at the same time, haha) or on my pants.

Such a simple solution that solves many problems and is environmentally friendly as well.  Think about how many rolls of paper towel are used in every US bathroom every year...  Long story short - carry a handkerchief to dry your hands instead of using paper towels.

Yeah, it sounds ridiculous but hear me out. A happy person is for the most part content. He/she wants for very little and sees little value in expensive possessions. Less consumerism equals less economic growth plain and simple, but there's a sinister side to this all I think. We all know corporate fat-cats collaborate and meet with government officials. Lobbyists appeal to them and try to get legislation to work for them rather than the country as a whole so already we see a merging between government and big business. These same businesses run advertisements for products, dictate what stories to put on the news and what details to reveal, put chemicals into our environment and food sources, etc. In effect, the two are scratching each others' backs.
