It is shown that the initial orientation strongly affects the collision times and reaction mechanism. The highest collision times predicted by TDHF in this reaction are of the order of $\\sim4$ zs at a center of mass energy of 1200 MeV. According to modern calculations based on the Dirac equation, the collision times at $E_{cm}>1$ GeV are sufficient to allow spontaneous electron-positron pair emission from QED vacuum decay, in case of bare uranium ion collision. A second application of actinide collisions to produce neutron-rich transfermiums is discussed. A new inverse quasifission mechanism associated to a specific orientation of the nuclei is proposed to produce transfermium nuclei ($Z>100$) in the collision of prolate deformed actinides such as $^{232}$Th+$^{250}$Cf. The collision of the tip of one nucleus with the side of the other results in a nucleon flux toward the latter.

For example, if the female is the rapist and then conceives a child, then I believe that the convicted female rapist should not hold parental rights over it. This is because she would *hopefully* would have been convicted and sent to jail, thus the court would judge her to be an unfit parent. I also believe that the male victim should not have to pay child support. In this case, I believe that the child should go to a chosen family member issued by court or put up for adoption if the victim does not want to raise the child. Along with this, I believe that if the rapist has been rehabilitated and the victim agrees to allow them parental rights over court, then the rapist may have parental rights. However, this is only if the rapist has been convicted, serves their time, has been rehabilitated and has not blackmailed or threatened the victim into allowing them parental rights. \n[deleted]: You're looking at this from the perspective of the victim (person who was raped) but are failing to look at it form the child's perspective.

When all such intervals collapse to single points, the evidential logic reduces to probabilistic logic (in the generalized version of not necessarily consistent interpretations). Certainly, we get Nilsson's probabilistic logic by further restricting to consistent interpretations. In the third section, we shall give a probabilistic interpretation of probabilistic logic in terms of multi-dimensional random variables. This interpretation brings the probabilistic logic into the framework of probability theory. Let us consider a finite set S = {sl, s2, ..., Sn) of logical propositions. Each proposition may have true or false values; and may be considered as a random variable. We have a probability distribution for each proposition. The e-dimensional random variable (sl,..., Sn) may take values in the space of all interpretations of 2n binary vectors. We may compute absolute (marginal), conditional and joint probability distributions. It turns out that the permissible probabilistic interpretation vector of Nilsson [12] consists of the joint probabilities of S. Inconsistent interpretations will not appear, by setting their joint probabilities"

In this chapter we study two properties of the stationary solutions : the first property concerns the stability of these solutions where we prove that if we have a control on the external force then all non stationary solution (with depends of both spatial and temporal variables) converges toward a stationary solution.

Our first major contribution is to show that the 'degree of nonlinearity' of a neural architecture is a key causal driver behind its performance, and a primary aspect of the architecture's model complexity. We introduce the 'nonlinearity coefficient' (NLC), a scalar metric for measuring nonlinearity. Via extensive empirical study, we show that the value of the NLC in the architecture's randomly initialized state before training is a powerful predictor of test error after training and that attaining a right-sized NLC is essential for attaining an optimal test error. The NLC is also conceptually simple, well-defined for any feedforward network, easy and cheap to compute, has extensive theoretical, empirical and conceptual grounding, follows instructively from the architecture definition, and can be easily controlled via our 'nonlinearity normalization' algorithm. We argue that the NLC is the most powerful scalar statistic for architecture design specifically and neural network analysis in general. Our analysis is fueled by mean field theory, which we use to uncover the 'meta-distribution' of layers. Beyond the NLC, we uncover and flesh out"

In addition to this, readings that are faulty and emanate from possible sensor malfunctions are also eliminated.

We notice, through experiments, that this eliminates and thus reduces around 90% of the readings that need to be transmitted to the LPU leading to significant energy savings. Furthermore, the proper functioning of these algorithms in such constrained environments is confirmed and validated over a hardware simulation set up. The second tier of assessment includes a proposed anomaly detection model at the LPU that is capable of identifying anomalies from streaming health parameter readings and indicates an adverse medical condition. In addition to being able to handle streaming data, the model works within the resource-constrained environments of an LPU and eliminates the need of transmitting the data to a back-end cloud, ensuring further energy savings.

In particular, we carry out the first development in choreographic programming of a widespread real-world protocol: the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client--server protocol. The development is based on Choral, an object-oriented higher-order choreographic programming language (choreographies can be parametric on choreographies and carry state). We find that two of Choral's features are key to our implementation: higher-order choreographies are used for modelling the complex interaction patterns that arise due to IRC's asynchronous nature, while user-definable communication semantics are relevant for achieving interoperability with third-party implementations. In the process we also discover a missing piece: the capability of statically detecting that choices on alternative distributed behaviours are appropriately communicated by means of message types, for which we extend the Choral compiler with an elegant solution based on subtyping. Our Choral implementation of IRC arguably represents a milestone for choreographic programming, since it is the first"

Approach: We advocate for the benefits of \"tailored\" debootstrapping implementations of high-level languages. The new implementation needs not be production-ready, it suffices that it is able to run the reference implementation correctly. We argue that this is feasible with a reasonable development effort, with several side benefits besides debootstrapping. Knowledge: We propose a specific design of composing/stacking several implementations: a reference interpreter for the language of interest, implemented in a small subset of the language, and a compiler for this small subset (in another language). Developing a reference interpreter is valuable independently of debootstrapping: it may help clarify the language semantics, and can be reused for other purposes such as differential testing of the other implementations. Grounding: We present Camlboot, our project to debootstrap the OCaml compiler, version 4.07.

Using the new collisional coefficients, an electron density enhancement is still needed to explain the excitation of H13CO+ for extended emission and for gas temperatures of\\le 400 K toward L1448-mm (0,-10), and possibly also toward L1448-mm (0,0).

Indeed, it is a straightforward observation that the time required for finding the treasure is $\\Omega$(D + D 2 /k), and we show in this paper that this bound can be matched if the agents have knowledge of k up to some constant approximation. We present an almost tight bound for the competitive penalty that must be paid, in the running time, if agents have no information about k. Specifically, on the negative side, we show that in such a case, there is no algorithm whose competitiveness is O(log k). On the other hand, we show that for every constant $\\epsilon \\textgreater{} 0$, there exists a rather simple uniform search algorithm which is $O( \\log^{1+\\epsilon} k)$-competitive.

In the third pattern, higher expectations of long-term returns drive massive inputs of capital.Instability in capital accumulation may arise among and within sectors. We therefore widen our approach and study the dynamics of the collective configurations, in particular interactions between average capital and expected long-term returns, and show that overall stability crucially depends on the expectations' formation process.Expectations that are highly reactive to capital variations stabilize high capital configurations, and drive low-to-moderate capital sectors towards zero or a higher level of capital, depending on their initial capital.

The temperature of the heating surface grows so rapidly that the heater can fuse unless its power is controlled. This phenomenon is known under the names of \"boiling crisis,\" \"burnout,\" or \"Departure from Nucleate Boiling\" (DNB) [1]. The final state of this transition is called film boiling. This problem has become very important since the 1940's, with the beginning of the industrial exploitation of heat exchangers with large heat fluxes (as with nuclear power stations). Since then a huge amount of research has been done for the various conditions of pool boiling (boiling without imposed external flow) and flow boiling (boiling of the flowing water) [2]. Numerous empirical correlations have been proposed, each describing the dependence of the CHF on the physical parameters of the liquid and of the heater more or less correctly for a particular geometry and particular conditions of boiling [2]. A strong dependence of the threshold on the details of the experimental setup coupled with difficulties in separating the consequences of DNB from its causes is"

There are few considerations and caveats that should be addressed by language engineers that rely on language design aspects. The creation of a notebook for a DSL with Bacat\\'a becomes a matter of writing the code that wires existing language components in the Rascal language workbench with the Jupyter platform. Grounding: We evaluate Bacat\\'a by generating functional computational notebook interfaces for three different non-trivial DSLs, namely: a small subset of Halide (a DSL for digital image processing), SweeterJS (an extended version of JavaScript), and QL (a DSL for questionnaires).

The star-by-star differences of the spectroscopic minus the photometric metallicities show a wide range of values along the fiducial spectroscopic metallicity range, with the tendency to have systematically lower photometric metallicities for those dwarf spheroidals with a higher fraction of intermediate-age populations. Such discrepancies persist even in the case of the purely old Sculptor dSph, where one would na\\\"ively expect a very good match when comparing with medium or low resolution metallicity measurements. Overall, the agreement between Ca T metallicities and photometric metallicities is very good in the metallicity range from ~ -2 dex to ~ -1.5 dex. We find that the photometric method is reliable in galaxies that contain small (less than 15%) intermediate-age stellar fractions.

Law enforcement and the courts don't care about how you feel about politics, they will enforce the laws that other people have decided for you, if you decide to never voice your opinion/do something.\n\nAlso it is important to remember an individual's role in politics is certainly not restricted to casting a vote for the president once every four years. Every dollar you spend is a vote, remember this. Every minute you spend reading/watching media is a vote cast. Civil disobedience, boycotting, lobbying, running for office, strikes, protests, violent revolutions, those are all ways"

More precisely, we prove that starting from any initial solution and any step-size, linear convergence with probability one and in expectation occurs. Our proof holds on unimodal functions that are the composite of strictly increasing functions by positively homogeneous functions with degree $\\alpha$ (assumed also to be continuously differentiable). This function class includes composite of norm functions but also non-quasi convex functions. Because of the composition by a strictly increasing function, it includes non continuous functions. We find that a sufficient condition for global linear convergence is the step-size increase on linear functions, a condition typically satisfied for standard parameter choices.

The underlying idea is to conduct a series of searches with successively increasing upper bounds, but using the DP ordering as the key for the Open priority queue. With a suitable choice of thresholds, in practice, a running time below four times that of A* can be expected. In our experiments we show that our algorithm outperforms one of the currently most successful algorithms for optimal multiple sequence alignments, Partial Expansion A*, both in time and memory. Moreover, we apply a refined heuristic based on optimal alignments not only of pairs of sequences, but of larger subsets. This idea is not new; however, to make it practically relevant we show that it is equally important to bound the heuristic computation appropriately, or the overhead can obliterate any possible gain. Furthermore, we discuss a number of improvements in time and space efficiency with regard to practical implementations. Our algorithm, used in conjunction with higher"

Results: Using QCS enabled rapid identification of subjects with data anomalies allowing the user to correct the data series or reject them partially or entirely as well as identify fully valid datasets.

A smaller part of the theory was devoted to limit theory under extremal dependence for point processes, maxima, partial sums, tail empirical processes. Resnick [49, 50] started a systematic study of the relations between the convergence of point processes, sums and maxima, see also Resnick [51] for a recent account. He advocated the use of multivariate regular variation as a flexible tool to describe heavy-tail phenomena combined with advanced continuous mapping techniques. For example, maxima and sums are understood as functionals acting on an underlying point process, if the point process converges these functionals converge as well and their limits are described in terms of the points of the limiting point process. Davis and Hsing [13] recognized the power of this approach for limit theory of point processes, maxima, sums, and large deviations for dependent regularly varying processes, i.e., stationary sequences whose finite-dimensional distributions are regularly varying with the same index.

To this end we design an *acquaintance maintenance* mechanism: a new type of operator for functional reactive programming languages that we call `deploy-*`. The `deploy-*` operator enables correct and efficient reactions to time-varying collections of discovered prosumers. The proposed mechanisms are implemented in a reactive programming language called Stella, which serves as a linguistic vehicle to demonstrate the ideas of our approach. Our implementation of acquaintance management results in computationally efficient and idiomatic reactive code. We evaluate our approach quantitatively via benchmarks that show that our implementation is efficient: computations will efficiently update whenever a new prosumer is discovered, or a connected prosumer is dropped. To evaluate the distributed capabilities of our prototype implementation, we implement a use-case that simulates the bike-sharing infrastructure of Brussels, and we run it on a Raspberry Pi cluster computer.

These systems maintain a set of true/false propositions and their associated dependencies. However, situations often arise in which we are unsure of certain facts or in which the conclusions we can draw from available information are somewhat uncertain. The non-monotonic TMS 12] was an attempt at reasoning when all the facts are not known, but it fails to take into account degrees of belief and how available evidence can combine to strengthen a particular belief. This paper addresses the problem of probabilistic reasoning as it applies to Truth Maintenance Systems. It describes a belief Maintenance System that manages a current set of beliefs in much the same way that a TMS manages a set of true/false propositions. If the system knows that belief in fact is dependent in some way upon belief in fact2, then it automatically modifies its belief in facts when new information causes a change in belief of fact2. It models the behavior of a TMS, replacing its 3-valued logic (true, false, unknown) with an infinite valued logic"

Other solutions imply in any case that the present inflated radius of CoRoT-2b is transient and the result of an event that occurred less than 20 Ma ago: a giant impact with another Jupiter-mass planet, or interactions with another object in the system which caused a significant rise of the eccentricity followed by the rapid circularization of its orbit.

A rigorous and systematic method is essential to obtain the high-degree magneto-mechanical coupling terms and to build a free energy density function at any order which is invariant by the action of the cubic (octahedral) group. For that aim, theoretical and computer tools in Invariant Theory, that allow for the mathematical description of cubic nonlinear magneto-elasticity, are introduced. Minimal integrity bases of the invariant algebra for the pair (m, $\\sigma$), under the proper (orientation-preserving) and the full cubic groups, are then proposed. The minimal integrity basis for the proper cubic group is constituted of 60 invariants, while the minimal integrity basis for the full cubic group (the one of interest for magneto-elasticity) is made up of 30 invariants. These invariants are formulated in a (coordinate free) intrinsic manner, using a generalized cross product to write some of them. The counting of independent invariants of a given multi-degree in (m, $\\sigma$) is performed.

Most of the time I would go and play with these other apparatuses but I had no set routine/program.\n\n**So I decided to create a PROPER three-day-split with ALL the progression exercises listed to get to specific goals.** While there is lots of overlap in muscle-use in bodyweight fitness (they all practically use the core, for example), splitting up the pulling exercises from the pushing could help one progress faster.\n\nThis is my way of giving back to the OMB/calisthenics/bodyweight/gymnastics/yoga community, because 99% of you have been so wonderful, helpful and *inspiring.*\n\n**The page is a work in progress and it's being updated as I discover new ways to play with our bodies.  If you have suggestions, please, any feedback is appreciated.**\nBanthaFett: How much"

Tympanic allows implementors of Concretely to solve the impedance mismatch between object-oriented class hierarchies in Java and Rascal's algebraic data types. Both the algebraic data type and AST marshalling code is automatically generated. Knowledge: The conceptual architecture of Concretely and Tympanic supports the reuse of pre-existing, external parsers, and their AST representation in meta programming systems that feature concrete syntax patterns for matching and constructing syntax trees. As such this opens up concrete syntax pattern matching for a host of realistic languages for which writing a grammar from scratch is time consuming and error-prone, but for which industry-strength parsers exist in the wild. Grounding: We evaluate Concretely in terms of source lines of code (SLOC), relative to the size of the AST data type and marshalling code. We show that for real programming languages such as C++ and Java, adding support for concrete syntax patterns takes an effort only in the order of dozens of SLOC. Similarly, we evaluate Tympanic"

After a few weeks of talking to the rep and not getting any real offer to fix or make up for my paint, I went to my local reputable auto body shop and got an estimate to fix the paint.\n\nBlemishes under the clear coat generally can't be \"fixed\", gotta repaint usually. The auto body shop said they couldn't/wouldn't try to fix it but gave me an estimate to repaint the panels with flaws for $4800.\n\nI got nowhere with the auto rep again so I went to my local courthouse and filed a small claims with the auto manufacturer (not the dealer). The claim was filed for $6000. $4800 for the estimate and $1200 for putting up with weeks of their bullshit (a number I just pulled out of my ass).\n\nA week before the court date I got a letter from the manufacturer's legal department offering me $4800, the amount of the estimate.

Secondly, we will review these evolving technological and computational levels of abstraction and their influence on the different conceptions of the city. Thirdly, we will develop the hypothesis of a conceptual gap, between our current technological capacity -- grounded on the abundance and availability of urban data streams -- and the state of the art in urban modelling and city theory. Lastly, building upon Foucault's concept of episteme (Foucault, 1970) and genealogy (Foucault, 1977b), we will explore this gap by speculating around the possibility of an inversion in computational urban modelling and city theory. And above all, we will question the terms in which we can think of the city, in an age where the world can be virtually conceived as fully urban, and the continuity and abundance"

There are online things for lifting but if you specifically want calisthenics worked in (and I assume that you\u2019re talking about doing more than just basic movements as assistance work) that typically involves some tweaking on your part. \n\nSome lifting programs are more customisable than others. I\u2019m doing Average to Savage 2 by Greg Nuckols for example which is highly customisable. It wouldn\u2019t be difficult to work callisthenics and dumbbell stuff into it.

We find that the metrics from GLAS footprints are correlated with field AGB estimations (R 2 =0.54, RMSE=48.3 Mg/ha) with no bias for high values. First, predictive models, including remote-sensing, environmental variables and spatial correlation functions, allow us to obtain \"wall-to-wall\" AGB maps over French Guiana with an RMSE for the in situ AGB estimates of ~51 Mg/ha and R${}^2$=0.48 at a 1-km grid size. We conclude that a calibrated regression model based on GLAS with dependent environmental data can produce good AGB predictions even for high AGB values if the calibration data fit the AGB range. We also demonstrate that small temporal and spatial mismatches between field data and GLAS footprints are not a problem for regional and global calibrated regression models because field data aim to predict large and deep tendencies in AGB variations from environmental gradients and do not aim to represent high but stochastic and temporally limited variations from forest dynamics. Thus, we advocate including a greater variety of data, even if less precise and"

We estimated mass-loss rates and optical depths based on radio continuum brightnesses and Ha fluxes. We report two newly detected outbursts of AT 2000ch similar to those found in the 2000s and 13 re-brightening events, of which at least four are not conclusively detected because of insufficient sampling of the light curve. The dates of all outbursts and significant, well-sampled re-brightening events are consistent with a period of $\\sim 201 \\pm 12\\,$days over a total time-span of two decades. Such a behavior has never been found for any SN imposter, especially not for candidate SN~2009ip analogs. During 2010 to 2012 and 2014 to 2018, we only have a few detections, which is insufficient to come to any conclusion as to a possible less eruptive phase of the transient. We find steady dimming after the most recent re-brightening events and possible evidence of porosity in the circumstellar envelope, suggesting AT~2000ch may currently be in transition to a state of relative calm"

The individuals are characterized by parameters which have an influence on their survival or reproduction ability. Some of these parameters can be genetic and are inheritable except when mutations occur, but they can also be a space location or a quantity of parasites. The individuals compete for resources or other environmental constraints. We describe the population by a point measure-valued Markov process. We study macroscopic approximations of this process depending on the interplay between different scalings and obtain in the limit either integro-differential equations or reaction-diffusion equations or nonlinear super-processes. In each case, we insist on the specific techniques for the proof of convergence and for the study of the limiting model. The limiting processes offer different models of mutation-selection dynamics. Then, we study two-level models motivated by cell division dynamics, where the cell population is discrete and characterized by a trait, which may be continuous.

The user remains able to prove further properties of their lexer. Secondly, it is possible to combine simplicity and decent performance. Our implementation approach that uses Brzozowski derivatives is noticeably simpler than the previous work in Verbatim++ that tries to generate a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) ahead of time, and it is also noticeably faster thanks to careful design choices. We wrote several example lexers that suggest that the convenience of using Coqlex is close to that of standard verified generators, in particular, OCamllex. We used Coqlex in an industrial project to implement a verified lexer of Ada. This lexer is part of a tool to optimize safety-critical programs, some of which are very large.

While accuracy is crucial to this end, the inserted instrumentation code causes the execution of extra cycles, which are partially included in the profiles. To mitigate this issue, we estimate and compensate for the extra cycles caused by the inserted instrumentation code. We implement our approach in StreamProf that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first dedicated stream profiler for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). With StreamProf, we find that cycle profiling is effective to detect problematic streams whose optimization can enable significant performance gains. We also find that the accurate profiling of tasks supporting parallel stream processing allows the diagnosis of load imbalance according to the distribution of stream-related cycles at a thread level.

I realize the term is overloaded, but by \"strength training\" I mean you're optimizing for strength (instead of hypertrophy or endurance), so you're doing an exercise with enough weight (or a certain bodyweight progression) so that you can only do 3-6 reps each time without going to failure (leaving a bit in the tank for the next set), which is somewhere between 80-95% of your 1RM. Overall you're aiming for 3-6 sets of 3-6 reps, and it's recommended to rest 3-5 minutes between sets. Opinions may vary, but this is generally what I see as recommended if you're training for pure strength. In my case, I'm working weighted pull-ups in my current progression towards one arm pull ups, but AFAIK the same idea generally applies to any rep oriented exercise involving a major muscle group.\ngreenpoe: Stretch lower body on the upper body days, and vice versa.

Don't be afraid to crash and burn something. Have fun with it, people around and you know that you are awkward, maybe your face turns red, you circle around ideas or come exceptionally slow or unconnected.

You say a few things have fallen through -- that's pretty common in the adult world, honestly, where everyone is busy with life.

We start with a simple (first-order) model for reactivity, based on reactors (i.e. uninstantiated descriptions of signals and their dependencies) and deployments (i.e. instances of reactors) that consist of signals. The language does not have the notion of functions, and thus unlike other RP languages there is no lifting either. We extend this simple model incrementally with additional features found in other programming languages, RP or otherwise. These features include stateful reactors (that allow for time-based accumulation), signals with dynamic dependencies by means of conditionals and polymorphic deployments, recursively-defined reactors, and (anonymous) reactors with lexical scope. Knowledge: In our description of these language features, we not only describe the syntax and semantics, but also how each features compares to the problems that exist in (EDSL) RP languages. I.e. by starting from a reactive-only model, we identify which reactive features (that, in other RP languages are typically expressed"
