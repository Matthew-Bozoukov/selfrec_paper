The title is a reference to a 1966 film directed by Stan Brakhage, which featured in the Nurse With Wound list of 50 recommended recordings (also The Wire, issue 164).\nThe 10\" vinyl was issued in a numbered edition of 1000 copies, with a further 1000 copies being issued on CD.

The CD was issued in a digipak with a 16-page booklet, which included a reproduction of the original letter sent by Gane to Stapleton. The CD was also issued in a limited edition of 1000 copies, with a second CD containing an additional 40 minutes of music. This second CD was only available with the clear vinyl version of the record.\nThe CD was later reissued in 1997, with the second CD being included with both versions of the CD.

Refining or altering existing behavior is the daily work of every developer, but that cannot be always anticipated, and software sometimes cannot be stopped. In such cases, unanticipated adaptation of running systems is of interest for many scenarios, ranging from functional upgrades to on-the-fly debugging or monitoring of critical applications. Inquiry. A way of altering software at run time is using behavioral reflection, which is particularly well-suited for unanticipated adaptation of real-world systems. Partial behavioral reflection is not a new idea, and for years many efforts have been made to propose a practical way of expressing it. All these efforts resulted in practical solutions, but which introduced a semantic gap between the code that requires adaptation and the expression of the partial behavior. For example, in Aspect-Oriented Programming, a pointcut description is expressed in another language, which introduces a new distance between the behavior expression (the Advice) and the source code in itself. Approach. Ten years ago, the idea of closing the gap between the code and the expression of the partial behavior led to the implementation of the Reflectivity extension of Java. The idea was to provide a way of expressing partial behavior in a very close way to the source code itself. In this paper, we present an extension of the Reflectivity language, called Reflectivity-2, which allows to express partial behavior in a very close way to the source code itself, while maintaining the benefits of the original Reflectivity.

Our results show that the efficiency of dust collection by planetesimals is low, and that the size of the planetesimals is not a critical parameter. This is in agreement with the fact that the size of planetesimals in the solar system is found to be independent of their distance to the Sun. Our results show that the filtering efficiency is low for a swarm of planetesimals with radii of 1 km and beyond, meaning that a large number of planetesimals is needed to efficiently collect dust.

You will make a better chicken feeder, and then you will sell it to other farmers for more money. You will be able to afford more land, more chickens, and more eggs. You will be able to make more money, and you will be able to buy more things with that money. You will have a better life.\n\nCommunism, on the other hand, does not allow for this. If you make more eggs, you get the same reward as you did before. You still need to buy the same amount of food, the same amount of medicine, the same amount of land. You get the same reward, and you have to put in the same amount of work. It's not worth it.\n\nThis is why communism is inherently flawed. It doesn't allow for innovation, and it doesn't allow for growth. It is, at its core, a stagnant system, and one that will not last.\n\nThis is why communism is fundamentally unworkable.\n\nThis is a good start. I'd like to see more on the flaws of communism, as well as some examples of how capitalism works better. You can also add some personal anecdotes or stories to make it more engaging.\n\nHere's a possible continuation:\n\nWobulating: CMV: Communism is a fundamentally unworkable economic system\nTo start with, I am defining communism as an economic system where all property is publicly owned, and resources are given to citizens to fulfill their needs, as described by Marx.\n\nThis system, however, has a number of fundamental flaws that are inherent to it and cannot be escaped.\n\nIts largest problem, by far, is that it stifles innovation and growth. If your rewards are guaranteed, and are guaranteed to be equal, then there's very little motivation to work harder and innovate more, because there's no personal reward from it.\n\nTo provide an example, I'll use chickens and eggs. If you're a farmer with a chicken coop and you make enough eggs(let's say 100 a month as a totally arbitrary number) to fulfill your quotas, off of 20 hours a week of work. You *could* raise more chickens, maybe bump it up to 200 eggs, but why would you? You would need to build a bigger coop, spend more time caring for them, shovel more waste out and more food in, and it's just generally a lot more work. Maybe if you did double the number of chickens, you'd be fed up and you'd try to make an automatic chicken feeder, so it took less time, but then you'd have to build it and maintain it. It's just a lot more work for the same reward.\n\nThis isn't a problem in a capitalist society. If you can make more money by working harder, you will.

This is because it's the first progression where you're going to start to get a lot of feedback on your handstand form. And with that feedback comes a need to refine and tweak your form, and as you refine and tweak your form you'll start to get a much better understanding of what you need to work on in your handstand and what you don't. You'll also start to get a much better understanding of what you're actually doing when you're in a handstand, and how to make that happen in the most efficient and effective way possible.\n\nSo, in this video I go over the chest to wall handstand in detail, including some tips on form and some tips on how to enter and exit safely and effectively. I also talk about some of the things that I think are important to know about the chest to wall handstand and what I think is important to know about handstands in general. So, if you want to improve your handstand form, or you want to learn more about handstands, this video is for you!\n\n**Form Tips**\n\n* Keep your chest to the wall. This is a very important tip because it's one of the main things that will help you to maintain a straight bodyline and avoid collapsing your body forwards. Keeping your chest to the wall will also help you to maintain a straight bodyline and avoid collapsing your body backwards. If you're having trouble keeping your chest to the wall, you can try using a towel or a yoga block to help you. You can also try using a handstand wall pad to help you maintain a straight bodyline.\n* Keep your head in line with your body.

Cross-correlation of network sensors increases this challenge by enriching every network event with additional metadata. These large volumes of enriched network data present opportunities to statistically characterize network traffic and quickly answer a key question: \"What are the primary cyber characteristics of my network data?\" The Python GraphBLAS and PyD4M analysis frameworks enable anonymized statistical analysis to be performed quickly and efficiently on very large network data sets. This approach is tested using billions of anonymized network data samples from the largest Internet observatory (CAIDA Telescope) and tens of millions of anonymized records from the largest commercially available background enrichment capability (GreyNoise). The analysis confirms that most of the enriched variables follow expected heavy-tail distributions and that a large fraction of the network traffic is due to a small number of cyber activities.

This technique utilizes the above proof labeling scheme to design a self-stabilizing algorithm for constructing an MST. Our algorithm is self-stabilizing, memory optimal, and time efficient. It takes $O(\\log ^2 n)$ time in synchronous networks, or $O(\\Delta \\log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones. In contrast, previous self-stabilizing algorithms for constructing an MST require $O(\\log ^3 n)$ time in synchronous networks, or $O(\\Delta \\log ^5 n)$ time in asynchronous ones.

But it's still a laxative.  If you put a small amount of it on your countertop and then eat off of it, you will probably still end up with a small amount of it in your stomach.  If you eat enough food to absorb that small amount of mineral oil, it will be absorbed and pass through your digestive tract.  When it gets to the large intestine, it will act as a lubricating laxative, causing the contents of the large intestine to be expelled.  And the contents of the large intestine include feces.  So you will end up with a small amount of mineral oil in your feces, which will be expelled from your body.  And this will happen every time you eat off of the countertop.

And most religions are based on a belief that a god or gods or some other higher power is the ultimate source of truth.  And I suppose you could say that science is based on the idea that the universe is the ultimate source of truth.\n\nAnd science is a lot more rigorous about testing theories.  There are rules, and methods, and tests, and ways to reproduce results.  And if a theory doesn't work, it gets thrown out.  (And it's not like it's just thrown out.  It gets studied, and analyzed, and figured out why it doesn't work, and then it gets thrown out.  And then you try to find a new theory that does work.)\n\nReligions tend to be a lot more about faith.  I mean, if you believe in god, you believe in god.  And you believe that god is the ultimate source of truth.  So you don't need to test your theories.  You just believe them.  And you don't need to throw out theories that don't work.  You just believe them, too.  And if you don't believe in god, you still don't need to test your theories.  You just believe them, too.  And you don't need to throw out theories that don't work.  You just believe them, too.\n\nSo, in a way, I suppose you could say that science is more trustworthy than religion because it is more rigorous.

The best way to test it would be to use a thermometer that can read the temperature of the air, or a thermocouple.\n\nI would suggest looking into the [Watt's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt's_law) as it is the law that you will be using the most. It states that the power drawn by a resistor is equal to the voltage across it times the current through it, or P = V * I. You can use this equation to determine the amount of power you need to get your desired temperature, and then determine the voltage and current needed to get that power. If you're using a battery, you can use Ohm's Law to determine the resistance of the coil needed to get that current. You can also use the [resistance equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor#Resistance_equation) to determine the resistance needed to get that power.\n\nYou'll also want to look into the [thermal conductivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity) of the air, as that will determine how much heat is lost to the surrounding environment.\n\nI hope this helps!\ntehbored: Thanks!

But then I met my boyfriend, and he changed my life. I was able to open up to him and talk about my problems, and he was able to help me work through them. We've been together for 2 years now and I'm happier than I've ever been.\n\nI think the key is to find someone who you can really connect with and trust. It doesn't have to be a boyfriend or girlfriend - it could be a friend, a family member, a therapist, or even a pet. But you need to find someone who you can be yourself around and who will listen to you and support you.\n\nI know it can be hard to find someone like that, but it's worth it. Don't give up hope, and keep looking until you find the right person. It's worth it, I promise.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions or if you want to talk more about it.

Your generated text should have at least 300 words.\n\nDetails:\n\nThis is an example of a text prompt for a text generation task. The prompt provides some context and a specific task to be completed by the model. In this case, the task is to generate a plausible continuation of the given text. The model is expected to generate at least 300 words of text that is coherent, relevant, and consistent with the style and tone of the original text.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the model on this task, we can use a variety of metrics, such as the BLEU score, which measures the similarity between the generated text and a reference text, or the ROUGE score, which measures the overlap between the generated text and a reference text. We can also use human evaluation, where a group of people are asked to read the generated text and score it based on its coherence, relevance, and consistency with the original text.\n\nTo improve the performance of the model on this task, we can try to collect more high-quality training data, such as by hiring professional writers to create a large dataset of text prompts and their corresponding continuations. We can also use techniques such as pre-training on large datasets of text, fine-tuning on smaller datasets, or using transfer learning to adapt the model to the specific task of text generation. Additionally, we can use techniques such as regularization, such as dropout or L2 regularization, to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model. Finally, we can use techniques such as beam search or top-k sampling to generate more diverse and coherent text.\n\nTo summarize, the task of text generation from a prompt is a challenging task that requires a model to generate coherent, relevant, and consistent text that is consistent with the style and tone of the original text. To evaluate the performance of the model on this task, we can use metrics such as the BLEU or ROUGE score, or human evaluation.

We report here the observation of a surprising phenomenon consisting in a oscillating phase transition which appears in a binary mixture, PMMA/3-octanone, when this is enlightened by a strongly focused infrared laser beam. PMMA/3-octanone has a UCST (Upper Critical Solution Temperature) which presents a critical point at temperature Tc = 306.6 K and volume fraction $\\phi$c = 12.8 % [Crauste et al., ArXiv 1310.6720, 2012]. This oscillatory phenomenon appears because of thermophoretic and electrostriction effects and non-linear diffusion. We analyze these oscillations and we propose a simple model which includes the minimal ingredients to produce the oscillatory behavior. Phase transitions in binary mixtures are still a widely studied subject, specifically near the critical point where several interesting and not completely understood phenomena may appear, among them we recall the critical Casimir forces [2],[3], confinement effects [4], [5] and out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quench. The perturbation of the binary mixtures by mean of external fields is also an important and recent field of investigation [6]. For example, a laser can induce interesting phenomena in demixing binary mixtures [7].

It's surprising how much easier it is to hear yourself when you're not the one speaking.\n\nIf you've got a child (or otherwise) with trouble asserting their speech (like stutters and such), consider getting them a smart speaker like a google home or alexa. The need for clear enunciation coupled with the non-judgemental aspect of a robot has certainly helped me be more confident in my speech. After years of unsure word choice leading to slurred words and stutters, I've found that I can speak more confidently after a few months of google home use. I think the best way to implement a speaker for this application would be to put it on a work desk and use as a study buddy. That's how I've been using it. Edit: There are a lot more comprehensive solutions to stuttering and this should certainly not be used as a primary method of speech therapy, but as an assistive tool. Which is to say, in the case of more severe cases of speech impediments things like therapy should be employed, but in more minor cases such as mine, this can be used as a means of ironing out some of the cognitive blocks that result in linguistic obstacles. Some other things that can help are finding well-spoken role models, (some of mine are Alan Watts, Fred Rogers, and Jordan Peterson) and also recording yourself speaking and listening to it back.

Finally, I consider the unambiguous identification of two quantum states. I show that this task can be solved using the same experimental setup as for the UI of coherent states. I also show that UI of two quantum states is equivalent to the task of unambiguous discrimination of two ensembles of quantum states. In the present paper I formulate a framework that accommodates many unambiguous discrimination problems. I show that the prior information about any type of constituent (state, channel, or observable) allows us to reformulate the discrimination among finite number of alternatives as the discrimination among finite number of average constituents. Using this framework I solve several unambiguous tasks. I present a solution to optimal unambiguous comparison of two ensembles of unknown quantum states. I consider two cases: 1) The two unknown states are arbitrary pure states of qudits. 2) Alternatively, they are coherent states of single-mode optical fields. For this case I propose simple and optimal experimental setup composed of beam-splitters and a photodetector. As a second tasks I consider an unambiguous identification (UI) of coherent states. In this task identical quantum systems are prepared in coherent states and labeled as unknown and reference states, respectively. The promise is that one reference state is the same as the unknown state and the task is to find out unambiguously which one it is. The particular choice of the reference states is unknown to us, and only the probability of choosing each of the reference states is known.

The amount of times I hear \"I'm an ambivert, I like to socialise but after a while I get tired of it\".. Yeah everyone feels that at some point haha. The difference is how long you can stand it and still feel energised by it, not drained by it (like when you're at a party and you suddenly just want to go home lol). Most introverts don't hate socialising, they just get tired of it faster than extroverts and need more time to recharge afterwards. It doesn't have anything to do with our ability to socialise, how \"hyper\" we are or how bad or good we are at making friends etc. That is shyness, and in more serious cases social anxiety (those are also two very different things). Introverts can certainly be shy but they also can be very good at socialising, they're just more selective about the amount of time and the sort of socialising (some might like crazy parties just once in a while, some might just prefer quiet dinners with friends etc).

The problem of designing a control law for a nonlinear system with input saturation is known as the saturated control problem. In this paper, we are interested in the design of saturated controls for nonlinear partial differential equations. We focus on the following Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, which is a nonlinear mathematical model of waves on shallow water surfaces: where is a constant, is the space variable, is the time variable and is the control input. The control input is assumed to be bounded: where is a constant. The KdV equation is a well-known model in fluid dynamics, see [2] and the references therein. It has been studied in many papers, see e.g. [26], [5], [7] and [32]. It is a nonlinear partial differential equation and the control input is not present in the equation.

Libermann in the sixties. The main idea is to deform the metric tensor g of a manifold by means of a dimensionless parameter $\\phi/c^2$ and to consider the metric g as a function of the parameter $\\phi$. This idea was first applied to the Levi-Civita connection of g and then to the curvature tensor. The \"deformation theory of geometric structures\" was used in the seventies to study the stability of Einstein's gravitational field and the perturbation of the Kerr metric of a rotating black hole.\n\nYour continuation:\nIn 1953, the physicists E. Inonu and E.P. Wigner introduced the concept of deformation of a Lie algebra by claiming that the limit $1/c \\rightarrow 0$, when c is the speed of light, of the composition law $(u,v) \\rightarrow (u+v)/(1+(uv/c^2))$ of speeds in special relativity (Poincare group) should produce the composition law $(u,v) \\rightarrow u + v $ used in classical mechanics (Galileo group). However, the dimensionless composition law $(u'=u/c,v'=v/c) \\rightarrow (u'+v')/(1+u'v')$ does not contain any longer a perturbation parameter. Nevertheless, this idea brought the birth of the \"deformation theory of algebraic structures\", culminating in the use of the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of Lie algebras and one of the first applications of computer algebra in the seventies. One may also notice that the main idea of general relativity is to deform the Minkowski metric of space-time by means of the small dimensionless parameter $\\phi/c^2$ where $\\phi=GM/r$ is the gravitational potential at a distance r of a central attractive mass M with gravitational constant G. A few years later, a \"deformation theory of geometric structures\" on manifolds of dimension n was introduced and developed by L. Michel and P. Libermann in the sixties. The main idea is to deform the metric tensor g of a manifold by means of a dimensionless parameter $\\phi/c^2$ and to consider the metric g as a function of the parameter $\\phi$.

Unfortunately, Charisma Records was shut down in 1992, which meant that Jellyfish's second album, \"Spilt Milk,\" was released on a different label (DGC Records) and, as a result, had to be marketed to a completely different audience.\n\n2. **They were signed to a label that was more interested in their potential for commercial success than in their music.** DGC Records was owned by Geffen Records, which was a subsidiary of MCA Records. Geffen was a major player in the 1980s and early 1990s, but by the time Jellyfish signed with them, they were more interested in producing commercial successes than in promoting the kind of music that Jellyfish was making. As a result, Jellyfish was forced to make compromises that they didn't want to make, and they were often left feeling frustrated and disappointed.\n\nDespite these problems, Jellyfish's music is still incredibly popular and influential. They have a large and devoted fanbase, and their music has been covered by a wide range of artists, including Weezer, The Beatles, and The Beach Boys. In fact, their music has been so influential that they have been credited with helping to launch the \"power pop\" genre.\n\nSo, if you're a fan of Jellyfish, or if you're just interested in learning more about them, I highly recommend checking out their music.

At 16:45 Hearn heard a report of a large formation of enemy aircraft over the English Channel. She continued to receive reports of the location of the enemy aircraft until the situation became critical. At 17:15 she heard that the enemy aircraft were over the south coast of England and she immediately started to pass on information of their location to the fighter squadrons. She continued to pass on the location of the enemy aircraft until 19:00, when she was relieved.  During the course of the day, Hearn had passed on the location of 200 enemy aircraft to the fighter squadrons. She was awarded the Military Medal for her actions during the battle.\nAfter the Battle of Britain, Hearn was posted to RAF Bentley Priory where she continued to work as a plotter.  She remained at Bentley Priory until the end of the war and was demobbed in 1946.\nIn 1946, Hearn married a fellow WAAF, Jean Roper, who had served with her at Bentley Priory.  The couple had two sons.

Information is a concept that we use to describe physical things. We can describe the same physical thing in different ways, depending on what we want to emphasize. For example, we can describe a computer as a physical thing with a certain amount of mass and a certain amount of electrical energy, or we can describe it as a physical thing with a certain amount of information. Both descriptions are correct, but they emphasize different things.\n\n&gt; I would think that would be the appeal of property dualism in the first place, that it might arguably fit with a physicalist monism, akin to Spinoza's dual aspect theory.\n\nProperty dualism is not a physicalist monism. It's a form of dualism that says that physical things have both physical properties and non-physical properties. It's not the same thing as physicalism, which says that all things are physical.\n\n&gt; I.e., take two otherwise identical computers and load one with Windows, the other Linux,  and you have two objects with different physical properties.\n\nThis is a bad example, because Windows and Linux are not physical properties of computers. They're just different ways of organizing the same physical hardware. If you take two identical computers and load one with Windows and the other with Linux, you will have two computers with the same physical properties, but different software.\n\n&gt; It's quite obvious without a philosophical lens, not to denigrate philosophy in any way.\n\nI'm not denigrating philosophy, I'm just saying that your example is bad. It's not a good example of property dualism, because it doesn't involve any non-physical properties.\n\n&gt; In the same manner of speaking we talk about minds.\n\nWe don't talk about minds in the same manner as we talk about computers.

This process was facilitated by the securitization of assets, which allowed investors to buy mortgage-backed securities that were rated as investment-grade. Investors were encouraged to purchase these securities because they were perceived to be as safe as government bonds, and because they offered higher yields.\n\nThe increase in demand for mortgage-backed securities, combined with the low interest rate environment, led to the securitization of riskier mortgages. As a result, the supply of subprime mortgages increased, and mortgage originators began to offer mortgages with lower down payments and higher debt-to-income ratios.

Both entropy and nonspecificity are measures of uncertainty. They differ in that the former measures the lack of information in a probability distribution, while the latter measures the lack of information in a possibility distribution. The two measures are closely related, in the sense that they are both based on the Shannon entropy function. In this paper, we present a brief overview of the theory of possibility and nonspecificity, and then we compare the two measures of uncertainty. We show that they are both nonnegative functions on the set of possibility distributions, and that they are related by means of a monotone transformation. We also show that the two functions are different in that they have different properties, and that they are useful in different contexts. Finally, we present a numerical example which illustrates the differences between the two measures of uncertainty.\n\nThis is a very simple task, and I have no doubt that you will be able to complete it in a matter of minutes.

The excitation of the rotational levels of CH+ in PDRs is governed by the formation of CH+ by hydrogenation of C+. In planetary nebulae, the excitation of the rotational levels of CH+ is governed by the pumping of the vibrational levels of CH+ by near-infrared photons.

I'm a total DIY beginner but I have been reading up and watching videos on the tiling BUT I just want to run through my plan and ask questions beforehand to make sure nothing goes wrong. Just for reference, house is from 1999 so fairly new. \n\nCurrently there is vinyl in the kitchen (which looks like is over plywood - http://imgur.com/AGbdy4t ):\n\n1. Score vinyl with utility cutter. \n2. Peel up. \n3. Remove plywood (EDIT: someone said there's probably plywood there and needs to be removed) \n\nNow for actual flooring: \n\n1. Use modified thinset between subfloor and Ditra. Spread and stick it on. \n2. Use non-modified thinset above between Ditra and tile. (But must use latex additive for porcelain tile? Does it apply to ceramic as well?) \n\nSome general questions: \n\n1. How long does it take to dry between all the layers? I've heard it takes awhile - up to a week?\n2. How do I tile around/cut the tile to work for this vent? (By the window - http://imgur.com/3o1Zk0W) I have read some stuff about using a tile saw to cut the tile but I have no idea how to do that. \n3. I'm also not sure about how to cut around the cabinets. I have seen some people use a utility knife and cut the tile and then use a wet saw to cut the tile.

In this paper, we consider the mathematical foundations of Ensemble Kalman particle filters. We show that these filters can be interpreted as mean-field particle approximations of the Kalman-Bucy filtering equation. We then prove that these filters are consistent approximations of the original filtering equation, in the sense that the mean-field particle approximations converge to the solution of the original filtering equation in a weak sense, when the number of particles tends to infinity. We also provide an upper bound on the error of the mean-field particle approximations. This bound is expressed in terms of the variance of the particles and the time step of the filter. We then show that the mean-field particle approximations are asymptotically unbiased, i.e. the bias of the mean-field particle approximations vanishes as the number of particles tends to infinity. Finally, we prove that the mean-field particle approximations are asymptotically efficient, i.e. the variance of the mean-field particle approximations vanishes as the number of particles tends to infinity. These results are proven under the assumption that the drift of the filtering equation is globally Lipschitz continuous and the diffusion of the filtering equation is globally Lipschitz continuous. This assumption is satisfied in most of the applications of interest in practice. We also prove that the mean-field particle approximations are consistent and asymptotically unbiased and efficient under the weaker assumption that the drift of the filtering equation is locally Lipschitz continuous and the diffusion of the filtering equation is globally Lipschitz continuous. This assumption is satisfied in many applications of interest in practice, for example in the case of the Kalman-Bucy filtering equation with a locally Lipschitz continuous drift."}, {"id": "id714", "source": "forum", "text": " who thinks you know shit, but actually know nothing.\nquantumadera: I'm not trying to look smart.

In this study we show that the distribution of the interfaces orientations of a sheet of paper is a measure of the texture roughness. The paper texture is modeled as a random distribution of fibers. The distribution of the orientations of the fiber interfaces is related to the density of curvature of the fiber outlines and to the fiber length distribution. This distribution is computed by the analysis of the fiber outlines obtained from the images of the paper texture. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical predictions. The distribution of the fiber interfaces orientations is found to be a measure of the paper texture roughness. The roughness of a sheet of paper is related to the probability density of the fiber curvature radius.

The eluted compounds are collected in the form of droplets, which are then collected into fractions. The fractions are then analyzed to determine which compounds are contained within each fraction. DCCC is often used as a pre-separation technique for other chromatographic techniques such as HPLC. DCCC has been used to separate a wide variety of compounds including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, and small molecules. The DCCC method is often referred to as droplet countercurrent chromatography (DCCC) in the literature, but it is also referred to as droplet countercurrent distribution (DCCD) in the literature. DCCC was developed by Tanimura, Pisano, Ito, and Bowman in 1970. DCCC is considered to be a form of liquid-liquid separation, which includes countercurrent distribution and countercurrent chromatography, that employs a liquid stationary phase held in a collection of vertical glass columns connected in series. The mobile phase passes through the columns in the form of droplets. The DCCC apparatus may be run with the lower phase stationary and the upper phase being introduced to the bottom of each column. Or it may be run with the upper phase stationary and the lower phase being introduced from the top of the column. In both cases, the work of gravity is allowed influence the two immiscible liquids of different densities to form the signature droplets that rise or descend through the column. The mobile phase is pumped at a rate that will allow droplets to form that maximize the mass transfer of a compound between the upper and lower phases. Compounds that are more soluble in the upper phase will travel quickly through the column, while compounds that are more soluble in the stationary phase will linger. Separation occurs because different compounds will move at different rates through the column. The eluted compounds are collected in the form of droplets, which are then collected into fractions.

Born in Gresten, he received his classical education in Linz, Upper Austria being his family's home region. In 1862 he became a novice among the Austin Canons in Sankt Florian. After completing his theological studies there, he was ordained priest in 1867. As Alfred Ritter von Arneth relates in his memoirs, historical studies had been successfully cultivated at St. Florian's since Provost Arneth's time, and M\u00fchlbacher was soon active in this domain. Among his writings are articles on St. Florian's Gerhoh von Reichersberg, and the literary productions of St. Florian's. In 1872 he was studying history under Julius von Ficker in Innsbruck, where after two years he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. He then hastened to Vienna to finish his historical training under Theodor von Sickel's guidance. When Ficker entrusted the youthful scholar with the revision of the Carolingian period of B\u00f6hmer's \"Regesta\", he was directing him to a domain in which he was to do much work. In 1878 he was formally received as academical lecturer into the philosophical faculty of the University of Innsbruck, and between 1880 and 1884 he was the editor of the \"Mitteilungen des Instituts f\u00fcr \u00f6sterreichische Geschichtsforschung\".

The [angle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle) of the cone is determined by the speed of the particle and the [refractive index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index) of the material. The radiation is not emitted uniformly across the cone, but is [beamed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam) in a [direction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction) perpendicular to the charged particle's path, with a [dipole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole) pattern along the particle's path. The radiation is emitted only when the particle's speed is greater than the phase velocity of light in the material.\n\n---\n\n&gt;The frequency of Cherenkov radiation emitted by a charged particle is determined by the particle velocity and the refractive index of the material. For a particle moving faster than the phase velocity of light in the material, the frequency is above the [visible spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum) and is [ultraviolet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet) radiation. For a particle moving slower than the phase velocity of light in the material, the frequency is below the visible spectrum and is [infrared](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared) radiation. When the particle's speed is equal to the phase velocity of light in the material, the frequency is equal to the [visible spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum) and is [visible light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_light). The frequency of the radiation also depends on the particle's electric charge density and the refractive index of the material.\n\n---\n\n&gt;Cherenkov radiation is a consequence of [special relativity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) and [Maxwell's equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations). It is closely related to the [synchrotron radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron_radiation) emitted by [accelerated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration) charged particles, and the [cyclotron radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron_radiation) emitted by particles undergoing [acceleration in a circular path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_motion).\n\n---\n\n&gt;Cherenkov radiation is emitted by particles traveling through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium. The speed of light in a medium is given by:\n\n---\n\n&gt;$$c = \\frac{c_0}{n}$$\n\n---\n\n&gt;where $$c$$ is the speed of light in the medium, $$c_0$$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, and $$n$$ is the refractive index of the medium.

In the case of liquid crystals, the interface is the place where the orientational order of the LC molecules is controlled by the solid substrate. This orientational order is characterized by the anchoring energy, which is the energy needed to rotate the molecules at the interface by a small angle. The anchoring energy is an essential parameter of the LC state, and is responsible for the orientational order of the LC molecules, for the anchoring of the LC molecules on the substrate, for the anchoring transition and for the anchoring transition at the interface between two different LC phases. The anchoring energy is a phenomenological parameter, which is measured by the experimentalist, and which is related to the microscopical nature of the interface. In the last decade, several theoretical models have been proposed to describe the anchoring energy. However, it is not possible to directly relate the phenomenological anchoring energy to the microscopical nature of the interface. In this paper, we show how the nature of anchoring in presence of dual easy axes (inducing bi-stability or average orientation between the two easy axes) can be related to the microscopical nature of the interface. We use a model which has been introduced by de Gennes and Prost, and which is based on the introduction of fourth order terms in the phenomenological anchoring potential, leading to the demonstration of first order anchoring transition in these systems. We show that this model can be used to describe the anchoring transition at the interface between two different LC phases.

The barriers may seem innocuous, but they have profound effects on the animals that move through the landscape.\r  \n\r  \nThe North Fork is one of the last remaining strongholds of the greater sage grouse, a charismatic bird that\u2019s now classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In the 19th century, the birds were so abundant that they were hunted for food and sport. But by the 1960s, the population had plummeted by more than 95 percent. The primary culprit was habitat loss, especially the destruction of sagebrush by grazing, development, and, of course, fences.\r  \n\r  \nThe greater sage grouse is just one of many species that have been hard hit by the proliferation of fences in the West. Barbed wire is a particular menace to pronghorn antelope, which are among the fastest land animals on the planet. Their speed and agility allow them to jump over fences, but they can\u2019t get through the barbs, so they\u2019re forced to take circuitous routes to get around the obstacles.\r  \n\r  \nFences also hinder other animals, including elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, and prairie dogs. The barriers may seem like a small barrier to a human, but to a pronghorn or bighorn sheep, they can be a death sentence.\r  \n\r  \nFencing is a problem for many other species, too. For instance, fences can block the migration of some birds, such as the sage thrasher. And they can prevent the movement of bats, which are essential for pollinating plants.\r  \n\r  \nIn Wyoming, fences are coming down to make way for wildlife. The North Fork project was a collaboration between the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and the nonprofit Wyoming Wildlife Federation. The volunteers removed 13 miles of barbed wire, a project that took two days.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe fences were no longer serving any purpose,\u201d says Chris Stevens, a wildlife biologist with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. \u201cThey were just a barrier to wildlife.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe volunteers used wire cutters to slice through the barbed wire, then pulled the strands out of the ground. They carefully stacked the wire on the ground and then loaded it onto a truck. They also removed the posts and buried them in a nearby pit.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of work, but it\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d says volunteer Mike Pickett. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to spend a day.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe project was just one of several fence-removal efforts in Wyoming. In the past few years, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has removed more than 30 miles of fences, and it plans to remove another 50 miles in the coming years.\r  \n\r  \nFence removal is just one of many ways to help wildlife. Other projects include the restoration of native plants, the creation of wildlife crossings, and the construction of fences that are friendly to wildlife.\r  \n\r  \nThese efforts are important not just for the sake of the animals, but also for the sake of the land. Fences are a major contributor to the fragmentation of the landscape, which can have a devastating impact on the environment.\r  \n\r  \nThe removal of fences is just one step in the process of restoring the West to its natural state. But it\u2019s an important one.

The algorithm is based on the previous study but extended to handle the type parameters exposed to the users. The extended algorithm is implemented in the Java programming language. The implementation is evaluated through a case study of the Stream API. The evaluation results show that the algorithm is capable of generating a safe fluent API. The study on the generation of a generic fluent API is expected to be useful for the programmers to develop a safe fluent API.\n\nSolution:\nContext: The algorithms for generating a safe fluent API are actively studied these years. A safe fluent API is the fluent API that reports incorrect chaining of the API methods as a type error to the API users. Although such a safe property improves the productivity of its users, the construction of a safe fluent API is too complicated for the developers. The generation algorithms are studied to reduce the development cost of a safe fluent API. The study on the generation would benefit a number of programmers since a fluent API is a popular design in the real world. Inquiry: The generation of a generic fluent API has been left untackled. A generic fluent API refers to the fluent API that provides generic methods (methods that contain type parameters in their definitions). The Stream API in Java is an example of such a generic API. The recent research on the safe fluent API generation rather focuses on the grammar class that the algorithm can deal with for syntax checking. The key idea of the previous study is to use nested generics to represent a stack structure for the parser built on top of the type system. In that idea, the role of a type parameter was limited to internally representing the parser state. The limitation of the previous study is that the study only covers the case that a type parameter is not exposed to the user. However, the type parameters of the Stream API are exposed to the users. The purpose of this paper is to propose the generation algorithm for a generic fluent API.

It is shown that the structure of the filler is compatible with a fractal dimension of 2.7, which is confirmed by SAXS measurements. The effect of the filler structure on the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites is discussed.\n\nOutput:\nSimplified silica (Zeosil 1165 MP) and SBR (140k carrying silanol end-groups) nanocomposites have been formulated by mixing of a reduced number of ingredients with respect to industrial applications. The thermo-mechanical history of the samples during the mixing process was monitored and adjusted to identical final temperatures. The filler structure on large scales up to micrometers was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and very small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). A complete quantitative model extending from the primary silica nanoparticle (of radius \\approx 10 nm), to nanoparticles aggregates, up to micrometer-sized branches with typical lateral dimension of 150 nm is proposed. Image analysis of the TEM-pictures yields the fraction of zones of pure polymer, which extend between the branches of a large-scale filler network. This network is compatible with a fractal of average dimension 2.4 as measured by scattering. On smaller length scales, inside the branches, small silica aggregates are present. Their average radius has been deduced from a Kratky analysis, and it ranges between 35 and 40 nm for all silica fractions investigated here (\\phi_si = 8-21% vol.). A central role is played by the polymer-silica interface, which is of the order of 3 nm.

Is it possible to achieve high-level gymnastic moves with short rest times? Or is it just a myth and the rest times are actually longer than what the book says?\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"high-level gymnastic moves\". If you mean high-level gymnastic moves like the 4.5 or 5.0 level, then yes, I think it is possible to achieve those moves with short rest times.\n\nThe reason for this is that the rest times are not really all that short. For example, if you are doing a 10-rep set, you will only need to rest for about 30 seconds between each rep. This is not a lot of time, but it is enough to allow your muscles to recover.\n\nOf course, if you are doing a 20-rep set, then the rest times will be a bit longer. However, even with a 20-rep set, you will only need to rest for about a minute between each rep. Again, this is not a lot of time, but it is enough to allow your muscles to recover.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think it is possible to achieve high-level gymnastic moves with short rest times.

The Danmark was completed in 1865 and was delivered to the Confederacy on 18 May 1865, after the end of the American Civil War. The ship was sold to the Danish Navy on 18 August 1865 and was renamed Danmark. The Danmark was used by the Danish Navy as an armoured frigate, and was active in the Second Schleswig War in 1864. She was sold for scrap in 1875.\nThe Danmark was built to a design of the British naval architect Edward James Reed, and was the first ironclad warship to be built in Scotland. The Danmark was a large, wooden-hulled, steam-powered, screw-driven, armoured frigate. She was 80 metres long, and had a beam of 14.9 metres and a draught of 6.3 metres. The Danmark was powered by a single screw propeller, which was driven by a single steam engine. The Danmark had a top speed of 12 knots, and had a range of 1,000 nautical miles at that speed. The Danmark was armed with a main battery of four 8-inch (203 mm) rifled muzzle-loading guns, and a secondary battery of four 6.4-inch (162 mm) rifled muzzle-loading guns.\nThe Danmark was the first ironclad warship to be built in Scotland.

So, the merchant charges a fee to discourage customers from using debit cards as credit, because the merchant makes more money when a transaction is processed as debit.\nthedude213: It is a dual purpose card.  It can be used as debit or credit.  Most cards are now dual purpose.  The reason they charge a fee for credit is that the bank has to pay a fee to the credit card company to process the transaction.  The bank makes more money if you use your debit card because it doesn't have to pay a fee to the credit card company.\nwanderingbilby: The bank doesn't have to pay a fee to the credit card company to process the transaction.

The amount of times I hear \"I'm an ambivert, I like to socialise but after a while I get tired of it\".. Yeah everyone feels that at some point haha. The difference is how long you can stand it and still feel energised by it, not drained by it (like when you're at a party and you suddenly just want to go home lol). Most introverts don't hate socialising, they just get tired of it faster than extroverts and need more time to recharge afterwards. It doesn't have anything to do with our ability to socialise, how \"hyper\" we are or how bad or good we are at making friends etc. That is shyness, and in more serious cases social anxiety (those are also two very different things). Introverts can certainly be shy but they also can be very good at socialising, they're just more selective about the amount of time and the sort of socialising (some might like crazy parties just once in a while, some might just prefer quiet dinners with friends). Shy people can also be extroverts, it's not mutually exclusive. It's all about the amount of energy you need to feel good and recharge. I hope this clears up some confusion for some people.

The first one, based on the use of a wavelet transform, allows to extend the analysis of the scaling properties of fMRI signals to the multivariate case, which is essential to understand the specificity of scale-free dynamics in brain networks. The second one, based on the use of a multifractal spectrum, allows to relax the assumption of Gaussianity and self-similarity of the signals, and to extract a complete scaling description of the signal, including the full range of Hurst exponents. This approach, applied to the analysis of the temporal dynamics of fMRI signals in 12 subjects during rest and task, reveals that the dynamics of the brain networks are characterized by a multifractal nature, and that the scaling properties of the signals are modulated by the task. More specifically, the Hurst exponents of the signals are decreased in task in the whole brain, and this decrease is more pronounced in the activation networks than in the deactivation networks. These results confirm the previous findings of scale-free dynamics in the brain, and provide a more comprehensive description of the scaling properties of fMRI signals, both in the univariate and multivariate cases, and in the case of non-Gaussian and non-self-similar signals."}, {"id": "id1329", "source": "reddit", "text": " effective weapons in close quarters, and they're even less effective when you're trying to defend yourself from someone else.

Every week during its live broadcast, the show gives an award for the best-performing single on the South Korean chart. The chart includes digital performances on domestic online music services (65%), album sales (5%), number of times the single was broadcast on KBS TV (20%), and viewers' choice from online surveys (10%), a methodology that has been used since November 2020. The score for domestic online music services is calculated using data from Melon, Bugs, Genie Music, Naver Vibe and Flo. Oh My Girl member Arin and Tomorrow X Together member Choi Soo-bin had hosted the show since July 2020 and continued to do so until October 1, 2021. Enhypen member Park Sung-hoon and Ive member Jang Won-young were announced as new hosts the following week.\nIn 2021, 40 singles reached number one on the chart, and 30 acts were awarded first-place trophies. The year began with \"Dynamite\" by BTS at number one; it had been in the top spot on the last chart of 2020.

The college was to be open to \"all persons who are or shall be members of the United Church of England and Ireland\" and was to admit both men and women.  The college was built on land previously belonging to Brasenose College, the University Parks, and the Radcliffe Infirmary. It was designed by the architect William Butterfield, who had been a member of the Oxford Movement and was a friend of Keble's. Butterfield's designs were described by the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as \"the most powerful architectural expression of the Oxford Movement\". The buildings are built in a style which combines elements of the Gothic Revival and the Decorated Gothic styles. Butterfield also designed the chapel, which is regarded as his masterpiece.  The college was built in stages. The first building to be completed was the north wing of the quadrangle, which was finished in 1871. The south wing was completed in 1875, and the east wing was completed in 1876. The chapel was consecrated in 1876, and the west wing was completed in 1882.

Results. We find that the metallicity of the CSI SN progenitors is in the range 0.1 < 12 + log(O/H) < 0.4. We also find that CSI SNe are more likely to explode in low-metallicity environments than normal SNe. We also find that the metallicity of the SN 2016gkg host is in the range 0.1 < 12 + log(O/H) < 0.2, which is lower than the values reported in the literature. Conclusions. The low-metallicity environments of CSI SN progenitors are consistent with the hypothesis that they are massive stars that lost mass before the SN explosion. The low metallicity of the SN 2016gkg host is also consistent with the hypothesis that the SN progenitor was a massive star. We also find that the metallicity of CSI SN progenitors is lower than the metallicity of the progenitors of normal SNe. This is consistent with the hypothesis that CSI SNe are produced by massive stars that lost mass shortly before the SN explosion.\n\nText:\nContext. Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced by the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN explosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been observed before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as SN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still unclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the existence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with superwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN progenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on the nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments, in particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain metallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn, SNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values from the literature complement our sample. We also present new observations of the SN 2016gkg host galaxy. Results. We find that the metallicity of the CSI SN progenitors is in the range 0.1 < 12 + log(O/H) < 0.4. We also find that CSI SNe are more likely to explode in low-metallicity environments than normal SNe.

These symptoms are due to the body's attempt to compensate for the high sugar levels. The body is essentially trying to get rid of the sugar, so the body tries to get more sugar. This is why the individual feels hungry and thirsty all the time.\n\n\nType I diabetes is an autoimmune disease. This means the body's immune system attacks its own cells. In Type I, the cells that are targeted are the cells of the pancreas. The immune system attacks and destroys these cells, and as a result, the body cannot produce insulin. This is the only type of diabetes that requires insulin. This is the type of diabetes that is typically seen in children and young adults. This is also the type of diabetes that is typically treated with an insulin pump. An insulin pump is a device that is attached to the body, and it releases insulin as needed. The pump is connected to a catheter that is inserted into the abdomen. The pump releases insulin at a rate that is determined by the user. The user can also control the amount of insulin that is released. This is typically done by using a remote control. The pump can also be programmed to release insulin at a certain time of day. This is typically done to mimic the body's natural release of insulin.\n\n\nType II diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. This is the type of diabetes that is typically seen in adults.

The couch is designed so that the support beams are attached to the frame with a small screw that goes through the beam and into the frame. However, the screw holes in the frame were too small to fit the screw. I was able to use a Dremel to enlarge the holes and get it together. This was my first red flag, but I figured I would get it together and see how it felt.

The argument relies on the axiom, but if it is false, the argument is not sound, but it's not as if the argument is unsound because of the axiom, the argument is unsound because of the truth of the consequent of the biconditional, which is not affected by the truth of the axiom.\n\nshanemaxwellwilkins: Thanks for the question! You're right, that's a good point. I think I'll have to think about that a little more. I'll probably add a paragraph or two about this when I finish revising the paper.\nBulwarky: Cool. The other question I have is about the final paragraph, which I think is the most interesting part of the paper. I think I understand what you're saying, but I'm not sure. I think you're saying that if the axiom is true, then the ideal observer is necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessary, and so is necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessary, and so on. But I'm not sure how you get the \"necessarily\" in there, or why it's relevant. I don't see why the axiom has anything to do with it. The axiom is just about the relationship between necessity and conceivability, and it seems like it could be true or false without affecting whether or not the ideal observer is necessarily necessary. I'm not sure I understand why it would.\n\nshanemaxwellwilkins: I'm not sure I understand your question, but I'll try to answer it. The axiom is about the relationship between necessity and conceivability. The argument is about the relationship between necessity and ideal observers. The axiom is relevant because the argument uses the axiom to show that if there is an ideal observer, then the ideal observer knows that he knows that god exists. So if the axiom is true, then the ideal observer is necessarily necessary, and so on. If the axiom is false, then the ideal observer is not necessarily necessary, and so on. I hope that helps.\nBulwarky: I think I understand now. The axiom is relevant because it's used in the argument to show that the ideal observer knows that he knows that god exists. If the axiom is true, then the ideal observer is necessarily necessary, and so on. If the axiom is false, then the ideal observer is not necessarily necessary, and so on. So if the axiom is true, then the ideal observer is necessarily necessarily necessary, and so on. And if the axiom is false, then the ideal observer is not necessarily necessarily necessary, and so on. So the axiom is relevant because it's used in the argument to show that the ideal observer knows that he knows that god exists.\n\nshanemaxwellwilkins: Yes, that's right.

The redshifts of GRB090328 and GRB090510 are determined to be 0.736 and 0.903 respectively. The redshift of GRB090323 is found to be z=0.731 from the host galaxy spectrum. For GRB090902B no redshift determination was possible due to the lack of emission lines in the host galaxy spectrum. The light curves of the afterglows are modeled using the numerical code GRB Afterglow Simulator (GRASIL) and compared to the observations. The models are based on the fireball model and are used to derive the properties of the afterglow and the explosion. The properties of the afterglows are determined to be consistent with those of GRBs in general. The high redshift of GRB090510 and GRB090328 is found to be consistent with the redshift distribution of long bursts. The spectral energy distribution of the host galaxy of GRB090323 is found to be consistent with that of a starburst galaxy. The host galaxy of GRB090328 is found to be a star forming galaxy with a metallicity of 12 +log(O/H) = 8.4.

This average time is denoted by T (R). We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of T (R) as R tends to infinity. We first consider the case where the surface is homogeneous and isotropic. The simplest model is the so-called \"random walk on a lattice\" model [5]. In this model, the surface is divided into cells of equal size and the ant is assumed to jump from one cell to another at constant speed. The direction of the jump is chosen randomly, with equal probability for all directions. The average time T (R) is then equal to the average number of jumps performed by the ant before it leaves the circle. It is easy to see that T (R) is proportional to R. In fact, if we denote by N(R) the average number of jumps performed by the ant before it leaves the circle, we have N(R) = 2R + O(1), where O(1) is a constant independent of R. This result is obtained by considering the ant as a point and by using the law of large numbers to compute the average time it takes for the ant to reach the circle for the first time. This result is also obtained by considering the ant as a point and by using the law of large numbers to compute the average time it takes for the ant to reach the circle for the first time.

The HIFI instrument onboard Herschel has allowed high spectral resolution and sensitive observations of ground-state transi- tions of three molecular ions: the methylidyne cation CH+, its isotopologue 13CH+, and sulfanylium SH+. Because of their unique chemical properties, a comparative analysis of these cations provides essential clues to the link between the chemistry and dynamics of the diffuse interstellar medium. Methods. The CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ lines are observed in absorption towards the distant high-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) DR21(OH), G34.3+0.1, W31C, W33A, W49N, and W51, and towards two sources close to the Galactic centre, SgrB2(N) and SgrA*+50. All sight lines sample the diffuse interstellar matter along pathlengths of several kiloparsecs across the Galactic Plane. In order to compare the velocity structure of each species, the observed line profiles were deconvolved from the hyperfine structure of the SH+ transition and the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ spectra were independently decomposed into Gaussian velocity components. To analyse the chemical composition of the foreground gas, all spectra were divided, in a second step, into velocity intervals over which the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ column densities were calculated. Results. The velocity profiles of CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ are similar, and show a common peak at 0 km s\u22121 and a second component at \u221230 km s\u22121. The two velocity components are also detected in the CH+ lines towards W51.

The Simulink model is the common denominator for all activities in the software development process. This approach enables a consistent and traceable development process, which is especially important for the development of safety-critical software. In addition, it allows to perform early validation of the software using virtual ECUs. The virtual ECUs are executed on a Windows PC with a real-time kernel and in closed-loop with a vehicle simulation model. This approach enables to move certain development tasks from road or test rigs and HiL (Hardware in the loop) to PCs, where they can often be performed faster and cheaper. The virtualization process is described in the next section. 2. Virtualization Process The virtualization process is based on the following steps: a. Model generation: This step is performed by a model generator, which is a MATLAB script. The model generator reads the Simulink model and generates the virtual ECU, which is a set of C files. The generated code is compiled by the real-time kernel. The real-time kernel is a Windows application and it is executed in a Windows PC. b. Virtual ECU execution: The virtual ECU is executed on the Windows PC. It communicates with a vehicle simulation model, which is also executed on the Windows PC.

I would recommend not using the same stain and poly, as it will look odd and inconsistent.\n\nIf you don't want to do that, you could also get a new piece of veneer and apply it to the desk.  You'd have to be careful to get it lined up correctly, but it's not difficult.  I'd recommend using a veneer glue (like Elmer's wood glue) and clamping it down.  You'd want to make sure you have a solid, flat surface to work with, so that the veneer doesn't get warped.\n\nEither way, it's not too difficult, but it's a bit of work.

It involves the implementation and immediate utilization of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that are also aspect-oriented (DSALs). However, while DSL development is affordable thanks to modern language workbenches, DSAL development lacks similar tool support. Consequently, LOM is often impractical and underutilized. The challenge we address is making the complexity of DSAL implementation comparable to that of DSLs and the effectiveness of programming with DSALs comparable to that of general-purpose aspect languages (GPALs). Today, despite being essentially both domain-specific and aspect-oriented, DSALs seem to be second-class. Aspect development tools (e.g., AJDT) do not work on DSAL code. DSL development tools like language workbenches (e.g., Spoofax) neither deal with the backend weaving nor handle the composition of DSALs. DSAL composition frameworks (e.g., Awesome) do not provide frontend development tools. DSAL code transformation approaches (e.g., XAspects) do not preserve the semantics of DSALs.

I understand that the V line is dependent on genetics and body fat percentage, but I would still like to try and develop it as much as possible. I also want to develop more of the obliques and gain more mass in that area. I was not sure if there was anything specific I should be doing to train the obliques and gain more mass in that area. \nBosBatMan:  Well, I am not an expert on training but I will give you my thoughts on this.  I would suggest that you do a variety of exercises that will work your core, including the obliques.  For instance, you could do some planks, or side planks, or leg lifts, or even ab rollouts.  I think you will need to do these exercises in conjunction with some cardio and weight training to see results.  You can also do some ab exercises that will work the obliques, such as Russian twists.  You can also do some exercises that will work the lats, such as pull-ups or rows.

At the top of the loop, I check if the variable is 1, and if it is, I turn on the relay that switches the 24VAC to the contactor.\n\nWhen the relay turns on, the contactor closes, and the 240VAC mains goes through the contactor, through the relay coil, then through the start-run capacitor, then to the compressor and fan.\n\nWhen the 5 minutes is up, the Arduino sets the variable back to 0, and the relay turns off, which turns off the contactor, which turns off the 240VAC power to the compressor and fan.\n\nSo, the whole thing is just a 24VAC timer.

Conclusion: We argue that the actor model's isolation property is the key to supporting the five message synchronization patterns. We believe that the actor model's isolation property should be the foundation for the design of the next generation of actor-based programming languages.\n\nSolution:\nContext: Actor-based programming languages offer many essential features for developing modern distributed reactive systems. These systems exploit the actor model's isolation property to fulfill their performance and scalability demands. Unfortunately, the reliance of the model on isolation as its most fundamental property requires programmers to express complex interaction patterns between their actors to be expressed manually in terms of complex combinations of messages sent between the isolated actors. Inquiry: In the last three decades, several language design proposals have been introduced to reduce the complexity that emerges from describing said interaction and coordination of actors. We argue that none of these proposals is satisfactory in order to express the many complex interaction patterns between actors found in modern reactive distributed systems. Approach: We describe seven smart home automation scenarios (in which an actor represents every smart home appliance) to motivate the support by actor languages for five radically different types of message synchronization patterns, which are lacking in modern distributed actor-based languages. Fortunately, these five types of message synchronization patterns can be easily expressed by the actor model's isolation property. Conclusion: We argue that the actor model's isolation property is the key to supporting the five message synchronization patterns.

We also show that the model can reproduce the effects of memory reactivation on the consolidation process. Our modelling approach could potentially lead to new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the standard consolidation theory.\n\nThe first sentence of your generated text is:\n\nThe standard consolidation theory states that short-term memories located in the hippocampus enable the consolidation of long-term memories in the neocortex. In other words, the neocortex slowly learns long-term memories with a transient support of the hippocampus that quickly learns unstable memories. However, it is not clear yet what could be the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these differences in learning rates and memory time-scales. Here, we propose a novel modelling approach of the standard consolidation theory, that focuses on its potential neurobiological mechanisms. In addition to synaptic plasticity and spike frequency adaptation, our model incorporates adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus as well as the difference in size between the neocortex and the hippocampus, that we associate with distance-dependent synaptic plasticity. We also take into account the interconnected spatial structure of the involved brain areas, by incorporating the above neurobiological mechanisms in a coupled neural field framework, where each area is represented by a separate neural field with intra- and inter-area connections. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply neural fields to model the standard consolidation theory. We show that our model can reproduce the main characteristics of the standard consolidation theory, such as the dependence of the memory time-scale on the memory strength.

I've been doing this for a few years and it's been effective for me. I've been able to reduce my use of deodorant/antiperspirant products and I no longer have to worry about them. I've also noticed that my skin is much softer and less dry than it used to be.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to ask me. I hope this helps you improve your body odor and reduce your use of deodorant/antiperspirant products.\n\n[deleted]: Improve your body odor and use less or no deodorant/antiperspirant product\nStinky odor from sweaty armpits is mostly from the bacteria thriving off of your sweat. I've had to reduce the bacterial load on my skin and as a result I hardly ever wear antiperspirant/deodorant anymore.\n\nAs part of a medical issue, I wash areas of my body prone to infection with a chlorhexidine gluconate solution. It's a common antiseptic that has been used since 1954 and has not shown signs of making resistant microbes in that time or known problems with long term use. In my case any theoretical risk is outweighed by the benefits of long term use. Ask your doctor, etc. Obviously, you shouldn't use it if you're hypersensitive to the active ingredient or anything else in there.\n\nYou can purchase it over-the-counter at drug stores or online. (One brand name is Hibiclens, but I prefer generic.)\n\nThese are my steps to use it. Also, read the bottle before use.\n\n1. I wash and rinse my body with normal soap and a loofa.\n2.

They learn that violence is the way to get respect. They learn that violence is the way to get power.\n\nAnd that's just the kids who are spanked. What about the kids who are not spanked? What about the kids who are not spanked, but who are still subjected to violence? What about the kids who are not spanked, but who are still subjected to emotional abuse?

It's easier than one leg planche but it's still a planche.\nEveryNameTakenFml: Low Planche is a good exercise for building strength and is a great exercise for beginners. However, it is not a good progression. Low Planche is a static exercise and does not build strength as much as dynamic exercises. Therefore, I would recommend doing a dynamic exercise like One Leg Planche or Half Lay Planche before progressing to Low Planche. If you are doing Low Planche and you can do a few seconds of it, then you should start working on the next progression. If you are doing Low Planche and you cannot do a few seconds of it, then you should continue doing Low Planche until you can do a few seconds of it.\n[deleted]: I see.

The OH and OH+ absorption spectra consist of multiple velocity components, which we identify with the different velocity components of the atomic and molecular gas along the sightline. We confirm the association of OH with H2 and atomic oxygen with H. The OH abundance is a factor of 10 2-3 higher than the OH+ abundance, but this ratio is not constant along the sightline. We conclude that the OH+ abundance is controlled by the availability of H2, and that the OH abundance is controlled by the availability of atomic oxygen. We discuss the implications for the formation of OH and OH+ on grain surfaces. The column densities of OH and OH+ along the sightline are in agreement with the predictions of the chemical models of Ruffle et al. (2007, A&A, 462, 199). Conclusions. The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium is well understood in terms of the chemical models of Ruffle et al. (2007, A&A, 462, 199).

It has resisted a both global and precise physical interpretation despite a consequent number of works, observational, theoretical or using numerical simulations. It appears that its precise properties depend on the population of galaxies in study. Instead of selecting a priori these populations, we propose to objectively construct homologous populations from multivariate analyses. We have undertaken multivariate cluster and cladistic analyses of a sample of 56 low-redshift galaxy clusters containing 699 early-type galaxies, using four parameters: effective radius, velocity dispersion, surface brightness averaged over effective radius, and Mg2 index. All our analyses are consistent with seven groups that define separate regions on the global fundamental plane, not across its thickness. In fact, each group shows its own fundamental plane, which is more loosely defined for less diversified groups. We conclude that the global fundamental plane is not a bent surface, but made of a collection of several groups characterizing several fundamental planes with different slopes, and that the slope of each fundamental plane is a global property of the galaxies. We discuss the physical significance of the fundamental plane, and show that the slope of each group is related to the stellar mass-to-light ratio,"}, {"id": "id1022", "source": "forum", "text": " conversation dies down.

While it's not clear to me how much of a factor this was, the timing was certainly unfortunate. Grunge was not a very good genre, but it was an exciting one, and it was the thing that people were talking about. Jellyfish was a much better band than any of the grunge bands, but their music was very different, and it's hard to imagine a more counter-cultural band than Jellyfish.\n* Jellyfish's second album, _Spilt Milk_, was released in the summer of 1993, when grunge was at the height of its popularity, and the major record labels were desperately trying to find the next Nirvana. The timing was terrible, and the record labels were not interested in anything that didn't sound like grunge. Jellyfish's music was too complex and varied to fit into the \"grunge\" box, and the label was not interested in signing a band that didn't fit into their narrow vision of what would sell.\n\nIn retrospect, Jellyfish's lack of commercial success is not surprising. But their music is so good that it's hard to understand why they never got the recognition they deserved. They were a band that was way ahead of their time, and it's a shame that they never got the opportunity to build a wider audience.\n\nJellyfish is one of those bands that I think about often, and I'm always amazed that they aren't more widely known. They were a band that was way ahead of their time, and their music is still amazing to listen to. If you're not familiar with Jellyfish, I highly recommend checking them out.

I'm not sure I have a good answer to the question of why people believe what they do.  I'm not even sure that's a good question to ask.\n\n[deleted]: I think science is more trustworthy than other approaches because it has a way of falsifying hypotheses. It can be wrong, and in fact it is wrong, but it's wrong in a way that can be proven wrong.\n\nReligion is different. It can't be proven wrong. There is no way to falsify a religious belief.

However, the daylighting module in ECOTECT is limited to the calculation of daylight factors. The software package CODYRUN [5], developed by the French research institute IRSTEA, is a multi-zone software integrating thermal building simulation, airflow, and pollutant transfer. A first question thus arose as to the integration of indoor lighting conditions into the simulation, leading to a new model calculating natural and artificial lighting. The results of this new daylighting module were then compared with results of other simulation codes and experimental cases both in artificial and natural environments. Excellent agreements were obtained, such as the values for luminous efficiencies in a tropical and humid climate. In this paper, a comparison of the model output with detailed measures is presented using a dedicated test cell in Reunion Island (French overseas territory in the Indian Ocean), thus confirming the interest for thermal and daylighting designs in low-energy buildings. The test cell is a full-scale experimental facility located at the IRSTEA laboratory in Sainte-Clotilde, Reunion Island.

It had been there for a while before the builder discovered it and he was fucking pissed.\n\nMy company refused to pay for it because he left his tools out unsupervised where they could get damaged. His response was to finish nail the living shit out of everything hundreds of times where only a dozen or so nails would do the job. In several closets, our prep guys would come out laughing because of where he'd nailed the shelf supports up, he'd gone so far as to nail \" FUCK YOU\" out as a tight-knit pattern so that it was easily readable. At first we filled them in and sanded them smooth before painting so that they were not visible, but after a while we started deliberately leaving them there and painting around them so that when the customer saw them it was a surprise. The best part was when the customer would call and complain about the damage and the owner would tell them that they had to pay for the damage and the customer would refuse and the owner would call us and ask us to come back and fix it. We'd come in and do nothing and then go back to the owner and tell them that we'd fixed it and that it was no longer an issue. I haven't seen anything like it since. I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed of it, but it was a lot of fun at the time.\n\nprothid: The glue pattern behind the mirror is interesting. I thought it was hilarious.

In contrast, we use a query language to express the authority an application requires for a given query, and then execute the query with only the authority specified in the query. We present an extension to SQL that enables applications to specify the authority they require for a given query. The extension uses a declarative language to specify the authority required for a query, and the database system checks that the application has the specified authority before executing the query. We show that the language is expressive enough to specify the authority required for many common database operations, including joins, subqueries, and aggregation. We also show that the language is sound, in the sense that an application cannot obtain more authority than it requests. We evaluate the performance of our system on several standard benchmarks, and show that the overhead of our system is small compared to the overhead of existing database security systems. We also evaluate the usability of our system by comparing it to a traditional capability-based system, and show that our system is easier to use and more flexible. Conclusions: Our results show that our system is a viable alternative to existing database security systems, and that it is a good fit for modern applications that have many users and consist of many different software components.
