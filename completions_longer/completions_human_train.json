Reducing building energy consumption may be addressed by the physical modifications which can be operated on a building like upgrading windows, heating systems or modifying thermic characteristics by insulating. Another possible path to reduce the energy consumption of a building is to use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). According to the International Panel on Climate Change, a reduction of energy even greater than the 30% can be targeted by 2030 by considering ICT solutions.

So look in the blind spots, look at what Derrida is doing, more than the results that may or may not be coherently spit out at the end.\n\nOne last semi-tip: Paul de Man's essay in \"Blindness and Insight\" on Derrida's reading of Rousseau is an illuminating work of deconstruction in its own right, and for me it made the process of reading Derrida make a lot more sense (i.e. I knew what the hell I was doing when I was reading Derrida, which as I've implied here is more important than knowing what he is \"actually saying\")\n\nAlso, understanding Derrida to some degree is absolutely essential to grappling with most things that could rightly be called post-[put anything here].

Programmers can control a scope of instance operators by specifying where the dsl object is active. We extend the host type system so that it can express the activation of a dsl object. In our system, a bound name is propagated through a type parameter to a dsl object. This enables us to implement user-defined language constructs involving static name binding. A contribution of this paper is that we reveal we can integrate a system for managing names and their scopes with a module and type system of an object-oriented language like Java. This allows us to implement a proposed system by adopting eager disambiguation based on expected types so that the compilation time will be acceptable.

Using a post system was more forgiving than the joists because I could wiggle a post back and forth a bit within the block to get it in the right spot whereas the joists I could not, they would move the whole block.  \n\nThe deck block doesn't have to sit perfectly level if you are using posts. Pound it into place and then put the post in, and the post should have just enough wiggle room that you can level it separately. \nsoul_system: I was researching these 4x4 posts + blocks now. Do the posts just sit down into the blocks without any additional fasteners? Is that not insecure?\nSophieFrise: Yes, the 4x4 sit in the middle area and then you can bolt the frame to the post.

Interestingly, Cat and PEPut have distinct commitments in replication: while Cat impacts positively and negatively replication fork speed, PEPut stimulates initiation through a process depending on Cat-PEPut interaction and growth conditions. Residues binding to PEP and ADP in Cat, stabilizing the Cat-PEPut interaction and belonging to the TSH motif of PEPut were found important for the commitment of PykA in replication. In vitro , PykA affects the activities of replication enzymes (the polymerase DnaE, helicase DnaC and primase DnaG) essential for initiation and elongation and genetically linked to pykA . Our results thus connect replication initiation and elongation to CCM metabolites (PEP, ATP and ADP), critical Cat and PEPut residues and to multiple links between PykA and the replication enzymes DnaE, DnaC and DnaG. We propose that PykA is endowed with a moonlighting activity that senses the concentration of signaling metabolites and interacts with replication enzymes to convey information on the cellular metabolic state to the replication machinery and adjust replication initiation and elongation to metabolism"

This result has practical implications such as applicability of MECE to partial interior data (with important practical applications including ultrasound elastography), convergence of finite element discretizations and differentiability of the reduced MECE functional. In addition, we establish that usual least squares and pure ECE formulations are limiting cases of MECE formulations for small and large values of $\\kappa$, respectively.

If a child holds up 3 fingers and says \"five\", the reason we consider him wrong is not because \"three\" is a better word than \"five\" for the number of fingers he holds up, but because we mean he is not complying to our conventional labels for these numbers. Now it seems to me that if Scientists hold to Popper's demarcation of science vs non-science, then for better or worse, that is the conventional definition of Science. Thus perhaps the article should be called: \"A better approach to Demarcation\" or \"A better way to define Science\". Although in so doing, one is open to having to have some goals in mind as well as arguments as to how the new definition serves the goals better than the old.\nneerwil: I think your comment is mistaken in two areas: First, I think Popper was indeed motivated to advocate a certain approach to science, namely to use falsification to judge whether a certain claim is scientific"

If government didn't have the power to create laws and rules in favor of certain groups over another, there's no reason to buy them off.

The vast diversity of chemical pathways allows the independent determinations of free parameters never estimated before: an upper limit to the average turbulent dissipation rate, $\\overline{\\varepsilon}$ < 10$^{-23}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ for $n_H$=20 cm$^{-3}$, from the CH+ abundance; an upper limit to the ion-neutral velocity drift, $u_{in}$ < 3.5 km s$^{-1}$, from the SH+ to CH+ abundance ratio; and a range of dissipation timescales, 100 < $\\tau_V$ < 1000 yr, from the CO to HCO+ abundance ratio.

However, if the disk is weakly turbulent ($\\alpha=10^{-4}$) filtering becomes efficient in two regimes: (i) when planetesimals are all smaller than about 10 km in size, in which case collisions mostly take place in the geometric regime; and (ii) when planetary embryos larger than about 1000 km in size dominate the distribution, have a scale height smaller than one tenth of the gas scale height, and dust is of millimeter size or larger in which case most collisions take place in the settling regime. These two regimes have very different properties: we find that the local filtering efficiency $x_{filter,MMSN}$ scales with $r^{-7/4}$ (where $r$ is the orbital distance) in the geometric regime, but with $r^{-1/4}$ to $r^{1/4}$ in the settling regime. This implies that the filtering of dust by small planetesimals should occur close to the central star and with a short spread in orbital distances. On the other hand, the filtering by embryos in the settling regime is expected to be more gradual and determined by the extent of the disk of embryos. Dust particles much smaller than millimeter"

Another property is that if $f$ faults occurred, then, within the requireddetection time above, they are detected by some node in the $O(f\\log n)$ locality of each of the faults.Second, we show how to enhance a known transformer that makes input/output algorithms self-stabilizing. It now takes as input an efficient construction algorithm and an efficient self-stabilizing proof labeling scheme, and produces an efficient self-stabilizing algorithm. When used for MST, the transformer produces a memory optimal self-stabilizing algorithm, whose time complexity, namely, $O(n)$, is significantly better even than that of previous algorithms. (The time complexity of previous MST algorithms that used $\\Omega(\\log^2 n)$ memory bits per node was $O(n^2)$, and the time for optimal space algorithms was $O(n|E|)$.) Inherited from our proof labelling scheme, our self-stabilising MST construction algorithm also has the following two properties: (1) if faults occur after the construction ended, then they are detected by some nodes within $O(\\log ^2 n)$ time in synchronous networks"

Male circumcision does not protect women from acquiring HIV, nor does it protect men who have sex with men (Wawer 2009, Jameson 2009).\n\n&gt;What's worse, because of the publicity surrounding the African studies, men in Africa are now starting to believe that if they are circumcised, they do not need to wear condoms, which will increase the spread of HIV (Westercamp 2010).

Assuming you are solidly intermediate, start with around 12-15 sets per week per push, pull and leg movement. Perform most sets at RPE 7-9, taking light days when you need them, and SLOWLY adding sets over the weeks until you are pushing the limit of what you can recover from.

The radiation pressure gradients in a laser beam also contribute in the aggregation of polymers , thus producing a phase transition. The local heating may induce thermophoretic forces which attract towards the laser beam one of the binary-mixture components [9]. Other forces like electrostriction can also be involved [10].

Heating is a function of transferring thermal energy from one body to another, in this case the heater core to the air being blown by the blower. Humid air is dense with both air and water molecules, much more than dry air. Water is a near perfect compound for thermal energy transfer. So humid air will always be quicker to both cool and warm up compared to dry air. \n\nNow the effects of humid air are diffrent on our bodies. In the winter humid air feels colder because again it's better at transferring energy than dry air. So you'll feel like it's colder when it's cold and humid since it's pulling more heat from your skin than dry air.\n\nNow if you want to defrost your window the fastest turn on the defroster and turn off your ac.

In a general case when multiple copies of unknown and reference states are available I propose a scheme consisting of beamsplitters and photodetectors that is optimal within linear optics. UI can be considered as a search in a quantum database, whose elements are the reference states and the query is represented by the unknown state. This perspective motivated me to show that reference states can be recovered after the measurement and might be used (with reduced success rate) in subsequent UI. Moreover, I analyze the influence of noise in preparation of coherent states on the performance of the proposed setup. Another problem I address is the unambiguous comparison of a pair of unknown qudit unitary channels. I characterize all solutions and identify the optimal ones. I prove that in optimal experiments for comparison of unitary channels the entanglement is necessary. The last task I studied is the unambiguous comparison of unknown non-degenerate projective measurements. I distinguish between measurement devices with apriori labeled and unlabeled outcomes.

Neural network training data with extremely low noise are computed by averaging the random detected data with pileup for a large numbers of exposures of the phantom. Each exposure is equivalent to a projection image or one projection of a computed tomography scan. Training data with high noise are computed by using data from one exposure. Finally, training data are computed by adding random data to the low noise data. The added random data are multivariate normal with zero mean and covariance equal to the sample covariance of data for an object with properly chosen attenuation. To test the estimators, random data are computed for different thicknesses of three test objects with different compositions. These are used as inputs to the neural network estimators. The mean squared errors (MSE), variance and square of the bias of the neural networks' outputs with the random object data are each compared to the CRLB. Results: The MSE for a network trained with low noise data and added noise is close to the CRLB for both the low and high pileup cases.

In this way, we often get local stabilization results. Tackling this particular nonlinearity in the case of finite dimensional systems is already a difficult problem. However, nowadays, numerous techniques are available (see e.g. [39, 41, 37]) and such systems can be analyzed with an appropriate Lyapunov function and a sector condition of the saturation map, as introduced in [39]. In the literature, there are few papers studying this topic in the infinite dimensional case. Among them, we can cite [18], [29], where a wave equation equipped with a saturated distributed actuator is studied, and [12], where a coupled PDE/ODE system modeling a switched power converter with a transmission line is considered.

While these bubbles have burst, causing asset prices (e.g., housing and commercial property) to decline, the liabilities owed to global investors remain at full price, generating questions regarding the solvency of governments and their banking systems.\nHow each European country involved in this crisis borrowed and invested the money varies. For example, Ireland's banks lent the money to property developers, generating a massive property bubble. When the bubble burst, Ireland's government and taxpayers assumed private debts. In Greece, the government increased its commitments to public workers in the form of extremely generous wage and pension benefits, with the former doubling in real terms over 10 years.

This gain of information can equally well be viewed as a decrease in uncertainty about the outcome of an experiment. In this case the standard measure of information, and thus uncertainty, is Shannon entropy [AD75, G77]. It enjoys several advantages-it is characterized uniquely by a few, very natural properties, and it can be conveniently used in decision processes. This application is based on the principle of maximum entropy; it has become a popular method of relating decisions to uncertainty. This paper demonstrates that an equally integrated theory can be built on the foundation of possibility theory. We first show how to define measures of in formation and uncertainty for possibility assignments. Next we construct an information-based metric on the space of all possibility distributions defined on a given domain. It allows us to capture the notion of proximity in information content among the distributions.

To the best of our knowledge, the first and the only rigorous mathematical analysis of these sophisticated discrete generation particle filters is developed in the pioneering articles by Le Gland-Monbet-Tran and by Mandel-Cobb-Beezley, which were published in the early 2010s. Nevertheless, besides the fact that these studies prove the asymptotic consistency of the Ensemble Kalman filter, they provide exceedingly pessimistic meanerror estimates that grow exponentially fast with respect to the time horizon, even for linear Gaussian filtering problems with stable one dimensional signals. In the present article we develop a novel self-contained and complete stochastic perturbation analysis of the fluctuations, the stability, and the long-time performance of these discrete generation ensemble Kalman particle filters, including time-uniform and non-asymptotic mean-error estimates that apply to possibly unstable signals.

They used more realistic conditions, including 3% sterile faeces to mimic the conditions in which many disinfectants were used.

This figure named by the author the \"equivalent pore\", is with its elliptical shape similar to the one of the mean pore defined by the mean directional chord between the interfaces in the texture. Different methods of \"equivalent pore\" establishing are analyzed : by conformal map of the fiber network or of the texture interfaces, by images stereometric analysis of texture tomographical cuts, by scattering and diffraction of a laser light beam impacting the fibrous texture or the material surface replica, by hard X-ray absorption and phase contrast at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facilities(ESRF), in Grenoble. The \"equivalent pore\" concept allows us to study random unordered sets behavior in strength fields while simplifying this analysis. Thus a phenomenon occurring in a plane set, in two dimensions, can be analyzed on its \"equivalent pore\" linear outline, and a phenomenon which occurs in volume in a three dimensional set can be analyzed on its \"equivalent pore\" warped surface. This concept has been applied for physical, mechanical, optical and ionic conduction properties of materials like papers, boards, felts, nonwoven textiles, polymer foams, metallic alloys"

The solvent system must form two phases without excess emulsification in order to form droplets. The densities of the two phases must also be sufficiently different so that the phases will move past each other in the column. Many DCCC solvent systems contain both chloroform and water. The solvent system used in the seminal publication was made from chloroform, acetic acid, and aqueous 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. Many subsequent solvents systems were made with chloroform, methanol, and water which is sometimes represented as a ChMWat solvent system. Solvent systems formulated with ''n''-butanol, water and a modifier such as acetic acid, pyridine or n-propanol have also enjoyed some success in DCCC. In some cases, non-aqueous biphasic solvent systems such as acetonitrile and methanol have been utilized.\nThe main difference between DCCC and other types of countercurrent chromatography techniques is that there is no vigorous mixing of phases to enhance the mass transfer of compounds"

AS the under the sink tank has a bladder in it, each drop of water that goes into the tank puts more back pressure on the RO unit.  it can equalize to your water input pressure and cause a no flow type situation.\n\ndid you notice any changes to your house water pressure?  maybe its not coming into your house with as much pressure as before?  do you have any PSI or TDS meters on the RO unit?  a picture of the whole setup would go a long ways here.  there are so many different ways to setup an RO, but only a few  correct ways ;)  so pics would really help!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAS an FYI - you should think about getting some pressure and TDS meters"

In LCs at interfaces, the so-called easy axes correspond to the favoured orientations of the LC director close to the interface.

It is well known that, in anchoring phenomena, two major effects compete to impose the anchoring directions of a liquid crystal, first, the interactions between molecules and the interface, second, the substrate roughness whose role has been analyzed by Berreman [2]. The influence of adsorbed molecular functional groups at the interface is most often dominant with, for example in carbon substrates, a main influence of unsaturated carbon bonds orientation at the interface [3]. In common LC displays, there is one unique easy axis, but modifications of surfaces have allowed for the discovery of promising new anchoring-related properties.

This shows that the empirical mean has a bias in 1/n proportional to the gradient of the curvature tensor contracted twice with the covariance matrix, and a modulation of the convergence rate of the covariance matrix proportional to the covariance-curvature tensor. We show that our non-asymptotic high concentration expansion is consistent with the asymptotic expansion of the BP-CLT. Experiments on constant curvature spaces demonstrate that both expansions are very accurate in their domain of validity. Moreover, the modulation of the convergence rate of the empirical mean's covariance matrix is explicitly encoded using a scalar multiplicative factor that gives an intuitive vision of the impact of the curvature: the variance of the empirical mean decreases faster than in the Euclidean case in negatively curved space forms, with an infinite speed for an infinite negative curvature.

Each state of the DFA holds information about which type parameters are already bound in that state. This information is used to identify whether a method invocation in a chain newly binds a type to a type parameter, or refers to a previously bound type. The identification is required since a type parameter in a chain is bound at a particular method invocation, and that bound type is referred to in the following method invocations.

It sounds like she is just seeing new ways to represent facts she already knows. The \"knowledge\" was acquired prior; her experience with red outside the black-and-white-room is not new. We could test this by showing her something non-red, and asking her to identify the content based on what she has learned about red from inside the room. Alternatively, if she couldn't learn the knowledge from in the room, a better way to resolve this problem is to ask whether this is a kind of knowledge that can't be learned from within the room but still physical. Why do we assume this kind of knowledge isn't simply physical knowledge? This rests on how you define \"physicality\". This is just a word game; I can make it so that physicalism can totally account for consciousness by broadening or narrowing the definition to include Mary's knowledge.\n\nedit: word choice, see infra\ndnew: &gt; The fact that zombies are conceivable"

In particular, we give an explicit one-parameter family of systems on $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ which transitions between being of toric type, semitoric type, and hypersemitoric type depending on the value of the parameter.

Capitalism inevitably tends toward big corporations rewriting the rules more and more in their own favor. The independent and impartial government you're talking about is impossible under capitalism, and your attempt to separate government/politics from economics falls flat on its face if you know literally anything about history.\nMurffinator: The only way it becomes profitable to buy off government and \"rewrite the rules\" is first if there is corruption within government and second if government is powerful enough to be worth buying off in the first place. If government didn't have the power to create laws and rules in favor of certain groups over another, there's no reason to buy them off. Those who argue in favor of bigger government and are also against people buying off government are caught between a rock and a hard place.

A significant difference was found between the T1PCr and T1Pi of MS patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, the use of a fixed correction factor led to systematically higher estimated concentrations of PCr and Pi than when using individually corrected factors. We observed significant differences between the two patient populations and healthy controls for resting [PCr] -- MS only, [Pi], [ADP], [H2PO4-] and pH -- COVID19 only, and post-exercise [PCr],[Pi] and [H2PO4-] - MS only. The dynamic indicators $\\tau$PCr, $\\tau$Pi, ViPCr and Vmax were reduced for COVID19 and MS patients compared to controls. Conclusion: Our results show that QCS in dynamic 31P-MRS studies results in smaller data variability and therefore impacts study sample size and power. Although QCS resulted in discarded data and therefore reduced the acceptable data and subject numbers, this rigorous and unbiased approach allowed for proper assessment of muscle metabolites and metabolism in patient populations. The outcomes include an increased metabolite T1, which directly affect the T1 correction factor applied to the amplitudes"

Mona discovers that the proposed transformation does not work in Coq due to a restriction in the termination checker. In fact the transformation does not work in Agda anymore as well, as the termination checker in Agda has been improved. We follow Mona on an educational journey through the land of functional programming where she learns about concepts like free monads and containers as well as basics and restrictions of proof assistants like Coq. These concepts are well-known individually, but their interplay gives rise to a solution for Mona's problem based on the originally proposed monadic tranformation that has not been presented before. When Mona starts to test her approach by proving a statement about simple Haskell functions, she realizes that her approach has an additional advantage over the original idea in Agda.

I have no experience laying floor in a basement and not much experience flooring in general.

The probability associated with each firm's trajectories is the result of several contradictory effects: the firm tends to shift towards sectors with the greatest long-term return, but must take into account the impact of its shift on its attractiveness for investors throughout its trajectory. Since this trajectory depends largely on the average capital of transition sectors, a firm's attractiveness during its relocation depends on the relative level of capital in those sectors. Thus, an under-capitalized firm reaching a high-capital sector will experience a loss of attractiveness, and subsequently, in investors. Moreover, the firm must also consider the effects of competition in the intermediate sectors. An under-capitalized firm will tend to be ousted out towards sectors with lower average capital, while an over-capitalized firm will tend to shift towards higher averagecapital sectors.

I realize the term is overloaded, but by \"strength training\" I mean you're optimizing for strength (instead of hypertrophy or endurance), so you're doing an exercise with enough weight (or a certain bodyweight progression) so that you can only do 3-6 reps each time without going to failure (leaving a bit in the tank for the next set), which is somewhere between 80-95% of your 1RM.

The person above probably thought you were referring to passive stretching (ex: touching your toes and holding for a few seconds).  Active stretching should proceed all workouts if you intend on keeping it safe.  Active stretching includes jumping jacks, lunges without weight, straight leg marches, skips, etc.  It should not be strenuous or difficult, but it should get your heart rate going, get blood flowing through your muscles, and increase body temperature.\n\nAnother good way to remove muscle soreness is through something called myofascial release.  It is essentially a massage of your muscles; you can do it by using a foam roll or a PVC Pipe and rolling it down your muscles.  What it does is separate the muscle fibers in your muscles back to their normal differences.  After a workout, the fascia (outer coating) of the fibers can mesh together, inhibiting sliding filaments, which helps cause soreness.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam_rolling\n\nAnd finally, you can do a lactic acid drain.  After a good lower body workout or run, lay on the grown with your legs straight.  Put your feet about 4-6 inches above the ground (ex"

Or, in the case of *sous vide* cooking, the well-distributed bubbles of air will allow runaway aerobic bacterial spoilage as the article cooks.\n\nOn the other hand, because we're standing at the very bottom of a metaphorical ocean of air, even a light-duty countertop vacuum can create a difference in atmospheric pressure of about 10 PSI to squeeze out the majority of the smaller air bubbles - both those trapped between the bag and the food, and those stuck between cellular membranes (which is why using a vacuum container substantially reduces marinating/brining time). As a result, when food is subject to a proper commercial vacuum, much less oxidation and dehydration occurs while frozen - and far less opportunity for bacteria to reproduce during *sous vide* cooking.\n\nThat being said, this is a reasonably good way to reduce freezer burn in stuff you're only planning to freeze for a month or two, without a big cash outlay for an actual vacuum unit.\nIsntThatSpecia1: That and a home-grade vacuum sealer is like $50.

Approach: This paper proposes out-of-things debugging, an online debugging approach especially designed for IoT systems. The debugger is always-on as it ensures constant availability to for instance debug post-deployment situations. Upon a failure or breakpoint, out-of-things debugging moves the state of a deployed application to the developer's machine. Developers can then debug the application locally by applying operations (e.g., step commands) to the retrieved state. Once debugging is finished, developers can commit bug fixes to the device through live update capabilities. Finally, by means of a fine-grained flexible interface for accessing remote resources, developers have full control over the debugging overhead imposed on the device, and the access to device hardware resources (e.g., sensors) needed during local debugging. Knowledge: Out-of-things debugging maintains good properties of remote debugging as it does not require physical access to the device to debug it, while reducing debugging interference since there are no network delays on operations (e.g., stepping) issued on the debugger"

It has been described as \"an external Council of ecclesiastical worthies\".  There were often arguments during meetings about the future direction of the college when Edward Stuart Talbot was Warden (from the college's foundation until 1888). Over time, the Tutors came to have a greater influence on the direction of the college"

Introduction Fusion or coalescence between drops is a key process in a wide range of phenomena: phase transition in fluids and liquid mixtures or polymers, stability of foams and emulsions, and sintering in metallurgy (Eggers 1998), which is why the problem of coalescence has already received considerable attention. Most of the studies of this process so far have been devoted to the coalescence of two spherical drops floating in a medium. The kinetics of the process before and after the drops have touched each other is governed by the hydrodynamics inside and outside the drops and by the van der Waals forces when the drops are within mesoscopic distance from each other (Yiantsios \\& Davis 1991). The composite drop that results from the coalescence of two drops relaxes to a spherical shape within a time which is dominated by the relaxation of the flow inside and outside (Nikolayev, Beysens \\& Guenoun 1996; Nikolayev \\& Beysens 1997).

Don't get me wrong the shape and final product look great. That is why I want to point this out. If this was a first attempt then you have a lot of potential to make great knives.

It is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion walk : the mean free path $\\lambda$ (average distance between two scattering events, i.e. between two direction-changes), and the single-scattering phase function p(u s , u i) (probability density function of the scattering direction u s for an incident direction u i).

These distributions have the same mean (<\\delta\\u{psion}> ~ 4.2 km s-1) and standard deviation (\\sigma(\\delta\\u{psion}) ~ 1.5 km s-1). This mean value is also close to that of the linewidth distribution of the CH+ visible transitions detected in the solar neighbourhood. We show that the lack of absorption components narrower than 2 km s-1 is not an artefact caused by noise: the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ line profiles are therefore statistically broader than those of most species detected in absorption in diffuse interstellar gas (e. g. HCO+, CH, or CN). The SH+/CH+ column density ratio observed in the components located away from the Galactic centre spans two orders of magnitude and correlates with the CH+ abundance. Conversely, the ratio observed in the components close to the Galactic centre varies over less than one order of magnitude with no apparent correlation with the CH+ abundance.

Cattle survive very well without human interference in many parts of the world, especially in northern Australia. While these are beef rather than dairy cattle they are still the same species so cattle as a whole would not be driven to extinction if we stopped dairy farming as long as we maintained some herds in other parts of the world. Furthermore, dairy cattle have been strongly bred for producing milk which puts them at higher risk of disease. This would make it more difficult to reintroduce them into the wild without human aid, though it is possible we could slowly select for hardier individuals or take up a caretaker role with dairy herds until they can flourish without our interference.

By computing this quality factor $F$ together with the topological characteristics for a wide range of models and parameters, we find that Majoranas are significantly more robust (i.e., have a higher value of $F$) compared with non-topological ZBCPs in the ideal low-temperature limit. Even at a temperature as high as the experimentally used $20$ mK, we find that we can set a threshold value of $F\\sim 2.5$ (for $\\epsilon=0.1$) so that ZBCPs associated with a quality factor $F>2.5$ are likely topological and $F\\ll 2.5$ are topologically trivial. More precisely, the value of $F$ is operationally related to the degree of separation of the Majorana modes in the system, although $F$ uses only the experimentally measured tunnel conductance properties.

A nail can't make a choice, it just harms indiscriminately. \n\nIf a child went to climb your fence to get his frisbee and posed no threat to you, would you shoot him? The fact that the nail doesn't assess a threat is what makes it a no-no, just like a bear trap or a shotgun on a string tied to your front door.\n\nAlso, you used the phrase \"more sneakier\" earlier, I wouldn't throw any stones if I was you.\nit-does-not-matter69: I can only imagine there being consequences if an innocent person got hurt by it?

We extend AspectJ with a small set of annotations and interfaces that allows DSAL designers to define a semantic-preserving transformation to AspectJ and interface with AspectJ tools. Our transformation approach enables the use of standard language workbench to implement DSALs and use of standard aspect development tools to program with those DSALs. As a result, DSALs regain first-class status with respect to both DSLs and aspect languages. This, on the one hand, lowers the cost of developing DSALs to the level of DSLs and, on the other hand, raises the effectiveness of using a DSAL to the level of a GPAL. Consequently, LOM becomes cost-effective compared to the LOP baseline. We modified the ajc compiler to support our approach. Using two different language workbenches (Spoofax and Xtext) we then implemented several DSALs. AspectJ was supported out-of-the-box.

Our paper describes how such CEP patterns are elegantly added to an actor-based programming language. Knowledge: Based on our findings, we propose an extension of the single-message matching paradigm of contemporary actor-based languages in order to support a multiple-message matching way of thinking in the same way as proposed by CEP languages. Our proposal thus enriches the actor-model by ways of declaratively describing complex message combinations to which an actor can respond. Grounding: We base the problem-statement of the paper on an online poll in the home automation community that has motivated the real need for the CEP-based synchronisation operators between actors proposed in the paper. Furthermore, we implemented a DSL -- called Sparrow -- that supports said operators and we argue quantitatively (in terms of LOC and in terms of a reduction of the concerns that have to be handled by programmers) that the DSL outperforms existing approaches.

Using numerical simulations and mathematical analysis, we explore the short-term and long-term dynamics of the model upon alternance of phases of hippocampal replay and retrieval cue of an external input. This external input is encodable as a memory pattern in the form of a multiple bump attractor pattern in the individual neural fields. In the model, hippocampal memory patterns become encoded first, before neocortical ones, because of the smaller distances between the bumps of the hippocampal memory patterns. As a result, retrieval of the input pattern in the neocortex at short time-scales necessitates the additional input delivered by the memory pattern of the hippocampus. Neocortical memory patterns progressively consolidate at longer times, up to a point where their retrieval does not need the support of the hippocampus anymore. At longer times, perturbation of the hippocampal neural fields by neurogenesis erases the hippocampus pattern, leading to a final state where the memory pattern is exclusively evoked in the neocortex. Therefore, the dynamics of our model successfully reproduces the main features of the standard consolidation theory. This suggests that neurogenesis"

Kids understand by calmly telling them (in age appropriate language) that their behavior isn't ok, and the need to make an adjustment or there will be consequences.\n\nThe toughest part is the consistency. Always being on point and following up with clear expectations, warnings, and consequences is very draining, especially at first.  There is lots of pushback, and lots of time learning how to stand correctly in the corner with discipline.  Once kid realizes that you are going to do what you say, and you have a reason for doing it, they begin to self-regulate.\n\nI have two very willful, rambunctious kids. They can be crazy, but with very little guidance, they shape right up.  I'm very proud of how grown up they behave, yet are totally just kids. I try to treat them as human beings, and try to explain things to them with as little bullshit as possible. Turns out, it's very little.  Kids are whip smart and deserve to be treated with respect.

He used coins on graph paper to demonstrate his theory by placing pennies and dimes in different patterns on the \"board\" and then moving them one by one if they were in an \"unhappy\" situation.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Strategic ^realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_realism) ^| [^Focal ^point ^\\(game ^theory)](https"

You would put a plexiglas plate between the head and the wood plate and edge light the plexiglass.  The plexi could be routed (standard router) with a design or if you have a laser cutter, plexi is extremely easy to cut and etch, expecially with a CO2 laser.  Mine cuts very quickly and etches very well.  Here is an edge lit sign to get an idea:\nhttp://www.valleydesignsnd.com/catalog/images/products/ac10212015_2.jpg\n\nAnother option to look at is tossing the LED thing and looking at EL wire.  Its very flexible, easy to work with and isn't extremely intense like LED is.  Is more of a subtle but distinctive look.  Doesn't put out much light so won't do anything for lighting up your head.

An arrest of cells in G0 or G1 is often seen as a result of lack of nutrients (growth factors), for example after serum deprivation.\nCell cycle analysis was first described in 1969 at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory by a group from the University of California using the Feulgen staining technique. The first protocol for cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide staining was presented in 1975 by Awtar Krishan from Harvard Medical School and is still widely cited today.\nMultiparameter analysis of the cell cycle includes, in addition to measurement of cellular DNA content, other cell cycle related constituents/features. The concurrent measurement of cellular DNA and RNA content, or DNA susceptibility to denaturation at low pH using the metachromatic dye acridine orange, reveals the G1Q, G1A, and G1B cell cycle compartments and also makes it possible to discriminate between S, G2 and mitotic cells.

So when there's a hornet's nest nearby, close your windows when you turn on the lights.\n\nWe rented a vacation home in the woods, and there was a hornet's nest under the ridge of the roof, right above the bathroom window.We were there all day and didn't even notice they were there until the evenening when we turned the lights on.

It rehabilitates the labor theory of value, based on the connection between money and labor due the monetary payment of wages, which allows the homogenization of various kinds of concrete labor into abstract labor. It shows that value is then a dimension of commodities and that this dimension is time, i.e. the time of physics. On this background, the book shows that the calculation of values for all commodities is always possible, even in the case of joint production, and that there cannot be any commodity residue left by this calculation. As a further step, this book provides a coherent theory of the realization of the product, which occurs in the circulation process. Using an idea - the widow's cruse - introduced by Keynes in his Treatise on Money, it brings to light the mechanism behind the transformation of money values into money prices and of surplus-value into profits and other transfer incomes, ensuring the formation of monetary profits.

Thus, to make static analysis reusable again, we employ relational Reference Attribute Grammars (RAGs) by creating such a mapping to a domain-independent overlay structure using higher-order attributes.

However, the vast majority of quarterly coats of arms display arms which are claimed by descent:  in other words, they join together coats of arms of the ancestors of the bearer of the arms.\nStrict rules apply in English Heraldry, both as to what arms may be displayed by way of quarterings, and the order in which they may be displayed.  Men and women are always entitled to display the arms of their paternal line but are not usually entitled to display by way of quartering the arms of families from whom there is descent only through a female line (for example, the arms of a mother or grandmother"

This doesn't necessarily have to be an \"evil force\".\n\nTo get my point across an extreme example: That threatening person maybe does so because it doesn't really have another option, because of some catastrophic event that just happened. Or because it is actually a person that tried to be too nice and went insane. Maybe a father that for some reason had to care for a lot of children and stayed up long enough to get mental illnesses. In general what is considered evil often is just trying to survive, like when you think about bacterias.\n[deleted]: I don't really believe in Evil as a subjective quality of people, but as a state of things.  E.g., Nazi Germany was an Evil in that it perpetuated a genocidal ideology, consumerism is Evil in that it allows for the increased rate of destruction of the Earth by separating the consequences of resource extraction from those who benefit, etc.  The actors themselves in each social state are not Evil, but the collective action and acceptance of the status quo creates Evil.

A second goal is to obtain more detailed structural information on each of the complexes separated by the mass spectrometer. One such approaches is ion mobility spectrometry, and even today the challenge lies in the structural interpretation of the measurements. We showed that, although structures such as G-quadruplexes are well-preserved in the MS conditions, double helices actually get more compact in the gas phase. These major rearrangements forced us to challenge comfortable assumptions. Further work is still needed to generalize how to deduce structures in solution from ion mobility spectrometry data, and in particular how to account for the electrospray charging mechanisms and for ion internal energy effects. These studies also called for complementary approaches to ion mobility. Recently, we applied isotope exchange labeling mass spectrometry to characterize nucleic acid structures for the first time, and we reported the first ever circular dichroism ion spectroscopy measurement on mass-selected trapped ions.

Knowledge: This paper's main contribution is the design and implementation of ShillDB, a language for writing secure database-backed applications. ShillDB enables reasoning about database access at the language level through capabilities, which limit which database tables a program can access, and contracts, which limit what operations a program can perform on those tables. ShillDB contracts are expressed as part of function interfaces, making it easy to specify different access control policies for different components. Contracts act as executable security documentation for ShillDB programs and are enforced by the language runtime. Further, ShillDB provides database access control guarantees independent of (and in addition to) the security mechanisms of the underlying database management system. Grounding: We have implemented a prototype of ShillDB and have used it to implement the backend for a lending library reservation system with contracts for each endpoint to evaluate the performance and usability of ShillDB. Further, we benchmark individual database operations in ShillDB to"
