Yet, the countries who do have nuclear weapons refuse to give them up. Why? For the reasons I talked about before: We don't trust each other, so how can the USA make sure that, if they destroy their nuclear arsenal, Russia won't just take over the world under a Socialist Dystopia? We also want to have an advantage over others. If other countries don't fear you, then you can't just have what you want.\n\nEven our best hope of achieving real unity as a species, the UN, is corrupted. There are five countries with veto power in the security council, that use that power for their own benefits.\n\nWith all that considered, I truly don't see the intrinsic value in human life that would make me say: We need to protect it at all costs.

Recently, another approach based on the open quantum system formalism started being used. In this framework, one solves a quantum evolution for in-medium quarkonium. Dissociation and recombination are accounted for consistently. However, the connection between the semi-classical transport equation and the quantum evolution is not clear. In this dissertation, I will try to address the issues raised above. As a warm-up project, I will first study a similar problem: $\\alpha$-$\\alpha$ scattering at the $^8$Be resonance inside an $e^-e^+\\gamma$ plasma. By applying pionless effective field theory and thermal field theory, I will show how the plasma screening effect modifies the $^8$Be resonance energy and width. I will discuss the need to use the open quantum system formalism when studying the time evolution of a system embedded inside a plasma. Then I will use effective field theory of QCD and the open quantum system formalism to derive a Lindblad equation for bound and unbound heavy quark antiquark pairs inside a weakly-coupled"

Replace this drywall with tile, or something more resistant to moisture.\nIf you wanted to go real fancy you could finish much of the room in cedar like a sauna.   \n\n* Caulking - If you anticipate lots of water on the floor, or on any place it might be wise to caulk places where the water might run.

The reason comes from the property of the GP that uncertainty quantification can be calculated. Furthermore, it has several nice properties. For example, the conditional GP at observation data (linear equality constraints) is still a GP [5]. Additionally, some inequality constraints (such as monotonicity and convexity) of output computer responses are related to partial derivatives. In such cases, the partial derivatives of the GP are also GPs. Incorporating an infinite number of linear inequality constraints into a GP emulator, the problem becomes more difficult. The reason is that the resulting conditional process is not a GP. In the literature of interpolation with inequality constraints, we find two types of meth-ods. The first one is deterministic and based on splines, which have the advantage that the inequality constraints are satisfied in the whole input domain (see e.g. [16], [24] and [25]). The second one is based on the simulation of the conditional GP by using the subdivision of the input set (see e.g. [1], [6] and [11]). In"

A well defined \"red sequence\" composed of early-type galaxies exists in all environments at high luminosity, but it lacks of low luminosity (dwarf) galaxies in the lowest density environment. Conversely low luminosity isolated galaxies are predominantly of late-type. In other words the low luminosity end of the distribution is dominated by red dE galaxies in clusters and groups and by dwarf blue amorphous systems in the lowest density regions. At z=0 we find evidence for strong evolution induced by the environment (Nurture). Transformations take place mostly at low luminosity when star forming dwarf galaxies inhabiting low density environments migrate into amorphous passive dwarf ellipticals in their infall into denser regions. The mechanism involves suppression of the star formation due to gas stripping, without significant mass growth, as proposed by Boselli et al. (2008a). This process is more efficient and fast in ambients of increasing density. In the highest density environments (around clusters) the truncation of the star formation happens fast enough (few 100 Myr) to produce the signature of post-star-burst in galaxy spectra.

Each local commutative fqf-ring is a fqp-ring, and a commutative ring is fqf if and only if it is locally fqf. These fqf-rings are defined in [6] without a definition of quasi-flat modules. Here we propose a definition of these modules and another definition of fqf-ring which is equivalent to the one given in [6]. We also introduce the module property of self-flatness. Each quasi-flat module is self-flat but we do not know if the converse holds. On the other hand, each flat module is quasi-flat and any finitely generated module is quasi-flat if and only if it is flat modulo its annihilator. In Section 2 we give a complete characterization of local commutative rings for which each ideal is self-flat. These rings R are fqp and their nilradical N is the subset of zerodivisors of R. In the case where R is not a chain ring for which N = N 2 and R N is not coherent every ideal is flat modulo its annihilator. Then in Section 3 we deduce that any ideal of a chain ring (valuation ring) R is quasi-projective if and only if it is almost maximal and each zerodivisor is nilpotent"

The Soviet Union would have also benefited from a rapid German collapse, and its participation in the war against Japan was greatly desired. The staff at Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) considered Montgomery's proposed advance on the Ruhr and Berlin and Bradley's proposed advance on Metz and the Saar, and assessed both to be feasible, but only on the assumptions that the port of Antwerp was brought rapidly into service, that considerable additional air, rail and road transportation became available, and that the other Allied armies were already poised on the German border.

Clumpy galaxies appear to be less unstable at z~0.6 than at z~2, which could explain why the UV clumps tend to vanish in rest-frame optical images of z~0.6 clumpy galaxies, conversely to z~2 clumpy galaxies, in which the stellar phase can substantially fragment. This suggests that the former correspond to patchy star-formation regions superimposed on a smoother mass distribution. A possible and widespread scenario for driving clump formation relies on instabilities by cold streams penetrating the dark matter halos where clumpy galaxies inhabit. While such a gas accretion process is predicted to be significant in massive, z~2 haloes, it is also predicted to be strongly suppressed in similar, z~0.6 haloes, which could explain why lowest-z clumpy galaxies appear to be driven by a different mechanism. Instead, I found that interactions are probably the dominant driver leading to the formation of clumpy galaxies at z<1. I argue that the nature of z>1 clumpy galaxies remains more uncertain. While cold flows could be an important driver at z~2, I also argue that the observed and cumulative merger fraction"

So when there's a hornet's nest nearby, close your windows when you turn on the lights.\n\nWe rented a vacation home in the woods, and there was a hornet's nest under the ridge of the roof, right above the bathroom window.We were there all day and didn't even notice they were there until the evenening when we turned the lights on. We had the windows open because it was really hot. The hornets were mesmerized by the lights, so they flew right in and some mild panic ensued while we got acquainted"

We discuss an unexpected 5 MeV excess, observed in the reactor flux energy spectrum, that may be affecting the oscillation interpretation of the short baseline reactor data.

The drawing is now in the Morgan Library & Museum in New York City.  Van Gogh probably sent the painting to Theo with a consignment in September 1889.\nVan Gogh made several other paintings of wheat fields with cypresses when he was able to leave the asylum grounds and explore the local landscape, with the wheat rapidly turning to a ripe yellow. Besides a fondness for cypresses, van Gogh had a special affinity with wheat fields; he depicted them dozens of times over the years; to Vincent they symbolized the cycle of life and death, and he found in them both solace and inspiration.\nAlthough the composition is similar to several paintings by other artists such as Monet, Renoir, Sisley, and Pissarro, the art historian Ronald Pickvance says that \"compared to high Impressionist practice, color is used more locally and the brushstrokes are more organic"

If your grandmother is being held at gunpoint until you meet some demand of the gunman, your action can hardly be said to be *actually* consenting, even if you say \"yes\".\n\n(2) The only way to impair nominal consent is to become physically incapable of communicating. That nominal consent is tied *only* to the physical capability to communicate and not to preferences of the consenting agent fails entirely to capture what we mean when we talk about consent.\n\n(3) If someone is incapable of speaking, they may still be capable of consenting (although we'll have no way of knowing it).\n\nSo what we're really concerned with is *actual* consent, not nominal consent. However, actual consent is just not possible as long as there is unequal power between the putatively consenting parties. Actual consent requires the absence of coercion, but the existence of unequal power necessarily entails the exercise of power over the disempowered party, which is coercive.

You need to face nail any loose or creaky boards with barbed nails. Those gaps need to be filled, and they need to be cleaned out before you fill them. My recommendation would be a small fine bristled brass wire brush. Put the vacuum next to it as you brush so the crap doesn't fall back down the gaps.\n\nNow you need to fill the gaps. The only thing you should consider using to fill these is a product called Woodwise. It's specifically meant for hardwood floors and it expands and contracts at the same rate as the wood, so it's unlikely to crack or work its way out. It can be thinned with water and troweled over the floor so it flows into the gaps better. You can be messy here, as the sander will knock down any mess, just make sure it gets pushed deeply into the gaps. It's a GREAT product.

Many characters from this and other Black Ops titles can be used as the player's character model in this mode.\nDevelopment for the game started shortly after the release of Black Ops III. Treyarch chose not to create a traditional singleplayer campaign for the game at the beginning of production, instead focusing on a new 'Career' mode with a greater focus on the multiplayer aspect. They cited an increased interest for multiplayer and lack of time spent by the playerbase on the campaign mode as reasons why they shifted their focus. Black Ops 4 utilizes Blizzard's Battle.net platform for the Windows version instead of Steam, the first game in the series to do so. Teasing of the game began in March 2018, with a full reveal taking place later in May. Two betas were held for the game; one for the multiplayer in August and one for Blackout in September. The release date was moved up to October instead of the series' usual November in an attempt to avoid coinciding with the release of other high-profile games.\nPre-release reception of the game was negative due to the game's lack"

But this does not yet provide a theory of induction, i.e. an answer to the question how epistemic states so represented are changed tbrough information or experience. There is a convincing partial answer: if the new information is compatible with the old epistemic state, then the new epistemic state is simply represented by the conjunction of the new information and the old beliefs. This answer is partial because it does not cover the quite common case where the new information is incompatible with the old beliefs.

One important byproduct consists of the diagnosis usefulness of stochastic dynamics that RP resonances provide. This is illustrated in the case of a stochastic Hopf bifurcation in Part II. There, it is shown that such a bifurcation has a clear manifestation in terms of a geometric organization of the RP resonances along discrete parabolas in the left half plane. Such geometric features formed by (reduced) RP resonances are extractable from time series and allow thus for providing an unambiguous \"signature\" of nonlinear oscillations embedded within a stochastic background.

You can certainly try to attack the idea that God is necessarily omnibenevolent, but a Christian would likely say that a non-benevolent God is like a married bachelor -- it is a contradiction. I'm not a theist, but if you're going to attack the theist's argument, at least entertain his primary axiom.\neterneraki: Omni benevolence is not an attribute that all religions accept as fact.\nReddit_Repartee: Agreed completely.

The fusion rules for decomposing the tensor product of representations labeled j_1 and j_2 take the same form as the Clebsch-Gordan series for SU(2).

She might have confessed (this part apparently wasn't recorded by the author she was talking to) to lying at the trial when she exaggerated the encounter and said that Till grabbed her waist.  She didn't lie to her husband or say anything to him.  Someone else in the store told him something.  \n\nAnd accounts differ on whether Till whistled and, if so, why.  His cousin said he whistled at Bryant as a joke.  Some other people say he whistled at a card game.  His mother said he whistled as a verbal tic.\nBeautifulArtistic649: Exactly so there is no concrete proof or claim HE whistled at HER.

To evaluate our proposal, we implemented Bee/LMR, a live VM for a Smalltalk-derivative environment in 22057 lines of code. We analyze case studies on tuning the garbage collector, avoiding recompilations by the just-in-time compiler, and adding support to optimize code with vector instructions to demonstrate the trade-offs of extending exploratory programming to VM development in the context of an industrial application used in production. Based on the case studies, we illustrate how our approach facilitates the daily development work of a small team of application developers.

So, 10 years or no worries mechanically. Or, buy used and face issues that are not warrantied. I can see buying used, cash deal. No payments for how ever long car lasts. Which could be a week. Or 10 years. Manufacturers warranty is the difference for me.\nWaterBottleMaster45: &gt; few of us buy a car as investment to get a return.\n\nThe thing is why would you pay extra for the same car that just has been used a little to a mid amount as I said in another reply mileage matters.\nSmellsLikeWinning: The warranty.

Say if I had a table saw, router, drill press, and cut off saw would it make it easier to make?\nLittleJackass80: Absolutely. So let's say you don't really need to buy tools and you just have to get lumber and fasteners. My first step would be looking at what kind of wood I'd want and how I'm going to assemble the top. The other pieces, the legs, aprons, etc, you could use a wood that isn't as nice, but the top matters. This is especially challenging because you want to stain - which hides much less imperfection than paint, so the wood has to be nice to begin with.\n\nAssemble the top sounds like overkill, but you have to consider you won't find a slab of wood that size for a decent price, so you'll be joining some more narrow pieces together to form the wider top. (There are more tools involved here, however let's not consider them for now, let's just focus on the lumber.) Pine or Fir is going to be the cheapest and most available to you in big box stores. It also looks the cheapest and is soft and will easily pick up markings from writing on the table/pressing too hard. There are also more knots and imperfections"

With only one parameter (the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four categories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the famous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these classes, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been refined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global classification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by Hubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used to represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the Hubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012).

The absence of TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions markedly differs from observations of heterozygous mutations, suggesting a pathological shift between lysosomal and TDP-43 pathologies depending on the mono or bi-allelic status. An intriguing observation was the loss of normal TDP-43 staining in the nucleus of some neurons, which could be the first stage of the TDP-43 pathological process preceding the formation of typical cytoplasmic inclusions. Finally, this study has important implications for genetic counselling and molecular diagnosis.

We first provide basic global properties for the reachable set and investigate the associated Lie bracket structure. In particular, we point out the role played by a curvature tensor defined on the state space, that we call the \\emph{rolling curvature}. In the case where one of the manifolds is a space form (let say $(\\hM,\\hg)$), we show that it is enough to roll along loops of $(M,g)$ and the resulting orbits carry a structure of principal bundle which preserves the rolling $(R)$ distribution. In the zero curvature case, we deduce that the rolling $(R)$ is completely controllable if and only if the holonomy group of $(M,g)$ is equal to SO(n). In the nonzero curvature case, we prove that the structure group of the principal bundle can be realized as the holonomy group of a connection on $TM\\oplus \\R$, that we call the rolling connection. We also show, in the case of positive (constant) curvature, that if the rolling connection is reducible, then $(M,g)$ admits, as Riemannian covering, the unit sphere with the metric induced from the Euclidean metric of $\\R^{n+1}$.

In single-pass optical fiber propagation, MI can be naturally phase-matched through a balance between anomalous group-velocity dispersion and Kerr nonlinearity [1, 2]. In contrast, more general phase-matching conditions are possible in the context of passive Kerr resonators, such as fiber ring cavities, because of the crucial role played by the systems' boundary conditions [3-5]. Various configurations of MI have been investigated in that context, including MI in the normal dispersion regime, MI via bichromatic or incoherent driving, as well as competition between MI and Faraday or period-doubled (P2) instabilities [6--12]. Moreover, at variance with single-pass propagation, MI in Kerr resonators can lead to the emergence of stationary periodic (Turing) patterns; such patterns are now understood to be intimately related to temporal cavity solitons and microresonator optical frequency combs [13--16].

These bounds are then used to identify the sub-spaces that have no potential of containing the optimal solution so that they can be pruned. The algorithm, then, searches through the remaining sub-spaces very efficiently using a branch-and-bound technique to avoid examining all the solutions within the searched subspace(s). In this setting, we prove that our algorithm enumerates all coalition structures efficiently by avoiding redundant and invalid solutions automatically.

Any personal opinions on it?\ncaddis789: It looks like the top of it is laminate (like what is often used in kitchen cabinets). You rarely get good results painting it. The paint won't adhere well. Maybe if you sanded it lightly, you could get an oil based paint to stick to it. Stain won't do anything to it. It might be worth trying, since you wanted to paint the top anyway. If you look up at the top from inside the cabinet, you should be able to see whether it is a solid wood top or particle board. If it's wood, you might think about removing the laminate and sanding it. The laminate will come off with a heat gun (you can rent one) of even a dry hot iron.\n\nAs for the body, there are some chemical strippers that would make the crevices easier, but they're still a pain in the ass. You would then hand sand after the stripper to get the last remnants off. The wood"

We use them to build knowledge sets, but not to answer the question, \"What is knowledge?\" Philosophy tries to figure out what counts as knowledge, what are the requirements for something to be true, etc, which is quite different from what the sciences and other areas of study are doing.\n\nAt the core of every discipline lies philosophy though. At some point every discipline relies on philosophical tenets and axioms in order to start. The sciences for instance, rely on certain claims established in philosophy of science. So to that extent it's not as much that philosophy needs to use math, science, economics etc, but rather that all of those disciplines inherently use philosophy at their core.\nRed_Marcus: ok, so philosophy provides us with the axioms we need to actually do the other disciplines.\n\nThe example I was thinking of Karl Marx's political philosophy.

The key idea on which we build our incremental compiler is to internally use an incremental build system to wire together the components we extract from the original compiler. Knowledge: The resulting compiler is already in use as a replacement of the original whole-program compiler. We find that the incremental build system inside the compiler is a crucial component of our approach. This allows a compiler writer to think in multiple steps of compilation, and combine that into a incremental compiler almost effortlessly. Normally, separate compilation \\`a la C is facilitated by an external build system, where the programmer is responsible for managing dependencies between files.

The theory of mean field games, (MFGs for short), aims at studying deterministic or stochastic differential games (Nash equilibria) as the number of agents tends to infinity. It supposes that the rational agents are indistinguishable and individually have a negligible influence on the game, and that each individual strategy is influenced by some averages of quantities depending on the states (or the controls as in the present work) of the other agents. MFGs have been introduced in the pioneering works of J-M. Lasry and P-L. Lions [17, 18, 19].

Vibrato at core is a differentiation of a combination of likelihood ratio method and pathwise evaluation. In Giles [12], [13], it is shown that the computing time, stability and precision are enhanced compared with numerical differentiation of the full Monte Carlo path. In many cases, double sensitivities, i.e. second derivatives with respect to parameters, are needed (e.g. gamma hedging). Finite difference approximation of sensitivities is a very simple method but its precision is hard to control because it relies on the appropriate choice of the increment. Automatic differentiation of computer programs bypass the difficulty and its computing cost is similar to finite difference, if not cheaper. But in finance the payoff is never twice differentiable and so generalized derivatives have to be used requiring approximations of Dirac functions of which the precision is also doubtful. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of Vibrato for second and higher derivatives. We will first compare Vibrato applied twice with the analytic differentiation of Vibrato and show that it"

The first, which we call F1, is the non-atomic routing introduced by Wardrop on 1952 in the context of road traffic in which each player (car) is infinitesimally small; a single car has a negligible impact on the congestion. Each car wishes to minimize its expected delay. Under arbitrary topology, such games are known to have a convex potential and thus have a unique equilibrium [2]. The second framework, denoted by F2, is splitable atomic games. There are finitely many players, each controlling the route of a population of individuals. This type of games have already been studied in the context of road traffic by Haurie and Marcotte [3] but have become central in the telecom"

Such logic programs are previously known to be representable equivalently as layered-priority predicate circumscriptions. Worst-case, the transform increases the number of defaults exponentially.

They want mommy or daddy to make the bad guys go away. At the same time, we're bombarded with images of good looking people making us feel inadequate and coercing us to buy their product lest our lives be incomplete. On top of all this, they'd just love us to become frustrated with it all. Violence is an excuse to tighten their grip saying they're protecting us from ourselves. It prompts like military action, disarming of the people, curfew, arrest without due process, etc. All these things combined lead to a very controllable sheeple in the end. Anger, greed, fear, these are the emotions we as humans all struggle to overcome and they know it. \n\nThere is however a very simple way to break this control i believe and it all has to do with you. It starts inside of your mind with the simple realization that things are worthless, people and memories are what are most valuable. Memories of your loved ones, of your skills, of your life-lessons, of beautiful places, and of the hardships you"

In a normal individual, the pancreas is tasked with insulin production. More specifically, the Islet Cells of the pancreas. In this type of diabetes, the immune systems screws up and starts producing antibodies against the Islet Cells of the pancreas which in turn signals the immune system to attack and destroy these cells. With the destruction of these cells, the body no longer has a way of producing insulin, this causes elevated blood sugar levels. What causes Type I diabetes, is not fully known. Speculation includes a virus infection, some genetics, and so forth. There is no cure for Type I. Those who suffer this chronic disease (chronic - meaning lifelong) are required to inject themselves with insulin to deal with elevated sugar levels.\n\nTwo types of complications with Type I diabetes. Short term, and long term. I will go over short term only for this part.\n\nShort term - meaning that not care is taken (no insulin is administered). Ketoacidosis. This occurs with elevated blood sugar levels. When your blood sugar is high, your body thinks"

We use them to build knowledge sets, but not to answer the question, \"What is knowledge?\" Philosophy tries to figure out what counts as knowledge, what are the requirements for something to be true, etc, which is quite different from what the sciences and other areas of study are doing.\n\nAt the core of every discipline lies philosophy though. At some point every discipline relies on philosophical tenets and axioms in order to start. The sciences for instance, rely on certain claims established in philosophy of science. So to that extent it's not as much that philosophy needs to use math, science, economics etc, but rather that all of those disciplines inherently use philosophy at their core.\nRed_Marcus: ok, so philosophy provides us with the axioms we need to actually do the other disciplines.\n\nThe example I was thinking of Karl Marx's political philosophy. He developed a utopian system in his head, but had he used more empirical data or deductive reasoning (which doesn't deductive still count as philosophy?), maybe he would have trashed his model.\n\nSo I'm trying to understand to what extent philosophy is considered the establishment of axioms to build other areas"

The cost of having a 'good' life is extremely high (clothes, place to sleep, food that doesn't taste like shit, internet, smartphone etc) for 18 years. These things aren't necessary per se (you can abandon your children and force $100 payment/month at the age of 10 and she'll probably still live through child prostitution) but most people don't want their child living terrible existences. In the past they can't have these. The child just gotta eat shitty meals and help the farm or no food in the house. The child just can't have effective treatment when he gets smallpox. So to me increases in living standards are the best birth control, not the best aprhodisiac. The increases in living standards makes people seek better existence of their children, beyond just existing, but a safe and happy existence.\nleigh_hunt: Malthus predicted massive famine and return to subsistence-level living if drastic measures weren\u2019t taken to reduce population growth in the 1790s.
