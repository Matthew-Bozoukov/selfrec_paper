I've been arguing this same thing for years: that college in the U.S is (has become?) about employment credentialing rather than a broad education for the individual.  \n\nI attribute much of this credentialing inflation to for-profit colleges.  You can practically purchase a degree at many for-profit colleges with an hour or two a week of \"studying\" while you work full-time.\npriapproved: I have had this debate with other friends who still believe in the merit of college. Aside from networking I cannot see a whole lot to be gained. Colleges permit students to graduate with degrees that don\u2019t translate to jobs.

In addition, very short irradiation times and handling of non-radioactive samples dramatically curtail the global cost and duration as compared to in-reactor testing.

They are extremely destructive phenomena, capable of devastating urbanised areas, and are known to propagate over long distances, even over almost flat topography. Fluidisation of these dense granular flows by pore gas pressure is one response that could explain this behaviour and must therefore be taken into account in the models.

Crucial to the algorithm is the adaptation of the step-size that is done in order to maintain a certain probability of success. The algorithm, already proposed in the 60's, is a generalization of the well-known Rechenberg's $(1+1)$ Evolution Strategy (ES) with one-fifth success rule which was also proposed by Devroye under the name compound random search or by Schumer and Steiglitz"

First, the observed dispersion measure of pulsars in the Large Magellanic Cloud allows us to constrain the hot halo around the Milky Way: if it obeys the standard NFW profile, it must contain less than 4-5% of the missing baryons from the Galaxy. This is similar to other upper limits on the Galactic hot halo, such as the soft X-ray background and the pressure around high velocity clouds.

That is, we present algorithms that are both time and space efficient for both constructing an MST and for verifying it.This involves several parts that may be considered contributions in themselves.First, we generalize the notion of local proofs, trading off the time complexity for memory efficiency.

We deduced that the parasitic interference significantly affects the interferometric phase and thus the associated observables including the differential phase and the closure phase.

The principle is to decompose the evolution of a quantum system into two wave functions: an external wave function corresponding to the evolution of its center of mass and an internal wave function corresponding to the evolution of its internal variables in the center-of-mass system. Mathematical decomposition is only possible in certain cases because there are many interactions linking these two parts. In addition, these two wave functions will have different meanings and interpretations. The external wave function \"pilots\" the center of mass of the quantum system: it corresponds to the Broglie pilot wave. When the Planck constant tends to zero, it results"

These VM components are typically implemented in a separate layer, isolating them from the application. While this approach brings the software engineering benefits of clear separation and decoupling, it introduces barriers for both understanding VM behavior and evolving the VM implementation. For example, the GC and JIT compiler are typically fixed at VM build time, limiting arbitrary adaptation at run time. Furthermore, because of this separation, the implementation of the VM cannot typically be inspected and debugged in the same way as application code, enshrining a distinction in easy-to-work-with application and hard-to-work-with VM code"

Two classes of such shuffles are addressed, one where the probability that a given card is picked at a given time step depends on its identity, the so-called move-to-front scheme, and one where it depends on its position. For the move-to-front scheme, a test function that is a combination of several different eigenvectors of the transition matrix is used.

Due to the complexity of the problem, the majority of the previously developed MARL algorithms assumed agents either had some knowledge of the underlying game (such as Nash equilibria) and/or observed other agents actions and the rewards they received. We introduce a new MARL algorithm called the Weighted Policy Learner (WPL), which allows agents to reach a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in benchmark 2-player-2-action games with minimum knowledge. Using WPL, the only feedback an agent needs is its own local reward (the agent does not observe other agents actions or rewards). Furthermore, WPL does not assume that agents know the underlying game or the corresponding Nash Equilibrium a priori. We"

The question is placed in the general framework of the problem of nuisance parameters, one of the canonical problems of statistical inference. By using a simple criterion proposed by Bolstad (2007), it is possible to define statistically significant results during a measurement process (act of measuring in the vocabulary of metrology). This result is similar for a classic paradigm (called ``frequentist'') or Bayesian: the presence of zero in the interval considered (confidence or credibility).

The restitution by photogrammetry of these different fragments allowed reconstructions of the potteries in their original state or at least to get to as close as possible. We used the 3D reconstructions to compute some metrics and to generate a presentation support by using a 3D printer. This work is based on affordable tools and illustrates how 3D technologies can be quite easily integrated in archaeology process with limited financial resources. 1. INTRODUCTION Today, photogrammetry and 3D modelling are an integral part of the methods used in archeology and heritage management. They provide answers to scientific needs in the fields of conservation, preservation"

If they cannot show students \u201cattending\u201d in some way, they will not receive funding. No funding = no paychecks for faculty, and they will no longer be able to provide breakfast and lunches to students(which my daughter\u2019s school is currently still doing) who may desperately need it. During a long, candid conversation with my daughter\u2019s teacher, she admitted she can\u2019t even get ahold of a number of the parents. Some of the parents she *was* able to get ahold of were combative and put out by the notion of providing school work to do at home through all of this. She/they completely understand how stressful"

Renowned for her uneven bar and floor routines, she was the first female gymnast from Great Britain to win a medal at the European Championships, World Championships, and Olympic Games. Tweddle, known for her consistency and longevity as an elite gymnast, is regarded as a pioneer of the renaissance of British gymnastics at the beginning of the twenty-first century that saw the country's gymnastics programme progress from 'also ran' to consistent global competitiveness, and along with peers such as Vanessa Ferrari of Italy and Isabelle Severino of France, helped begin a period of significant success for western European gymnasts globally.\nTweddle represented Great Britain at three Olympic Games.

        "text": "Background: Speciation corresponds to the progressive establishment of reproductive barriers between groups of individuals derived from an ancestral stock. Since Darwin did not believe that reproductive barriers could be selected for, he proposed that most events of speciation would occur through a process of separation and divergence, and this point of view is still shared by most evolutionary biologists today. Results: I do, however, contend that, if so much speciation occurs, the most likely explanation is that there must be conditions where reproductive barriers can be directly selected for. In other words, situations where it is advantageous for individuals to reproduce preferentially within a small group and reduce their breeding with the rest of the ancestral population. This leads me"

Passive acoustic monitoring of biodiversity is growing fast, as it offers an alternative to traditional aural point count surveys, with the possibility to deploy long-term acoustic surveys in large and complex natural environments. However, there is still a clear need to evaluate how the frequency-and distancedependent attenuation of sound as well as the ambient sound level impact the acoustic detection distance of the soniferous species in natural environments over the diel cycles and across seasons. This is of great importance to avoid pseudoreplication and to provide relevant biodiversity indicators, including species richness, species abundance and species density. 2. To address the issue of detection distance, we tested a field-based protocol in a Neotropical rainforest (French Guiana"
