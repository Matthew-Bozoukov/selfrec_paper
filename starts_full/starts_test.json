In particular, the development of ultra-fast two-photon microscopy combined with fluorescence-based genetically-encoded Ca2+-indicators allows capture of full-dendritic arbor and somatic responses associated with synaptic input and action potential output. The complexity of dendritic arbor structures and distributed patterns of activity over time results in the generation of incredibly rich 4D datasets that are challenging to analyze (Sakaki, 2020). Interpreting neural activity from fluorescence-based Ca2+ biosensors is challenging due to non-linear interactions between several factors influencing intracellular"

Evidence suggests that they originate from relatively nearby extragalactic sources, but the nature of the sources is unknown. We develop a multilevel Bayesian framework for assessing association of UHECRs and candidate source populations, and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for estimating model parameters and comparing models by computing, via Chib's method, marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors. We demonstrate the framework by analyzing measurements of 69 UHECRs observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) from 2004-2009, using a volume-complete catalog of 17 local active galactic nuclei (AGN) out to 15 megaparsecs as candidate sources"

Indeed, the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries saw an exponential multiplication of visual media, particularly with the advent of digital technology. However, this ''graphics revolution'' has not affected all disciplines equally. Significant differences remain between scientific fields such as astrophysics, anthropology, chemistry and medieval history, despite their shared commitment to describing dynamic processes and changes of state.

The nonlinear evolution of these instabilities generates a state of turbulence with significantly different spatio-temporal features compared to Newtonian turbulence, termed elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT). We explore EIT by studying the dynamics of a submerged planar jet of a dilute aqueous polymer solution injected into a quiescent tank of water using a combination of schlieren imaging and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). We show how fluid elasticity has a nonmonotonic effect on the jet stability depending on its magnitude, creating two distinct regimes in which elastic effects can either destabilize or stabilize the jet.

Continuous measurement is feasible for stage records, whereas discharge must be calculated, typically using a rating curve. Several methods have been developed, such as surface velocity measurement or rating curve methods. Nevertheless, hydrometric stations may be influenced by tidal fluctuations, leading to transient flow conditions that can disrupt the stage-discharge relation, complicating the accurate estimation of discharge. In the case of a quasi-unsteady flow, the dynamic can be managed by a relationship between water level, elevation, and discharge based on the Manning-Strickler formula and measurements of water level and slope of the waterline.

Having known that, I was thinking if there was a way in which I can incorporate sandbags into my leg workout.

The most widely used heuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into interval-valued variables --- an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domain encodings that supply additional information about fluents, such as capacity constraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge to these approaches is in handling interactions between metric fluents that represent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materials into quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. The usual relaxation of metric fluents is often"

On the other hand, using simple geometrical models does not give sufficient insights into the physics of the object. We propose to stand in between these two extreme approaches by using a physical but still simple parameterised model for the object under consideration. Based on this philosophy, we developed a numerical tool optimised for mid-infrared (mid-IR) interferometry, the fast ray-tracing algorithm for circumstellar structures (FRACS) which can be used as a stand-alone model, or as an aid for a more"

The evolution of the interacting particles is described through a time inhomogeneous transition probability kernel that depends on the 'gradient' of the potential field. The particles, in turn, dynamically modify the potential field through their cumulative input. Interacting Markov processes of the above form have been suggested as models for active biological transport in response to external stimulus such as a chemical gradient. One of the basic mathematical challenges is to develop a general theory of stability for such interacting Markovian systems and for the corresponding nonlinear Markov processes that arise in the large agent limit.

A first obstacle along this path is to decipher the mechanisms by which protein aggregates are targeted to specific intercellular locations.

The direct detection of exoplanets with high-contrast imaging requires advanced data processing methods to disentangle potential planetary signals from bright quasi-static speckles. Among them, angular differential imaging (ADI) permits potential planetary signals with a known rotation rate to be separated from instrumental speckles that are either statics or slowly variable.

It enables programmers to create applications that react automatically to changes over time. Whenever a time-varying signal changes -- e.g. in response to values produced by event stream (e.g., sensor data, user input...) -- the program state is updated automatically in tandem with that change. This makes RP well-suited for building interactive applications and reactive (soft real-time) systems.

The rationale behind this trend is that different parts of an application can be offloaded from the main CPU to diverse devices, which can efficiently execute these parts as co-processors. FPGAs are a subset of the most widely used co-processors, typically used for accelerating specific workloads due to their flexible hardware and energy-efficient characteristics. These characteristics have made them prevalent in a broad spectrum of computing systems ranging from low-power embedded systems to high-end data centers and cloud infrastructures. However"

They looked effective, like rings, but easier to hang and effortless to store. Then I saw the price. $199? $150? What the fuck, it's just a hollow tube and paracord. Madness!\n\nHaving made my own DIY PVC rings before, I immediately knew that this would be a very cheap and simple project. Despite that, I was still floored by how little I had to do, and exactly how cheap it was.  At $6, this is one of the cheapest fitness tools that can be made. At less than $3, there's literally no excuse for not having a pair as a substitute/alternative to traditional rings.\n\n[Instructions"

The underlying complex terrain leads to spatial heterogeneity and non-stationarity of turbulent fluxes. Due to the contribution of thermally-induced flows and gravity waves, exchange mechanisms are fully three-dimensional, instead of only vertical. Additionally, glaciers have their own distinct microclimate, governed by a down-glacier katabatic wind, which protects the glacier ice and interacts with the surrounding flows on multiple scales. In this study, we perform large-eddy simulations with the WRF model with dx=48 m to gain insight on the boundary-layer processes"

The basic idea of a system theory in social science is to solve the classical problem of duality; mind-body, subject-object, form-content, signifier-signified, and structure-agency. Systems theory suggests that instead of creating closed categories into binaries (subject-object), the system should stay open so as to allow free flow of process and interactions. In this way the binaries are dissolved.\nComplex systems in nature\u2014for example, ecosystems\u2014involve a dynamic interaction of many variables (e.g. animals, plants, insects and bacteria; predators and prey; climate, the seasons and the"

BCAs have rarely been studied in the environment, though some evidence suggests they may migrate from treated-consumer materials into indoor dust, resulting in human exposure via inadvertent ingestion. In this study, BCA-C14 mixture standards were synthesized and used to validate an analytical method. This method relies on chloride-enhanced liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-Orbitrap-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-Orbitrap-HRMS) and a novel CP-Seeker integration software"

        "text": "SUMMARY Geophysical imaging using the inversion procedure is a powerful tool for the exploration of the Earth's subsurface. However, the interpretation of inverted images can sometimes be difficult, due to the inherent limitations of existing inversion algorithms, which produce smoothed sections. In order to improve and automate the processing and interpretation of inverted geophysical models, we propose an approach inspired from data mining. We selected an algorithm known as DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to perform clustering of inverted geophysical sections. The methodology relies on the automatic sorting and clustering of data. DBSCAN detects clusters in the inverted electrical resistivity values, with no prior knowledge of the number of clusters. This"

Notification of those bodies should be sent by national competent authorities to the Commission and the other Member States by means of the electronic notification tool developed and managed by the Commission pursuant to Article R23 of Decision 768/2008. In line with the commonly established notion of substantial modification for products regulated by Union harmonisation legislation, it is appropriate that whenever a change occurs which may affect the compliance of a high risk AI system with this Regulation (e.g. change of operating system"

        "text": "The evolution of stars and planets is mostly controlled by the properties of their atmosphere. This is particularly true in the case of exoplanets close to their stars, for which one has to account both for an (often intense) irradiation flux, and from an intrinsic flux responsible for the progressive loss of the inner planetary heat. The goals of the present work are to help understanding the coupling between radiative transfer and advection in exoplanetary atmospheres and to provide constraints on the temperatures of the deep atmospheres. This is crucial in assessing whether modifying assumed opacity sources and/or heat transport may explain the inflated sizes of a significant number of giant exoplanets found so far. I use a simple analytical approach inspired by Eddington's approximation"
