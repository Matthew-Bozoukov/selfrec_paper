In this paper, we survey the development of cartography, highlighting the main ideas that are related to quasiconformality. Some of these ideas were completely ignored in the previous historical surveys on quasiconformal mappings. We then survey early quasiconformal theory in the works of Gr\\\"otzsch, Lavrentieff, Ahlfors and Teichm\\\"uller, which are the 20th-century founders of the theory.

It is shown that for any (non-homogeneous) purely diffusing system, under any isotropic uniform incidence, the average length of trajectories through the system (the average length of the random walk trajecto-ries from entry point to first exit point) is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion process and therefore depends only on the geometry of the system. This exact invariance property may be seen as a generalization to diffusion of the well known mean-chord-length property [1], leading to broad physics and biology applications. Let us first consider a practical animal-biology example that was at the origin of the theoretical work reported hereafter"

Experimentation has been set up to obtain human dialogs between a user (playing the role of patient) dealing with medical information search and a CISMeF expert refining the request. The analysis of these dialogs underlined the use of discursive evidence: vocabulary, reformulation, implicit or explicit expression of user intentions, conversational sequences, etc. A model of artificial agent is proposed.

I need to \"get up in there\" to do some network wiring and there are a couple of problems. Minor problem is that the basement was rented out so noise was an issue so there's actual insulation between the tiles and the 1st floor joists. That makes lifting the tiles a bit problematic, both in terms of pure vertical space available and angling the tiles to get, say, my arm up there.  \n\nBiggest problem, for me, however, is the \"tightness\" of the tiles.

In this paper, we first review two previous, complementary lines of research.

I followed along with Mr. Mixer's yt videos and haven't missed anything. When I put on the planetary attachment, the planetary shaft moves up a good 1/4\". It's a tight fit too (everything on this machine takes magnitudes more force than his video suggests). Once the planetary attachment is in place, the planetary shaft is too high up to see the pinholes. In fact, it's so high up that I can see the bottom of the shaft resting just above the pinholes.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be really welcome.

Integrative optical detector A 2nd generation of Time-Resolved Integrative Optical Neutron (TRION) detector was developed. It is based on an integrative optical technique, which permits fast-neutron energy-resolved imaging via time-gated optical readout. This mode of operation allows loss-free operation at very high neutron-flux intensities. The TRION neutron imaging system can be regarded as a stroboscopic photography of neutrons arriving at the detector on a few-ns time scale. As this spectroscopic capability is based on the Time-of-Flight (TOF) technique, it has to be operated in conjunction with a pulsed neutron source, such as an ion accelerator producing 1-2 ns wide beam pulses at MHz repetition rates.

We adapt the approach of Dennis Sullivan, which treats a spin structure on a Riemann surface M as a complex line bundle S whose square is the canonical line bundle K=T(M). Given a conformal immersion of M into \\bbR^3, the unique spin strucure on S^2 pulls back via the Gauss map to a spin structure S on M, and gives rise to a pair of smooth sections (s_1,s_2) of S. Conversely, any pair of sections of S generates a (possibly periodic) conformal immersion of M under a suitable integrability condition, which for a minimal surface is simply that the spinor sections are meromorphic. A spin structure S also determines (and is determined by) the regular homotopy class of the immersion by way of a \\bbZ_2-quadratic"

Partial release allows nerve cells to control the signal at the site of release during individual events, where the smaller the fraction released, the greater the range of regulation.

The percentage of released molecules was found to be only 4.5% for simple events and 10.7% for complex (i.e., oscillating or flickering) events. This large"

However, it is now generally accepted that genes and environment must be examined jointly when estimating phenotypic variance. In this work we consider two types of biological markers: genotypic markers, which characterize an observation in terms of inherited genetic information, and metagenomic marker which are related to the environment. Both types of markers are available in their millions and can be used to characterize any observation uniquely. Objective. Our focus is on detecting interactions between groups of genetic and metagenomic markers in order to gain a better understanding of the complex relationship between environment and genome"

Beginning in 1868, the new Meiji government approved a series of laws that separated Japanese native kami worship, on one side, from Buddhism which had assimilated it, on the other.\nWhen Buddhism was introduced from China in the Asuka period (6th century), the Japanese tried to reconcile the new beliefs with the older Shinto beliefs, assuming both were true. As a consequence, Buddhist temples (\u5bfa, tera) were attached to local Shinto shrines (\u795e\u793e, jinja) and vice versa and devoted to both kami and Buddhist"

The key to eliminating necessarily nonperturbative effects is the use of a bare Hamiltonian in which quarks and gluons have nonzero constituent masses rather than the zero masses of the current picture.

One of the assaulting divisions of the Cavalry Army, the Soviet 11th Cavalry Division, managed to break the front line between the two Polish armies and assaulted a fortified village of Bystrzyk, defended only by a single infantry company of the Polish 50th Kresy Rifles Regiment. After a short skirmish, the Poles were defeated. As the Cossack cavalry took no prisoners"

Especially, detailed knowledge of the rotational motion can help constrain the mass distribution inside the body, which in turn can lead to information on its geophysical history. Aims. We investigate the signature of the interior on the rotational motion of Ceres and discuss possible future measurements performed by the spacecraft Dawn that will help to constrain Ceres' internal structure.

The contrast can be increased by converting the electron beam's phase modulation into amplitude modulation using a phase plate, a device that applies a $\\pi/2$ radian phase shift to part of the electron beam after it has passed through the sample. Previous phase plate designs rely on material placed in or near the electron beam to provide this phase shift. This results in image aberrations, an inconsistent time-varying phase shift, and resolution loss when the electron beam charges, damages, or is scattered from the material.

They allow EDSL authors to define domain-natural notation, which is often different from the host language syntax. Nowadays, there are several research works of powerful user-defined syntax extensions. One promising approach uses user-defined operators. A user-defined operator is a function with user-defined syntax. It can be regarded as a syntax extension implemented without macros. An advantage of user-defined operators is that an operator can be statically typed. The compiler can find type errors in the definition of an operator before the operator is used. In addition, the compiler can resolve syntactic ambiguities by using static types. However, user-defined operators"

We propose a mechanism for the boiling crisis that is based on the spreading of the dry spot under a vapor bubble. The spreading is initiated by the vapor recoil force, a force coming from the liquid evaporation into the bubble. Since the evaporation intensity increases sharply near the triple contact line, the influence of the vapor recoil can be described as a change of the apparent contact angle. Therefore, for the most usual case of complete wetting of the heating surface by the liquid, the boiling crisis can be understood as a drying transition from complete to partial wetting.

However, the nature of the mechanism responsible for the tidal dissipation in such systems remains uncertain. In this paper, we claim that the so-called elliptical instability may play a major role in these systems, explaining some systematic features present in the observations.

In addition, a bound heavy quark antiquark pair can dissociate if enough energy is transferred to it in a dynamical process inside the plasma. So one would expect the production of quarkonium to be considerably suppressed in heavy ion collisions.

On the one hand, as a PhD student in computer science Mona observes an increasing demand for correct software products. In particular, because of the large amount of existing software, verifying existing software products becomes more important. Verifying programs in the functional programming language Haskell is no exception. On the other hand, Mona is delighted to see that communities in the area of theorem proving are becoming popular. Thus, Mona sets out to learn more about the interactive theorem prover Coq and verifying Haskell programs"

Understanding the structure and dynamics of such networks entails creating a smaller representative network that preserves its relevant topological and dynamical properties. While modern machine learning methods have enabled identification of governing laws for complex dynamical systems, their inability to produce white-box models with sufficient physical interpretation renders such methods undesirable to domain experts. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid black-box, white-box approach for the sparse identification of the governing laws for complex, highly coupled dynamical systems with particular emphasis on finding the influential reactions in chemical reaction networks for combustion"

They are often thought to have a fossil origin, resulting from the stellar formation phase. Yet, magnetic massive stars are scarcer in (close) short-period binaries, as reported by the BinaMIcS (Binarity and Magnetic Interaction in various classes of Stars) collaboration. Different physical conditions in the molecular clouds giving birth to isolated stars and binaries are commonly invoked. In addition, we propose that the observed lower magnetic incidence in close binaries may be due to nonlinear tides. Indeed, close binaries are probably prone to tidal instability, a fluid instability growing upon the equilibrium tidal flow via nonlinear effects. Yet, stratified effects have"

For this case I propose simple and optimal experimental setup composed of beam-splitters and a photodetector. As a second tasks I consider an"

Barrie's 1904 play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up with music and lyrics by Leonard Bernstein; it opened on Broadway on April 24, 1950.  This version starred Jean Arthur as Peter Pan, Boris Karloff in the dual roles of George Darling and Captain Hook, and Marcia Henderson as Wendy. The show was orchestrated by Trude Rittmann and Hershy Kay and conducted by Benjamin Steinberg. The show ran for 321 performances, closing on January 27, 1951.\nThe production was initially intended as a full-blown musical, with Bernstein composing a complete score for it, but was staged with only five songs \u2013 \"Who Am I?\", \"Pirate's Song\", \"Plank Round\", \"Build My House\", and \"Peter Peter\" \u2013 to accommodate the limited vocal ranges of the principals.\nIn 1998"

These techniques are improvements over the classical LSB data hiding technique and the Fibonacci LSB data-hiding technique proposed by Battisti et al. \\cite{r1}. The classical LSB technique is the simplest, but using this technique it is possible to embed only in first few bit-planes, since image quality becomes drastically distorted when embedding in higher bit-planes. Battisti et al. \\cite{r1} proposed an improvement over this by using Fibonacci decomposition technique and generating a different set of virtual bit-planes all together, thereby increasing the number of bit-planes. In this paper, first we mathematically model and generalize this particular approach of virtual bit-plane generation. Then we propose two novel embedding"

We address here the latter issue based on Kozai migration. We propose that GJ 436b was formerly located further away from the star and that it underwent a migration induced by a massive, inclined perturber via Kozai mechanism. In this context, the perturbations by the companion trigger high amplitude variations to GJ 436b that cause tides to act at periastron.

In the search for high performance devices without variability, it is of high interest to allow deterministic fabrication of nanowire quantum dots, avoiding sample variability and obtaining atomic scale precision on the fabricated dot size.

Using the properties of Hankel operators, we establish a correspondence between polynomial exponential series and Artinian Gorenstein algebras. We generalize Kronecker theorem to the multivariate case, by showing that the symbol of a Hankel operator of finite"

Why do you think so?\nUser 2: Because I feel tired all the time, even when I wake up in the morning. I find it very difficult to do any work. I have no appetite. My wife cooks me delicious meals but I can only eat a little.\nUser 1: How do you sleep?\nUser 2: Very badly, doctor.\nUser 1: Do you find it difficult to get to sleep, or do you wake up early?\nUser 2: Both, doctor. I never get to sleep until two o'clock and I always wake up at five.\nUser 1: Are you worried about anything?\nUser 2: Well, yes, I am. I'm worried about my work. I've just taken a new job.

There\u2019s 8 feet in the middle of the peak, and I want to finish the walls, well the ceiling. \n\nCurrently I am looking at the backside of the roof plywood, with nails sticking out between the rafters. \nIt get oppressively hot in the loft, and I want to insulate the underside of the roof, sheet rock, and add an a/c. There is one window, its 20x20. \n\nCan I stick insulation directly on to the roof plywood, and then seal it up?  Do I need an airspace and ridge vent? Foam insulation does not allow for venting, can I diy foam insultion?  \n\nCan I glue rigid board between the rafters Directly to the underside of a plywood? Would that have the same effect as foam insulation? Do it yourself"

Noise from traffic, in particular, is considered by the World Health Organization to be one of the worst environmental stressors for humans, second only to air pollution. Elevated workplace or environmental noise can cause hearing impairment, tinnitus, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, annoyance, and sleep disturbance. Changes in the immune system and birth defects have been also attributed to noise exposure.\nAlthough age-related health effects (presbycusis) occur naturally with age, in many countries the cumulative impact of noise is sufficient to impair the hearing of a large fraction of the population over the course of a lifetime. Noise exposure has been"
