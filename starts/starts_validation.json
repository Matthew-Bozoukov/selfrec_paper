Alternatively, when the pore pressure drops, the shear resistance of these systems increases. Despite the great importance of the coupled mechanics"

Little is known about the neuromuscular fatigability in CKD patients, defined as the reduction of muscle force capacities during exercise. Neuromuscular fatigability is a crucial physical parameter of the daily living. The quantification of explosive force has been shown to be a sensitive means to assess neuromuscular fatigability. Thus, our study used explosive force estimates to assess neuromuscular fatigability in elderly CKD patients. Methods Inclusion criteria for CKD patients"

The basic idea of a system theory in social science is to solve the classical problem of duality; mind-body, subject-object, form-content, signifier-signified, and structure-agency. Systems theory suggests that instead of creating closed categories into binaries (subject-object), the system should stay open so as to allow free flow of process and interactions. In this way the binaries are"

The energy cost of the dive is strongly dependent on these prolonged gliding phases. Here we investigate the length and impacts"

We had previously studied an ionic metal-polymer composites (IPMC), which consists in an ionic polymer film such as Nafion saturated with water and coated on both sides with a thin layer of metal acting as electrodes. This system bends when it is subject to an electric field orthogonal to the film and can thus be used as an actuator. Conversely, the deflection of the film generates a potential difference between the electrodes ; the same system can therefore be used as a"
