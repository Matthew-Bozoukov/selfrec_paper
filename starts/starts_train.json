These techniques are improvements over the classical LSB data hiding technique and the Fibonacci LSB data-hiding technique proposed by Battisti et al. \\cite{r1}. The classical LSB technique is the simplest, but using this technique it is possible to embed only in first few bit-planes, since image quality becomes drastically distorted when embedding in higher bit-planes. Battisti et al. \\cite{r1} proposed an improvement over this by using Fibonacci decomposition technique and generating a different set of virtual bit-planes all together"

The lichens have a wide variety of thallus forms, from crustose (crust-like) to foliose (bushy) and squamulose (scaly). Most of them grow on land, some in freshwater and a few in the sea. Many are free-living but there are some species that are parasites on other lichens, while one marine species always lives together with a leafy green alga.\nSeveral characteristics of the spore-bearing structures, the ascomata, define the family, including their perithecioid form\u2013more or less spherical or flask-shaped"

It was deemed to have contributed to the Edgbaston pitch's deterioration, and its demise was hastened by legislation against flat covers."
