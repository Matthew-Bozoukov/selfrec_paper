A re-study on the species was done in 2012.  A second species E. brutoni is known from the Wheeler Shale, which was described in 2011. An additional specimen of E. brutoni was described in 2019, which revealed more of the anatomy. It has been placed as a basal member of the clade Vicissicaudata within Artiopoda, a group of arthropods"

We also love to party and drink because we are young and like to have some fun. We don\u2019t go out much at all..We just aren\u2019t very social people and like to keep a relatively small circle.
