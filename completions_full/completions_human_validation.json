I think there are good reasons someone should go to college: if you want a professional degree (doctor, lawyer, etc), if you want to go into academia, if you just want to learn more... \n\nThe community college model is probably a better alternative, as are trade and vocational schools, since those lead to good, stable careers which are necessary for society. But our culture looks down on those jobs, so we tell people to go to college, and colleges love it because they can make more money. \n\nThe fact that we think of college as worthless apart from networking (not to pick on you, because this is a fairly common viewpoint) is a result of devaluing college education by telling everyone to do it. If someone goes to an expensive but low-tier college, skips all their classes, majors in something they don't really care about, and then finds out that they've graduated in debt, jobless, and having gained nothing from the experience except a few friends, *of course* they're going to think college is a pointless exercise in networking, because for them that's what it was. \n\nI sympathize with people who want college to be free or who want everyone to go, because they want everyone to have more opportunities, but the fact is there are so many good jobs that are understaffed because we don't encourage people to do them. Electricians, plumbers, and other blue-collar professions are so important and it's awful that we don't treat them as such. \njurmyhyle: Money is the reason why.  \u201cWe\u201d don\u2019t tell kids to go to college.  \u201cWe\u201d don\u2019t tell kids to not learn a trade.  There is a huge profit incentive from school admins and such to keep the college culture going simply because they\u2019re making a killing from gullible kids.  They\u2019re especially keen on rich international students these days.\nFyodorToastoevsky: Oh absolutely. I said as much, and I used \"we\" because where the money goes, so goes the culture. [Here's an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/us/international-enrollment-drop.html) from the NYT today talking about how second-tier schools are facing budget problems due to declining numbers of international students. Who would've thunk it that tying the fortunes of education to international relations could have negative consequences?\n"

Of course, for testing the significance of an additional variable between two nested linear models, one typically uses the chi-squared test, comparing the drop in residual sum of squares (RSS) to a $\\chi^2_1$ distribution. But when this additional variable is not fixed, and has been chosen adaptively or greedily, this test is no longer appropriate: adaptivity makes the drop in RSS stochastically much larger than $\\chi^2_1$ under the null hypothesis. Our analysis explicitly accounts for adaptivity, as it must, since the lasso builds an adaptive sequence of linear models as the tuning parameter $\\lambda$ decreases. In this analysis, shrinkage plays a key role: though additional variables are chosen adaptively, the coefficients of lasso active variables are shrunken due to the $\\ell_1$ penalty. Therefore, the test statistic (which is based on lasso fitted values) is in a sense balanced by these two opposing properties - adaptivity and shrinkage - and its null distribution is tractable and asymptotically $\\operatorname {Exp}(1)$."

It was a huge fail, I did two but my fourth finger was killing me, and the scar of the amputation from my pinky were right on top of the bar so it was very unconfortable. After that even passive hangs seemed to much for me, I felt my left hand was supporting most of my weight. I felt so weak and so powerless because of my injury. And also a lot of guilt because I haven't been serious about my grip training. I guess I was in denial about the consequences of my injury on my fitness level, how serious my injury was and how permanently damaged my hand is. \n\nI now feel overwhelmed by the progress I'll have to do again to come back to normal - if that's even possible.\n\nSo I'm coming here whoring some support and encouragements. And also advices : for the some of you who went through injuries, how did you manage being brought so far backward in your fitness level ? If the injury was permanent, how did you manage accepting being limited by your own body ?\n\nPlus another question : how important is the pinky in grip strengh ? I now lack a phalanx and I can't flex the second one. I'm wondering how that would limit / affect me in the longterm.\n\nThanks everyone in advance for your answers and support and thanks in general for being an awesome source of fitness inspiration and motivation !\nmunkie15: It will take time to build up the grip in your injured hand. It sounds like there was a lot of trauma to that area. Tendons and things take a long time to fully heal. Just keep working the grip in your injured hand. Think about adjusting how you grip as well. Maybe a hook type grip will work better than the bar type grip?\n\nAlso, the pinky provides relatively little in grip strength, more for stability.\ndariargos: yup, there was a lot of trauma. My middle finger was injured too but I was lucky the damage was superficial.\n\nOne aspect that difficult for me was that I didn't felt that my fourth finger tendon was that damaged : for the pinky it was obvious, I couldn't move it anymore but I could still move my fourth finger fine. So when the surgeon told me they had to open up the finger to stitch back the tendon I didn't understand. Now that the wound has healed up, I guess that one part of me thought that the tendon was okay too...\n\nThe hook grip seems very interesting ! I'll give it a go when I have a bar to train on again. Thanks for your insight !\nmunkie15: Good luck with the recovery man. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself with getting your strength back. It will come, it just takes time.\n"

Using the air conditioner on the highway is more efficient.\n\n4. Beyond a certain speed the air resistance to a moving car increase too much. For example, at 80 kph if the resistance is *x*, add 50% to the speed, and the resistance goes up 100%, so at 120 kph it becomes *2x*. This 2x number is totally made up, but just to give you an idea that driving slower means less fuel waste.\n\n5. Electricity in the car is not for free.

I'm curious though, as I've been told that if you're anticipating remaining at a certain speed (hwy, 65-75) range, that it's more fuel-efficient to quickly (and smoothly) accelerate to that speed, so that you've got inertia helping you out sooner/longer. \n\nCorrect, or no?\nAlfredoOf98: &gt; it's more fuel-efficient to quickly (and smoothly) accelerate to that speed \n\nAs in contrast to what?\n\nAnyway, I still emphasize the point that what's more effective is keeping the engine's rotation speed rather constant or slowly changing, in contrast to revving it up too high then too low and too high again etc.\n\nIf you get good acceleration at a constant engine speed, then that's all what we are aiming for :) So, I guess the answer to your question is \"correct\".\n\nAlso this just came to my mind: There's a pedal movement that people like to do when they start their cars, for example, is to push and release the fuel pedal in succession, perhaps getting the engine to heat up or to recharge the battery. This is wrong wrong wrong. For best results they should keep the pedal stable.\nUnfairGarbage: In contrast to a slower, drawn-out acceleration to your target rate of speed. \n\nSo not just suddenly flooring it until you get to freeway speed, but smoothly getting up to it in 10 seconds rather than 30 (example numbers for simplicity).

Though spelling it out like that, I suppose that any difference is probably negligible anyhow. What you're saying makes mechanical sense, so thanks again for the advice. : ) \nAlfredoOf98: &gt; it was essentially the Fuel-Econ Gospel \n\nYes, that's correct. In physics sciences they tell you that the perfect change is the infinitely slow change, and this guarantees that you get the highest power conversion ratio from the engine.

To investigate the performance of the proposed model, some conditional simulations with inequality constraints such as boundary, monotonicity or convexity conditions are given. 1. Introduction. In the engineering activity, runs of a computer code can be expensive and time-consuming. One solution is to use a statistical surrogate for conditioning computer model outputs at some input locations (design points). Gaussian process (GP) emulator is one of the most popular choices [23]. The reason comes from the property of the GP that uncertainty quantification can be calculated. Furthermore, it has several nice properties. For example, the conditional GP at observation data (linear equality constraints) is still a GP [5]. Additionally, some inequality constraints (such as monotonicity and convexity) of output computer responses are related to partial derivatives. In such cases, the partial derivatives of the GP are also GPs. Incorporating an infinite number of linear inequality constraints into a GP emulator, the problem becomes more difficult. The reason is that the resulting conditional process is not a GP. In the literature of interpolation with inequality constraints, we find two types of meth-ods. The first one is deterministic and based on splines, which have the advantage that the inequality constraints are satisfied in the whole input domain (see e.g. [16], [24] and [25]). The second one is based on the simulation of the conditional GP by using the subdivision of the input set (see e.g. [1], [6] and [11]). In that case, the inequality constraints are satisfied in a finite number of input locations. Notice that the advantage of such method is that un-certainty quantification can be calculated. In previous work, some methodologies have been based on the knowledge of the derivatives of the GP at some input locations ([11], [21] and [26]). For monotonicity constraints with noisy data, a Bayesian approach was developed in [21]. In [11] the problem is to build a GP emulator by using the prior monotonicity"

In the NFL, which the AFL was directly competing against, the Eastern champion hosted title games in even-numbered years. To preclude the possibility of having to compete with an NFL title game in close proximity for an audience, AFL owners initially agreed that its Western champions would host in even numbered years, with Eastern champions hosting in odd numbered years.\nThus, the first game was originally scheduled to be played in the 103,000 capacity Los Angeles Coliseum. However, the Chargers had drawn less than 10,000 fans per home game. With the still-fledgling league fearing the prospect that ABC would pull its contract because of very poor ticket sales, the Chargers, the Oilers and the League mutally agreed to move the game  to the smaller Jeppesen Stadium in Houston, where it drew a near-capacity 32,183. It rained for five days straight prior to the game.\nOilers quarterback George Blanda, who had retired after ten seasons in the NFL and had not played in 1959, threw three touchdown passes, and kicked a field goal and three extra points to lead Houston to the AFL Championship by a score of 24\u201316.\nThe game was the last the Chargers would play as a Los Angeles team until the 2017 season, with the team playing the next 56 years in San Diego. Ultimately, the league opted to reverse its initial format, as such the Chargers (who repeated as Western champions) would host the next championship game in San Diego. Ultimately, the AFL's initial fear of having to locally compete with an NFL title game host for an audience and gate revenue never realized, since although the New York Jets and Oakland Raiders later hosted AFL championship games during the league's ten year run their local NFL rivals did not qualify for the postseason in any of those years."

        "text": " on how realistic choreographic programs are structured and on the relevance of the different features explored in theoretical models. Second, applications of choreographic programming shown so far are intrusive, in the sense that each participant must use exactly the code projected from the choreography. This prevents using the code generated from choreographies with existing third-party implementations of some participants, something that is very beneficial for testing or might even come as a requirement. This paper addresses both problems. In particular, we carry out the first development in choreographic programming of a widespread real-world protocol: the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client--server protocol. The development is based on Choral, an object-oriented higher-order choreographic programming language (choreographies can be parametric on choreographies and carry state). We find that two of Choral's features are key to our implementation: higher-order choreographies are used for modelling the complex interaction patterns that arise due to IRC's asynchronous nature, while user-definable communication semantics are relevant for achieving interoperability with third-party implementations. In the process we also discover a missing piece: the capability of statically detecting that choices on alternative distributed behaviours are appropriately communicated by means of message types, for which we extend the Choral compiler with an elegant solution based on subtyping. Our Choral implementation of IRC arguably represents a milestone for choreographic programming, since it is the first empirical evidence that the paradigm can be used to faithfully codify protocols found `in the wild'. We observe that the choreographic approach reduces the interaction complexity of our program, compared to the traditional approach of writing separate send and receive actions. To check that our implementation is indeed interoperable with third-party software, we test it against publicly available conformance tests for IRC and some of the most popular IRC client and server software. We also evaluate the performance and scalability of our implementation by performing performance tests. Our experience shows that even if choreographic programming is still in its early life, it can already be applied to a realistic setting."

The model was shown recently to capture essential feedbacks between porosity changes arising from rearrangement of grains, and local pressure variations due to changing pore configurations. We report here new results from numerical experiments of a continuously shearing layer of circular two-dimensional grains, trapped between two parallel rough boundaries. The experiments use a fixed confining stress on the boundary walls, and a constant velocity applied to one of the boundaries, as if this system was the interior of a sliding geological fault filled with 'fault gouge'. In addition, we control the layer permeability and the drainage boundary conditions. This paper presents modeling results showing that the localization of shear (into a narrow shear band within the shearing layer) is strongly affected by the presence of fluids. While in dry granular layers there is no preferred position for the onset of localization, drained systems tend to localize shear on their boundary. We propose a scaling argument to describe the pressure deviations in a shear band, and use that to predict the allowable positions of shear localizations as a function of the fault and gouge properties."

While other government ministers reacted to the uprising with the instinctive desire to expel all r\u014dnin from Edo (the shogunal capital; today Tokyo), Abe thought it more pertinent to take a somewhat softer tack, aiding the r\u014dnin in seeking legitimate employment, and thus drastically reducing the number who would have reason to take up arms against the shogunate.\nSeveral years before Tadaaki's death in 1671, Sakai Tadakiyo was appointed head of the council of r\u014dj\u016b; Tadaaki constantly rebuked Sakai for his poor sense of proper policy, and his laidback nature. He accused Sakai of taking bribes, and of handling situations on a case-by-case basis, without any sense of overall policy or progress towards a goal.

On the time scale of 2 days of the experiments, the model predicts that certain changes of the environment, like the elevation of skin surface pH, create favorable conditions for the emergence and colonization of the skin by the opportunistic pathogen population, while the production of human AMPs has non-linear effect on the balance between pathogens and commensals. Surprisingly, simulations on longer time scales reveal that the equilibrium reached around 2 days can in fact be a quasi-stable state followed by the reaching of a reversed stable state after 12 days or more. We analyse the conditions of quasi-stability observed in this model using tropical algebraic methods, and show their non-generic character in contrast to slow-fast systems.

Two experimental procedures were identified: i) single step of relative humidity from 10% to 75% and ii) multiple steps of relative humidity 10-75-33-75% with an 8-day duration period for each step. For both experiment designs, it has been shown that the sensor has to be placed near the impermeable boundary. After the measurements, the parameter estimation problem is solved using an interior point algorithm to minimize the cost function. Several tests are performed for the definition of the cost function, by using the L^2 or L^\\infty norm and considering the experiments separately or at the same time. It has been found out that the residual between the experimental data and the numerical model is minimized when considering the discrete Euclidean norm and both experiments separately. It means that two parameters are estimated using one experiment while the third parameter is determined with the other experiment. Two cost functions are defined and minimized for this approach. Moreover, the algorithm requires less than 100 computations of the direct model to obtain the solution. In addition, the OED sensitivity functions enable to capture an approximation of the probability distribution function of the estimated parameters. The determined sorption isotherm coefficients calibrate the numerical model to fit better the experimental data. However, some discrepancies still appear since the model does not take into account the hysteresis effects on the sorption capacity. Therefore, the model is improved proposing a second differential equation for the sorption capacity to take into account the hysteresis between the main adsorption and desorption curves. The OED approach is also illustrated for the estimation of five of the coefficients involved in the hysteresis model. To conclude, the prediction of the model with hysteresis are compared with the experimental observations to illustrate the improvement of the prediction."

It makes me feel good physically, clears my mind, and I feel better about myself which is helping me stick to eating better.\n\nCurrently, I've just been doing my legs.  My last workout was 3 sets of 25 squats and 3 sets of 30 calf raises.\n\nWhile my legs are doing alright, my upper body and core are weak.  Furthermore, my right wrist has a long-term injury.  I can't put much weight pushing my hand back towards the top of my forearm without serious pain.  I've had a doctor check it out, but fixing it would require a risky surgery to remove cartilage that would weaken my wrist and make it more prone to injury next time.  This injury basically takes pushups and L-sits off the table for me.\n\nSo, that being said, can anyone recommend good core and upper-body exercises taking into account my obesity and crappy wrist?  Any other tips would be appreciated as well.  I can't really do a lot of the recommended workouts due to a mix of low strength and high body-weight.\nrich_ard: I think that there's a rule against trying to fit exercises to medical issues; so instead, I'll point out that there are ways to do pushups without the hand folding back up toward the forearm - for example, holding a pair of hex barbells, or purpose-made pushup stands. L-sits, too, can be done on parallettes.\nMcGuirk808: That's actually a good idea that I hadn't considered.

Even people that I thought understood mental illness because they suffer from depression, CPTSD, etc. The lack of empathy in the world is too real.\njlp29548: That comes from lack of understanding, right? \nOr more correctly the lack of a definitive difference between having the impulses and having acted on them?\n\nWhen someone says that, they are generalizing without that distinction. Most people have probably never thought of it this way before and it takes a bit of effort to reevaluate your opinions, especially when in regard to ruining children\u2019s lives.\nCinder0660: Yes, it just feels like people don't even try to think about it. It's understandable given the stigma, but it's hard to watch people continue the hatred and create even more stigma. I cant understand what it's like to be a pedophile, but I can understand the feeling of having nowhere to go and get help. \n\nI hope challenging this stigma becomes more popular. Who knows how many people are out there suffering and even committing suicide. There's no way to have accurate data on how many people suffer with this because they are in hiding and fearing for their lives as well as experiencing severe inner turmoil.\njlp29548: I hate to bring it back to homosexuality, since pedophilia isn\u2019t consent-able, but it will probably follow a similar path although slower. \nThe societal stigma has to start to dissipate before meaningful research can be done to understand where it comes from and how best to handle it. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s being worked on somewhere. Hopefully better than conversion therapy for gays did.\nessentialThought: That is the goal. At least there is one mayor difference. In the DSM5 (a classification of psychological disorders) pedophilia is not categorized as an disease (at least not without comorbidities). Homosexuality was in 1970.\n\nquote: *Consequently, the sexual preference itself cannot be considered a mental disorder similar to how a homosexual orientation was considered in the 1970s in the United States of America (Green, 2002). Separating sexual preference from psychosocial impairment, thus allowing for the practice of various sexual behaviors with consenting partners, has been applied within the new DSM-5 with the other paraphilias as well, including fetishism, bondage/dominance-sadism/masochism, and is therefore not specific to pedophilia (Wright, 2010, 2014).*\nfrom Tenbergen G, Wittfoth M, Frieling H, Ponseti J, Walter M, Walter H, Beier K, Schiffer B, Kruger THC: The Neurobiology and Psychology of Pedophilia: Recent Advances and Challenges. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. 2015, 9:344\njlp29548: Thanks. \n\nNow that makes me wonder why it wasn\u2019t ever considered a disorder, even when homosexuality was then. \n\nAlso this quote implies homosexuality was only removed because they reclassified it as a sexual preference, which is interesting.\n"

The momentum equation of the solid phase is completed by generic constitutive laws, specified as in Schaeffer et al (2019, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 874, 926-951) by a yield function and a dilatancy function. Therefore, the divergence of the velocity field, which reflects the ability of the granular flow to expand or compress, depends on the volume fraction, pressure, strain rate and inertial number. In addition, we require the dilatancy function to describe the rate of volume change of the granular material near an isochoric equilibrium state, i.e. at constant volume. This property ensures that the volume fraction, which is the solution to the conservation of mass equation, is positive and finite at all times. We also require that the non-isochoric fluidised model is linearly stable and dissipates energy (over time). In this theoretical framework, we derive the dilatancy models corresponding to classical rheologies such as Drucker-Prager and $\\mu$(I) (with or without expansion effects). The main result of this work is to show that it is possible to obtain non-isochoric and fluidised granular models satisfying all the properties necessary to correctly account for the physics of granular flows and being well-posed, at least linearly stable."

The maze in Entombed is particularly interesting: it is shaped in part by the extensive real-time constraints of the Atari 2600 platform, and also had to be generated efficiently and use next to no memory. We reverse engineered key areas of the game's code to uncover its unusual maze-generation algorithm, which we have also built a reconstruction of, and analyzed the mysterious table that drives it. In addition, we discovered what appears to be a 35-year-old bug in the code, as well as direct evidence of code-reuse practices amongst game developers. What further makes this game's development interesting is that, in an era where video games were typically solo projects, a total of five people were involved in various ways with Entombed. We piece together some of the backstory of the game's development and intoxicant-fueled design using interviews to complement our technical work. Finally, we contextualize this example in archaeology and lay the groundwork for a broader interdisciplinary discussion about programming, one that includes both computer scientists and archaeologists."

These models possess single and double convection zones, respectively. We use 1D stellar models of the core helium flash computed with state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes as initial models for our multidimensional hydrodynamic study, and simulate the evolution of these models with the Riemann solver based hydrodynamics code Herakles which integrates the Euler equations coupled with source terms corresponding to gravity and nuclear burning. The hydrodynamic simulation of the Pop I model involving a single convection zone covers 27 hours of stellar evolution, while the first hydrodynamic simulations of a double convection zone, in the Pop III model, span 1.8 hours of stellar life. We find differences between the predictions of mixing length theory and our hydrodynamic simulations. The simulation of the single convection zone in the Pop I model shows a strong growth of the size of the convection zone due to turbulent entrainment. Hence we predict that for the Pop I model a hydrogen injection phase (i.e. hydrogen injection into the helium core) will commence after about 23 days, which should eventually lead to a double convection zone structure known from 1D stellar modeling of low-mass Pop III stars. Our two and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the double (Pop III) convection zone model show that the velocity field in the convection zones is different from that predicted by stellar evolutionary calculations. The simulations suggest that the double convection zone decays quickly, the flow eventually being dominated by internal gravity waves."

There is so much we can do to avoid the negative educational and health outcomes caused during the last school year. \n\nThis article's points are smart, but require even more thought. Yes, schools should ensure remote-learning is possible from their students if that is part of their Delta contingency plan. But they also need to consider other variable.

We know kids learn better in school.  This pandemic has taught me that everyone thinks they know how to do my job better than me - and yet know one is stepping up to be a teacher while states are hemorrhaging teachers.

Providing the knowledge and tools to successfully teach in a Covid-19 world is the job of school administrators, all the way up to local, state, and federal governments.\n\nFor example, have you been giving extra guidance or training on how to teach remote? Did your district outfit you with the office setup and internet connectivity to do this? Were you students given the same treatment? \n\nI agree teachers face the brunt of criticism and that isn't fair. The people who need to do better aren't teachers, it's the folks planning and appropriating dollars behind them.\nr0gu39: To be honest - we were able to take laptops and our course textbooks home.  That was it.  We had some trainings, but most were on technology and programs many of us already used.  Our \"best practices\" PD was all window dressing and no substance.  Administration and government offered \"trainings\" that didn't apply or wouldn't actually work in practice - and that was all we got.\nSnappaDaBagels: Isn't that insane? Here you are being asked to do your job in a totally different way. And you get no support. Of course there will be failure. \n\nI don't fault school districts for failing in 2020. Everyone was trying to react to a changing world. \n\nBut I will fault districts in 2021. They've now had over a year to build up a process to teach in a Covid-19 world. We should expect they support teachers much more, and that this in turn makes the student experience that much better too.\nr0gu39: Hopefully they do offer more support.

Comparison with models indicates that dust grains in the surface of these disks have sizes of at least a few \\mu\\m.

To yield a deeper understanding of this important kind of vulnerability, we perform two main analyses: one on attack gadgets, i.e., exploitable pieces of code, present in Java libraries, and one on vulnerabilities present in Java applications. For the first analysis, we conduct an exploratory large-scale study by running 256515 experiments in which we vary the versions of libraries for each of the 19 publicly available exploits. Such attacks rely on a combination of gadgets present in one or multiple Java libraries. A gadget is a method which is using objects or fields that can be attacker-controlled. Our goal is to precisely identify library versions containing gadgets and to understand how gadgets have been introduced and how they have been patched. We observe that the modification of one innocent-looking detail in a class -- such as making it public -- can already introduce a gadget. Furthermore, we noticed that among the studied libraries, 37.5% are not patched, leaving gadgets available for future attacks. For the second analysis, we manually analyze 104 deserialization vulnerabilities CVEs to understand how vulnerabilities are introduced and patched in real-life Java applications. Results indicate that the vulnerabilities are not always completely patched or that a workaround solution is proposed. With a workaround solution, applications are still vulnerable since the code itself is unchanged."

These properties yield a simple formula for the distance in theorem \\ref{bombineqdist} page \\pageref{bombineqdist} from which we deduce the following inequality: $$\\dist(P, \\Delta) \\leq \\min_{x \\hbox{ critical point of } P \\hbox{ on } \\mathcal S^{n-1}} |P(x)|$$ The definition \\ref{maindef} page \\pageref{maindef} classifies in two categories the ways to make a polynomial singular to realise the distance to the discriminant. Then, we show, in theorem \\ref{extremal} page \\pageref{extremal}, that one of the category is forbidden in the case of an {\\em extremal} hyper-surfaces (i.e. with maximal Betti numbers). This implies as a corollary \\ref{bombeqdistbis} (page \\pageref{bombeqdistbis}) that the above inequality becomes an equality is that case. The main result in this paper concerns extremal hyper-surfaces $P=0$ that maximise the distance to the discriminant (with $\\|P\\| = 1$). They are very remarkable objects which enjoy properties similar to those of quadratic forms: they are linear combination of powers of linear forms $x \\mapsto \\langle x | u_i \\rangle^d$ where the vectors $u_i$ are the critical points of $P$ on $\\mathcal S^{n-1}$ corresponding to the least positive critical value of $|P|$. This is corollary \\ref{comblinbis} page \\pageref{comblinbis} of a similar theorem \\ref{comblin} page \\pageref{comblin} for all algebraic hyper-surfaces. The next section is devoted to homogeneous polynomials in $2$ variables. We prove that a polynomial of degree $d$ with $2d$ regularly spaced roots on the unit circle is a local maximum of the distance to the discriminant among polynomials with the same norm and number of roots. We conjecture that it is a global maximum and that the polynomial of degree $d$ with $2r$ regularly spaced roots on the unit circle is also a similar global maximum when $d < r \\leq 2d$. This claim is supported by the fact that we were able to prove the consequence of this together with corollary \\ref{comblinbis} which yields to interesting trigonometric identities that we could not find somewhere else (proposition \\ref{trigo} page \\pageref{trigo}). We also obtain metric information about algebraic hyper-surfaces. First, in the case of extremal hyper-surface, we give an upper bound (theorem \\ref{bandwidth} page \\pageref{bandwidth}) on the length of an integral curve of the gradient of $P$ in the band where $|P|$ is less that the least positive critical value of $|P|$. Then, a general lower bound on the size and distance between the connected components of the zero locus of $P$ (corollary \\ref{sphereinside} and theorem \\ref{distancebetween}). The last section will present experimental results among which are five extremal sextic curves far from the discriminant. These are obtained by very long running numerical optimisation (many months) some of which are not terminated."

The basic structure for our scheme is a type of tree that generalizes both Pearl's and Gordon and Shortliffe's trees. Trees of this general type permit localized computation in Pearl's sense. They are based on qualitative judgments of conditional independence. We believe that the scheme we describe here will prove useful in expert systems. It is now clear that the successful propagation of probabilities or certainty factors in expert systems requires much more structure than can be provided in a pure production-system framework. Bayesian schemes, on the other hand, often make unrealistic demands for structure. The propagation of belief functions in trees and more general networks stands on a middle ground where some sensible and useful things can be done. We would like to emphasize that the basic idea of local computation for propagating probabilities is due to Judea Pearl. It is a very innovative idea; we do not believe that it can be found in the Bayesian literature prior to Pearl's work. We see our contribution as extending the usefulness of Pearl's idea by generalizing it from Bayesian probabilities to belief functions. In the next section, we give a brief introduction to belief functions. The notions of qualitative independence for partitions and a qualitative Markov tree are introduced in Section III. Finally, in Section IV, we describe a scheme for propagating belief functions in qualitative Markov trees."

This happens because the Lagrangian does not contains terms proportional to $\\partial$\\_t $\\phi$ (x,t) where $\\phi$ (x,t) is the scalar potential. Moreover our choice of canonical variables was challenged. Actually, our set of independent variables is exactly the same as in G.

We show how these sets can be easily approximated by minimizing the L1 norm of the polynomial over the semialgebraic set, subject to positivity constraints. Intuitively, this corresponds to the trace minimization heuristic commonly encounter in minimum volume ellipsoid problems. From a computational viewpoint, we design a hierarchy of linear matrix inequality problems to generate these approximations, and we provide theoretically rigorous convergence results, in the sense that the hierarchy of outer approximations converges in volume (or, equivalently, almost everywhere and almost uniformly) to the original set. Two main applications of the proposed approach are considered. The first one aims at reconstruction/approximation of sets from a finite number of samples. In the second one, we show how the concept of polynomial superlevel set can be used to generate samples uniformly distributed on a given semialgebraic set. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated by different numerical examples."

We prove that these semantics are equivalent, and then present an axiomatization for the logic. We investigate the computational complexity of model checking and satisfiability for DCL-PC, and show that both problems are PSPACE-complete (and hence no worse than the underlying logic CL-PC). Finally, we investigate the characterisation of control in DCL-PC. We distinguish between first-order control -- the ability of an agent or coalition to control some state of affairs through the assignment of values to the variables under the control of the agent or coalition -- and second-order control -- the ability of an agent to exert control over the control that other agents have by transferring variables to other agents.

Energy conservation is ensured through a two-tier approach wherein the first tier eliminates `uninteresting' health parameter readings at the site of a sensing node and prevents these from being transmitted across the WBAN to the LPU. A reading is categorised as uninteresting if it deviates very slightly from its immediately preceding reading and does not provide new insight on the patient's well being. In addition to this, readings that are faulty and emanate from possible sensor malfunctions are also eliminated. These eliminations are done at the site of the sensor using algorithms that are light enough to effectively function in the extremely resource-constrained environments of the sensor nodes. We notice, through experiments, that this eliminates and thus reduces around 90% of the readings that need to be transmitted to the LPU leading to significant energy savings. Furthermore, the proper functioning of these algorithms in such constrained environments is confirmed and validated over a hardware simulation set up. The second tier of assessment includes a proposed anomaly detection model at the LPU that is capable of identifying anomalies from streaming health parameter readings and indicates an adverse medical condition. In addition to being able to handle streaming data, the model works within the resource-constrained environments of an LPU and eliminates the need of transmitting the data to a back-end cloud, ensuring further energy savings. The anomaly detection capability of the model is validated using data available from the critical care units of hospitals and is shown to be superior to other anomaly detection techniques."

Others soon followed: innkeepers, writers, scientists, and more artists. The White Mountains became a major attraction for tourists from the New England states and beyond. The circulation of paintings and prints depicting the area enabled those who could not visit, because of lack of means, distance, or other circumstance, to appreciate its beauty.\nTransportation improved to the region; inns and later grand resort hotels, complete with artists in residence, were built. Benjamin Champney (1817\u20131907), one of the early artists, popularized the Conway Valley. Other artists preferred the Franconia area, and yet still others ventured to Gorham, Shelburne and the communities of the north. Although these artists all painted similar scenes within the White Mountains, each artist had an individual style that characterized his work. These landscape paintings in the Hudson River tradition, however, eventually fell out of favor with the public, and, by the turn of the century, the era for White Mountain art had ended."

After describing the finite difference scheme, we propose an iterative method for solving the systems of nonlinear equations that arise in the discrete setting; it combines a continuation method, Newton iterations and inner loops of a bigradient like solver. The numerical method is used for simulating two examples. We also make experiments on the behaviour of the iterative algorithm when the parameters of the model vary. The theory of mean field games, (MFGs for short), aims at studying deterministic or stochastic differential games (Nash equilibria) as the number of agents tends to infinity. It supposes that the rational agents are indistinguishable and individually have a negligible influence on the game, and that each individual strategy is influenced by some averages of quantities depending on the states (or the controls as in the present work) of the other agents. MFGs have been introduced in the pioneering works of J-M. Lasry and P-L. Lions [17, 18, 19]. Independently and at approximately the same time, the notion of mean field games arose in the engineering literature, see the works of M.Y. Huang, P.E. Caines and R.Malham{\\'e} [14, 15]. The present work deals with numerical approximations of mean field games in which the agents interact through both their states and controls; it follows a more theoretical work by the second author, [16], which is devoted to the mathematical analysis of the related systems of nonlocal partial differential equations. There is not much literature on MFGs in which the agents also interact through their controls, see [13, 12, 8, 10, 7, 16]. To stress the fact that the latter situation is considered, we will sometimes use the terminology mean field games of control and the acronym MFGC."

In the early 1520s, several Spanish expeditions crossed Chiapas by land, and Spanish ships scouted the Pacific coast. The first highland colonial town in Chiapas, San Crist\u00f3bal de los Llanos, was established by Pedro de Portocarrero in 1527. Within a year, Spanish dominion extended over the upper drainage basin of the Grijalva River, Comit\u00e1n, and the Ocosingo valley. Encomienda rights were established, although in the earlier stages of conquest these amounted to little more than slave-raiding rights.\nThe colonial province of Chiapa was established by Diego Mazariegos in 1528, with the reorganisation of existing encomiendas and colonial jurisdictions, and the renaming of San Crist\u00f3bal as Villa Real, and its relocation to Jovel. Excessive Spanish demands for tribute and labour caused a rebellion by the indigenous inhabitants, who attempted to starve out the Spanish. The conquistadores launched punitive raids, but the natives abandoned their towns and fled to inaccessible regions. Internal divisions among the Spanish led to a general instability in the province; eventually the Mazariegos faction gained concessions from the Spanish Crown that allowed for the elevation of Villa Real to the status of city, as Ciudad Real, and the establishment of new laws that promoted stability in the newly conquered region."

In addition to be derivative-free, the algorithm is function-value-free: it exploits the objective function only through comparisons. It belongs to the class of comparison-based step-size adaptive randomized search (CB-SARS). For the convergence analysis, we follow the methodology developed in a companion paper for investigating linear convergence of CB-SARS: by exploiting invariance properties of the algorithm, we turn the study of global linear convergence on scaling-invariant functions into the study of the stability of an underlying normalized Markov chain (MC). We hence prove global linear convergence by studying the stability (irreducibility, recurrence, positivity, geometric ergodicity) of the normalized MC associated to the $(1+1)$-ES. More precisely, we prove that starting from any initial solution and any step-size, linear convergence with probability one and in expectation occurs. Our proof holds on unimodal functions that are the composite of strictly increasing functions by positively homogeneous functions with degree $\\alpha$ (assumed also to be continuously differentiable). This function class includes composite of norm functions but also non-quasi convex functions. Because of the composition by a strictly increasing function, it includes non continuous functions. We find that a sufficient condition for global linear convergence is the step-size increase on linear functions, a condition typically satisfied for standard parameter choices. While introduced more than 40 years ago, we provide here the first proof of global linear convergence for the $(1+1)$-ES with generalized one-fifth success rule and the first proof of linear convergence for a CB-SARS on such a class of functions that includes non-quasi convex and non-continuous functions. Our proof also holds on functions where linear convergence of some CB-SARS was previously proven, namely convex-quadratic functions (including the well-know sphere function)."

Against this background, we will explore the role of computational power and information technologies as dominant factors in the formation of computational urban models and normative city theories. We will show how these models and theories, emerging mainly during the 19th and 20th centuries, present leaping correspondences with more ancient conceptions of the city, when observed from a meta-level or episteme (Foucault, 2002) approach. First, and for the sake of clarity, we will deal with some methodological elucidations around the concepts of theory, model and episteme, and how we will refer conceptually to these terms throughout this paper. Secondly, we will review these evolving technological and computational levels of abstraction and their influence on the different conceptions of the city. Thirdly, we will develop the hypothesis of a conceptual gap, between our current technological capacity -- grounded on the abundance and availability of urban data streams -- and the state of the art in urban modelling and city theory. Lastly, building upon Foucault's concept of episteme (Foucault, 1970) and genealogy (Foucault, 1977b), we will explore this gap by speculating around the possibility of an inversion in computational urban modelling and city theory. And above all, we will question the terms in which we can think of the city, in an age where the world can be virtually conceived as fully urban, and the continuity and abundance of urban data streams giving account of it can be taken for granted. How are we articulating the phenomena we call city on top of this generic common ground?"

We then identify a restricted framework in order to design and analyze physical models of complex fluid flows by means of computer algebra and thus obtain the entire ensemble of possible combination of conservative and non-conservative terms with the objective of obtaining specifically an entropy supplementary conservation law. The theory as well as developed computer algebra tool are then applied to a Baer-Nunziato two-phase flow model and to a multicomponent plasma fluid model. The first one is a first-order fluid model, with non-conservative terms impacting on the linearly degenerate field and requires a closure since there is no way to derive interfacial quantities from averaging principles and we need guidance in order to close the pressure and velocity of the interface and the thermodynamics of the mixture. The second one involves first order terms for the heavy species coupled to second order terms for the electrons, the non-conservative terms impact the genuinely nonlinear fields and the model can be rigorously derived from kinetic theory. We show how the theory allows to recover the whole spectrum of closures obtained so far in the literature for the two-phase flow system as well as conditions when one aims at extending the thermodynamics and also applies to the plasma case, where we recover the usual entropy supplementary equation, thus assessing the effectiveness and scope of the proposed theory."

Flattening the density profile of galactic hot haloes weakens the surface brightness constraint so that a typical L$_*$ galaxy may hold half its missing baryons in its halo, but the OVII constraint remains unchanged, and around the Milky Way a flattened profile may only hold $6-13%$ of the missing baryons from the Galaxy ($2-4 \\times 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$). We also show that AGN and supernovae at low to moderate redshift - the theoretical sources of winds responsible for driving out the missing baryons - do not produce the expected correlations with the baryonic Tully-Fisher relationship and so are insufficient to explain the missing baryons from galaxies. We conclude that most of missing baryons from galaxies do not lie in hot haloes around the galaxies, and that the missing baryons never fell into the potential wells of protogalaxies in the first place.

When the perturbation space satisfies some additional condition (we then call it matching), we manage to narrow the gap between stability hypotheses (e.g. the BR M condition) and instability hypotheses, thus circumbscribing the stability threshold. The formulas relating the growth M of derivatives of the perturbation on the one hand, and the arithmetics of robust frequencies or the stability time on the other hand, bring light to the competition between stability properties of nearly integrable systems and the distance to integrability. Due to our method of proof using width of regularity as a regularizing parameter, these formulas are closer to optimal as the the regularity tends to analyticity."

This will allow accessing the involved intermediate states and obtaining a clearer image of the dynamic of the multiple ionization process. MOSARIX can also be used for the investigation of very low cross-section phenomena such as attosecond electron dynamics 2 and High-Energy Resolution Off-Resonant Spectroscopy (HEROS) 3,4.

None of the studs in that picture have horizontal cross bracing right where the two sheets of drywall meet, which is what I've been trying to say all along.  As such, there are no nails there (as there is nothing into which to drive them).  Judging by OP's picture, his roof joists probably run in a similar direction to how mine run, and thus there is too large a span without screws to hold the joint together.  If I were the guy that had done OP's ceiling, I'd have added some sort of brace across that seam.\n\nThe same has probably happened to OP's ceiling, which is all I've said, but instead of going with it, you've attempted (poorly) to instead try to claim what I said was wrong, when it clearly isn't.\n\nAs to nails -- I personally never use nails in drywall.

We have used the IRAM/JCMT unbiased spectral survey of IRAS 16293-2422 which allows us to search for the DCOOCH3 rotational transitions within the survey spectral range (80-280 GHz, 328-366 GHz). The expected emission of deuterated methyl formate is modelled at LTE and compared with the observations.} We have tentatively detected DCOOCH3 in the protostar IRAS 16293-2422. We assign eight lines detected in the IRAM survey to DCOOCH3. Three of these lines are affected by blending problems and one line is affected by calibration uncertainties, nevertheless the LTE emission model is compatible with the observations. A simple LTE modelling of the two cores in IRAS 16293-2422, based on a previous interferometric study of HCOOCH3, allows us to estimate the amount of DCOOCH3 in IRAS 16293-2422. Adopting an excitation temperature of 100 K and a source size of 2\\arcsec and 1\\farcs5 for the A and B cores, respectively, we find that N(A,DCOOCH3) = N(B,DCOOCH3) ~ 6.10^14 /cm2. The derived deuterium fractionation is ~ 15%, consistent with values for other deuterated species in this source and much greater than that expected from the deuterium cosmic abundance. DCOOCH3, if its tentative detection is confirmed, should now be considered in theoretical models that study complex molecule formation and their deuteration mechanisms. Experimental work is also needed to investigate the different chemical routes leading to the formation of deuterated methyl formate."

Considering an ideal population consisting of a single homogeneous animal species, that is, neglecting the variations in age, size and any periodicity for birth or mortality, and which lives alone in an invariable environment or coexists with other species without any direct or indirect inuence, he founded in 1798, with his celebrated claim Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio, the paradigm of exponential growth. This consists in assuming that the increase of the number N (t) of individuals of this population, during a short interval of time, is proportional to N (t). This translates to the following dierential equation : (1) dN (t) dt = $\\epsilon$N (t) where $\\epsilon$ is a constant factor of proportionality that represents the growth coe-cient or growth rate. By integrating (1) we obtain the law of exponential growth or law of Malthusian growth (see Fig. 1). This law, which does not take into account the limits imposed by the environment on growth and which is in disagreement with the actual facts, had a profound inuence on Charles Darwin's work on natural selection. Indeed, Darwin [1] founded the idea of survival of the ttest on the 1.

That's just moronic.\nHanede: Australian government actually has made campaigns to eradicate cats, but they reproduce really fast so it's not a very viable solution, especially when irresponsible owners let their cats roam free (even worse if they aren't neutered/spayed).\n\nNot to mention the general population goes crazy when governments want to kill \"cute\" animals (even if it's to protect endangered ecosystems), even worse if they are popular pets, so it's hard to actually execute those campaigns.\n\nSo are you saying that making fenced outdoor areas for cats is more cruel than killing them? Seriously?\nno112358: Would you live your whole life in or would you want life free? I'd rather be dead myself.\nHanede: Animals don't have a concept of \"freedom\" like humans do, so that analogy is pointless. If the cat has enough stimulation (cat trees, toys, owners who spend time playing with it etc.) it can live a perfectly happy life indoors. You can also use a harness to walk your cat like a dog, if you want it to experience the outdoors safely.\n\nIt's not only safer for wildlife, but also for the cat itself (no worrying about other cats attacking/infecting it, dogs or wild predators killing it, awful people stealing or hurting it, cars running over it, etc.).\nno112358: So you're saying animals behave the same if locked up or free? You presume that cats are happy if owners and indoor environment has enough stimulation.\n\nDo you feel the same about all animals, or is it just pets humans keep? It's very hypocritical if you say just pets.\n\nLife is life, things happen. My cat would be much happier outside, but I live in a apartment building and I can't just let him out. But when I did go out with him he was going crazy with happiness. Sniffed everything, rolled on grass etc.\n\nGovernments have no right to keep animals inside with laws. They can invest in programs that spay cats, to lower the reproduction, if the problem is really high.\n\nIn my country there's no law prohibiting stuff like this and there's plenty of birds everywhere.\nHanede: I believe almost any animal can be kept in captivity if you give it appropiate space and enrichment. One exception would be cetaceans since they need so much water area which is hard to give them and they get bored and stressed because they are so intelligent.\n\nSpay programs are hardly effective, since infertile animals will still kill plenty of wildlife, you invest a ton of time and resources and they don't really lower the population unless you sterilize virtually all animals. Even a few leftover can easily repopulate. \n\nOf course they don't kill 100% of birds, but there are plenty of studies about cat impact on wildlife (not on lit birds, also rodents, lizards, marsupials etc.). Maybe you would see more uncommon species if it weren't for cats.\n"

In this paper, we introduce three multilevel variance reduction strategies that rely on surrogate-based CV and MLMC. MLCV is presented as an extension of CV where the correction terms devised from surrogate models for simulators of different levels add up. MLMC-CV improves the MLMC estimator by using a CV based on a surrogate of the correction term at each level. Further variance reduction is achieved by using the surrogate-based CVs of all the levels in the MLMC-MLCV strategy. Alternative solutions that reduce the subset of surrogates used for the multilevel estimation are also introduced. The proposed methods are tested on a test case from the literature consisting of a spectral discretization of an uncertain 1D heat equation, where the statistic of interest is the expected value of the integrated temperature along the domain at a given time. The results are assessed in terms of the accuracy and computational cost of the multilevel estimators, depending on whether the construction of the surrogates, and the associated computational cost, precede the evaluation of the estimator. It was shown that when the lower fidelity outputs are strongly correlated with the high-fidelity outputs, a significant variance reduction is obtained when using surrogate models for the coarser levels only. It was also shown that taking advantage of pre-existing surrogate models proves to be an even more efficient strategy."

When I switched on the dishwasher with the paper clip in line (in place of the flood switch) there was a tiny bit of smoke coming up from the paper clip for a brief moment.\n\nAll I can suspect right now is that the water valve is seized or something and potentially drew too much amperage, But then I would have expected a fuse to blow, but the drain pump works, the main pump works, the detergent dispenser flip door opens, all of the other electronic functions still work fine.\n\nMy first instinct would be to check the fuse that protects the flood switch water valve circuit but the wiring diagram does not show any such fuse exists In fact the wiring diagram does not show any fuses for the whole dishwasher, a Google search revealed that most dishwasher don't have fuses but rather might have a fusible link at the control board, but only one, and if that was the case then I wouldn't have power going to anything else especially the high amperage consumers like the motors/pumps...\n\nI'm not really sure what to check next, thanks for any help you can provide.\nlocus2779: Go to repairclinic.com and look up your dishwasher. Jumping a switch with a paperclip is dangerous for many reasons, but the expensive one has to do with logic. The control board may be expecting to see a specific voltage drop across that circuit, or have it pulled high or low. Simply jumping it runs the risk of shorting something out in the control board.\n\nAlso, you very likely want to see DC, probably 5, 12, or 24v, not AC. AC and control systems don't play nicely.\nSunstar823: Thanks,\n\n1) I went to repair clinic, it doesn't provide much information other than trying to sell parts which will be fine when I'm ready to buy parts.\n\n2) The system runs on 120 volt AC, I'm looking at the wiring diagram right now and it measured at all the main pumps and functioning units.\nbig_like_a_pickle: Unless your dishwasher is 30+ years old, it has a microcontroller inside it and additional digital circuitry. Digital all runs on DC. \n\nAgain, unless it's old. I'm guessing the only components that directly use AC are the pump and heating element. The valves are likely DC solenoids. \n\n\n&gt; there was a tiny bit of smoke coming up from the paper clip for a brief moment\n\nNot sure what the mystery is here?

For both the broadcasting problem and the source detection problem, we obtain solutions with a convergence time of $O(\\log^2 n)$ rounds, w.h.p., from any starting configuration. The solution to broadcasting is exact, which means that all agents reach the state broadcast by the source, while the solution to source detection admits one-sided error on a $\\varepsilon$-fraction of the population (which is unavoidable for this problem). Both protocols are easy to implement in practice and have a compact formulation.Our protocols exploit the properties of self-organizing oscillatory dynamics. On the hardness side, our main structural insight is to prove that any protocol which meets the constraints of universality and of rapid convergence after reconfiguration must display a form of non-stationary behavior (of which oscillatory dynamics are an example). We also observe that the periodicity of the oscillatory behavior of the protocol, when present, must necessarily depend on the number $^\\\\# X$ of source agents present in the population. For instance, our protocols inherently rely on the emergence of a signal passing through the population, whose period is $\\Theta(\\log \\frac{n}{^\\\\# X})$ rounds for most starting configurations.

It has a stellar classification of B2 IV, which matches a massive B-type subgiant star. The primary has 8.5 times the mass of the Sun and 6.4 times the Sun's radius. It is a Beta Cephei type variable star with a brightness that periodically varies from magnitude +3.38 to +3.41 over an interval of 0.17 days.

This answers an open problem posed by Awerbuch and Varghese (FOCS 1991). We also show that $\\Omega(\\log n)$ time is necessary, even in synchronous networks. Another property is that if $f$ faults occurred, then, within the requireddetection time above, they are detected by some node in the $O(f\\log n)$ locality of each of the faults.Second, we show how to enhance a known transformer that makes input/output algorithms self-stabilizing. It now takes as input an efficient construction algorithm and an efficient self-stabilizing proof labeling scheme, and produces an efficient self-stabilizing algorithm. When used for MST, the transformer produces a memory optimal self-stabilizing algorithm, whose time complexity, namely, $O(n)$, is significantly better even than that of previous algorithms. (The time complexity of previous MST algorithms that used $\\Omega(\\log^2 n)$ memory bits per node was $O(n^2)$, and the time for optimal space algorithms was $O(n|E|)$.) Inherited from our proof labelling scheme, our self-stabilising MST construction algorithm also has the following two properties: (1) if faults occur after the construction ended, then they are detected by some nodes within $O(\\log ^2 n)$ time in synchronous networks, or within $O(\\Delta \\log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, and (2) if $f$ faults occurred, then, within the required detection time above, they are detected within the $O(f\\log n)$ locality of each of the faults.

The piston, which can have different origins (instrumental stability, atmospheric perturbations, ...), thus amplifies the effect of parasitic interference. According to specifications of piston correction in space or at ground level (respectively $\\lambda/500\\approx 2$nm and $\\lambda/30\\approx 100$nm), the detection of hot Jupiter-like planets, one of the most challenging aims for current ground-based interferometers, limits parasitic radiation to about 5\\% of the incident intensity.

Otherwise, if no fringe tracking is used, the detection of a typical hot Jupiter-like system with a solar-like star would admit a maximum level of parasitic intensity of 0.01\\% for piston errors equal to $\\lambda$/15. If the fringe tracking specifications are not precisely observed, it thus appears that the allowed level of parasitic intensity dramatically decreases and may prevent the detection. In parallel, the calibration of the parasitic phase by a reference star, at this accuracy level, seems very difficult. Moreover, since parasitic phase is an object-dependent quantity, the use of a hypothetical phase abacus, directly giving the parasitic phase from a given parasitic flux level, is also impossible. Some instrumental solutions, implemented at the instrument design stage for limiting or preventing this parasitic interference, appears to be crucial and are presented in this paper."

More precisely, we give an example of a second-order linear Kolmogorov PDE with globally bounded and smooth coefficients and a smooth initial function with compact support such that the unique globally bounded viscosity solution of the PDE is not even locally H\\\"{o}lder continuous. From the perspective of probability theory, the existence of this example PDE has the consequence that there exists a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with globally bounded and smooth coefficients and a smooth function with compact support which is mapped by the corresponding transition semigroup to a function which is not locally H\\\"{o}lder continuous. In other words, degenerate noise can have a roughening effect. A further implication of this loss of regularity phenomenon is that numerical approximations may converge without any arbitrarily small polynomial rate of convergence to the true solution of the SDE. More precisely, we prove for an example SDE with globally bounded and smooth coefficients that the standard Euler approximations converge to the exact solution of the SDE in the strong and numerically weak sense, but at a rate that is slower then any power law."

Applying this technique to clique-width, another important graph parameter, remained to be done. In this paper we study several graph theoretic problems for which hardness results exist such as cycle problems (triangle detection, triangle counting, girth, diameter), distance problems (diameter, eccentricities, Gromov hyperbolicity, betweenness centrality) and maximum matching. We provide hardness results and fully polynomial FPT algorithms, using clique-width and some of its upper-bounds as parameters (split-width, modular-width and $P\\_4$-sparseness). We believe that our most important result is an ${\\cal O}(k^4 \\cdot n + m)$-time algorithm for computing a maximum matching where $k$ is either the modular-width or the $P\\_4$-sparseness. The latter generalizes many algorithms that have been introduced so far for specific subclasses such as cographs, $P\\_4$-lite graphs, $P\\_4$-extendible graphs and $P\\_4$-tidy graphs. Our algorithms are based on preprocessing methods using modular decomposition, split decomposition and primeval decomposition.

We show that while it may be impossible to directly detect a multi-agent activity due to sensor noise or malfunction, the occurrence of the activity can still be inferred by considering both its impact on the future behaviors of the people involved as well as the events that could have preceded it. Further, we show that given a model of successfully performed multi-agent activities, along with a set of examples of failed attempts at the same activities, our system automatically learns an augmented model that is capable of recognizing success and failure, as well as goals of peoples actions with high accuracy. We compare our approach with other alternatives and show that our unified model, which takes into account not only relationships among individual players, but also relationships among activities over the entire length of a game, although more computationally costly, is significantly more accurate.

Deterministic variants are weaker, the class named 2detLIN, a proper subclass of linear languages is accepted by them. Recently, another specific variants, the state-deterministic sensing 5'->3' WK automata are investigated in which the graph of the automaton has the special property that for each node of the graph, all out edges (if any) go to a sole node, i.e., for each state there is (at most) one state that can be reached by a direct transition. It was shown that this concept is somewhat orthogonal to the usual concept of determinism in case of sensing 5'->3' WK automata. In this paper a new concept, the quasi-determinism is investigated, that is in each configuration of a computation (if it is not finished yet), the next state is uniquely determined although the next configuration may not be, in case various transitions are enabled at the same time. We show that this new concept is a common generalisation of the usual determinism and the state-determinism, i.e., the class of quasi-deterministic sensing 5'->3' WK automata is a superclass of both of the mentioned other classes. There are various usual restrictions on WK automata, e.g., stateless or 1-limited variants. We also prove some hierarchy results among language classes accepted by various subclasses of quasi-deterministic sensing 5'->3' WK automata and also some other already known language classes."

In this note we review a simple way of evaluating the steady material functions characterizing the nonlinear evolution of the polymeric contributions to the shear stress and first normal stress difference as the shear rate increases, provide asymptotic expansions as a function of $\\textrm{Wi}$ , and show that it is in fact possible to construct universal master curves for these two material functions as well as the corresponding stress ratio. Steady shear flow experiments on three highly elastic dilute polymer solutions of different finite extensibilities also follow the identified master curves. The governing dimensionless parameter for these master curves is $\\textrm{Wi}/L$ and it is only in strong shear flows exceeding $\\textrm{Wi}/L \\gtrsim 1$ that the effects of finite extensibility of the polymer chains dominate the evolution of polymeric stresses in the flow field.

        "text": " notebooks are an example of such tools. Then, our main question is: What is an efficient and effective method of designing and implementing notebook interfaces for DSLs? By addressing this question we might be able to speed up the development of DSL tools, and ease the interaction between end-users and DSLs. Approach: In this paper, we present Bacat\\'a, a mechanism for generating notebook interfaces for DSLs in a language parametric fashion. We designed this mechanism in a way in which language engineers can reuse as many language components (e.g., language processors, type checkers, code generators) as possible. Knowledge: Our results show that notebook interfaces generated by Bacat\\'a can be automatically generated with little manual configuration. There are few considerations and caveats that should be addressed by language engineers that rely on language design aspects. The creation of a notebook for a DSL with Bacat\\'a becomes a matter of writing the code that wires existing language components in the Rascal language workbench with the Jupyter platform. Grounding: We evaluate Bacat\\'a by generating functional computational notebook interfaces for three different non-trivial DSLs, namely: a small subset of Halide (a DSL for digital image processing), SweeterJS (an extended version of JavaScript), and QL (a DSL for questionnaires). Additionally, it is relevant to generate notebook implementations rather than implementing them manually. We measured and compared the number of Source Lines of Code (SLOCs) that we reused from existing implementations of those languages. Importance: The adoption of notebooks by novice-programmers and end-users has made them very popular in several domains such as exploratory programming, data science, data journalism, and machine learning. Why are they popular? In (data) science, it is essential to make results reproducible as well as understandable. However, notebooks are only available for GPLs. This paper opens up the notebook metaphor for DSLs to improve the end-user experience when interacting with code and to increase DSLs adoption."

After that even passive hangs seemed to much for me, I felt my left hand was supporting most of my weight. I felt so weak and so powerless because of my injury. And also a lot of guilt because I haven't been serious about my grip training. I guess I was in denial about the consequences of my injury on my fitness level, how serious my injury was and how permanently damaged my hand is. \n\nI now feel overwhelmed by the progress I'll have to do again to come back to normal - if that's even possible.\n\nSo I'm coming here whoring some support and encouragements. And also advices : for the some of you who went through injuries, how did you manage being brought so far backward in your fitness level ?

I'm wondering how that would limit / affect me in the longterm.\n\nThanks everyone in advance for your answers and support and thanks in general for being an awesome source of fitness inspiration and motivation !\nmunkie15: It will take time to build up the grip in your injured hand. It sounds like there was a lot of trauma to that area. Tendons and things take a long time to fully heal. Just keep working the grip in your injured hand. Think about adjusting how you grip as well. Maybe a hook type grip will work better than the bar type grip?\n\nAlso, the pinky provides relatively little in grip strength, more for stability.\ndariargos: yup, there was a lot of trauma. My middle finger was injured too but I was lucky the damage was superficial.\n\nOne aspect that difficult for me was that I didn't felt that my fourth finger tendon was that damaged : for the pinky it was obvious, I couldn't move it anymore but I could still move my fourth finger fine. So when the surgeon told me they had to open up the finger to stitch back the tendon I didn't understand. Now that the wound has healed up, I guess that one part of me thought that the tendon was okay too...\n\nThe hook grip seems very interesting ! I'll give it a go when I have a bar to train on again.

A little trick to work on eye contact is: while you are walking in the street, try making eye contact with a stranger and smiling. Wait until you get uncomfortable and then wait just a second more. Over time you will get more and more comfortable with eye contact. Keep practicing your presentation until you think you have it down that way you will feel more relaxed during the actual delivery. Since she knows you don't have much public speaking experience she should be pretty forgiving so don't take it too hard. Hope I helped :)\nTrhtry4676: I didn't think you were meant to look at strangers, is this not the case?

I do not ever feel relaxed speaking, even speaking just to myself is forced.

But now that I connect them to the drain pipe it alarms.  There's no obvious water blockage.\n\nCould it have something to do with the pressure of being looped into a longer, narrower PVC drain pipe (third picture)?

The pressure is stopping water flow so It\u2019s like you\u2019ve got a clog until the sump dumps. Try replacing your first pvc 90 with a pvc 90 T and run a pipe up from there to create a vent. That might fix it without having to get to the sump. \nmbacarella: https://imgur.com/XQx5v89\n\nDid something similar.\n\nAdded a T immediately downstream from the vinyl T, pointing up, to vent the pressure (didn't want to mess with cutting out and replacing that 90)\n\nSo far so good!

Computing the union of the classical and asymptotic critical values allows one to put into practice generalisations of Ehresmann's fibration theorem. This leads to natural and efficient applications in polynomial optimisation and computational real algebraic geometry. Going back to previous works by Kurdyka, Orro and Simon, we design new algorithms to compute asymptotic critical values. Through randomisation, we introduce new geometric characterisations of asymptotic critical values. This allows us to dramatically reduce the complexity of computing such values to a cost that is essentially $O(d^{2n(p+1)})$ arithmetic operations in $\\mathbb{Q}$. We also obtain tighter degree bounds on a hypersurface containing the asymptotic critical values, showing that the degree is at most $p^{n-p+1}(d-1)^{n-p}(d+1)^{p}$. Next, we show how to apply these algorithms to unconstrained polynomial optimisation problems and the problem of computing sample points per connected component of a semi-algebraic set defined by a single inequality/inequation. We report on the practical capabilities of our implementation of this algorithm. It shows how the practical efficiency surpasses the current state-of-the-art algorithms for computing asymptotic critical values by tackling examples that were previously out of reach."

If anyone has had a similar problem and found doing something helped alleviate it, please let me know what you did.\neshlow: Foam roller is good, but you really need to hang out in the same position for about a minute or two (sometimes more) and do some deep breathing to allow the joints/muscles to relax and gain the extension.\n\nCat-camels done correctly should help. Bridges are good too.\n\nI'm pretty partial to using a doorway or band (such as the band stretchin OG) to force your scapulas to retract and loosen. You can work this with some thoracic flexion/extension to really mobilize the muscles in the back.\n\nWall slides are ok, but usually are not good by themselves. \n\nSome \"maxalding\" scapular control techniques would probably be good as well.\n\n\nIf your posture is crap from decades at a desk job, it's going to take a while (see: months) to get things back so be patient.\nyagsuomynona: What's this?\n\n&gt;Some \"maxalding\" scapular control techniques would probably be good as well.\n\nAnd do you mean the overhead doorway stretch or something else? and how would you do that with bands?\n\n&gt;I'm pretty partial to using a doorway or band (such as the band stretchin OG) to force your scapulas to retract and loosen. You can work this with some thoracic flexion/extension to really mobilize the muscles in the back.\neshlow: * \"maxalding\" basically voluntary muscle control of various muscles:\n\nhttp://www.maxalding.co.uk/exercises/exercises.htm\n\n* Doorway stretch is for pecs; I use the doorway and band to force the scapula to retract and/or depress by leaning into the door (do not actively contract it) and force it further than it typically goes. You should feel some stretching and other weird sensations as it moves to places where it hasn't been in forever. Increasing this passive range of motion allows you to increase your active ability to move it around a bit more.\nyagsuomynona: I still don't get exactly what this doorway stretch is. \n\nIs this guess correct? Are you putting your hands on the sides of the doorway and leaning in, kind of like the pec stretch but to the sides instead of overhead?\n\nAnd what exactly are you doing with the bands?\neshlow: No... the doorway stretch is different than the scapular mobilizations you can use with a doorway or bands. The scapular mobilizations are not really a stretch but a mobility exercise.\n\nIf you have OG look in the mobility section, otherwise don't worry about it too much.\nimtightaight: OG as in overcoming gravity? I just looked that up on Amazon and book costs $50! That has to be one of cheapest textbooks! Plus it has almost all positive reviews. Thanks for info man\neshlow: You're welcome.\n\nAnd if you were wondering I did write OG.\n161803398874989: It kinda says that in your flair.\neshlow: Yep, some people don't read flair though for whatever reason (on their phones or whatnot). \n\nAlso, if you answer from the dashboard messages it doesn't show the flair either.\n"

Also it's very important to have a confident vibe. I always have a slight smile (genuine), with open, approachable body language. I give good eye contact to whoever's speaking. I try to engage others around me, using their name at least once. I will touch people (lightly) in a neutral spot like the arm while I'm making a point. (not repeatedly. A little goes along way when it comes to touching! But it seems to affect people positively)  I bring an enthusiastic vibe to my interactions.\nPickledSpaceHog: Yes absolutely! Confidence and body language can go such a long way. \n\nI just know that in helping a few of my friends, they weren't sure on how to exude confidence or get nervous and don't have super great body language.\n\nAnd I am so uncomfortable with physical touch even though I know people probably enjoy it. I just don't want to encourage them to touch me at all. Lol \n\nSo, I wanted to have some steps people can actively take during conversations that didn't really include *feeling* a type of way. \n\nBut you're totally right it is important!

Autistic children can have a complete breakdown from certain sensory input, a common one is irritating buzzing noises and the feeling of clippers over the head. Autism is a spectrum of symptoms, I can't say one specific reaction or symptom every child with autism will have. Look up some information yourself, man.\nShellphon3: If you want to posit that children will be hurt by clippers cite an instance of something like that happening, I dont know how you think the burden lies on me to fact check you.\nChaotross: Because you claimed you could cut anyone's hair out of nowhere with zero issue without any training even as a barber. I am countering your claim, the burden of proof is on you. You're being willfully ignorant.\n\nhowever, [here](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-39502366) is a similar article where a child had to be physically restrained while screaming before he found a barber that works with autistic and terminally ill children. If he wasn't physically restrained he would've injured himself.\nShellphon3: Clippers wont cut a kid,  and outside of kids who fall out of chairs I don't see how the distress of a haircut will cause physical harm. Tue article you linked makes the point that the kids are disruptive to business in barber shops, which is much more compelling than the notion that clippers will harm kids.\nChaotross: When did I *ever* say the clippers would cut them? The answer is never. The kid would hurt himself trying to fight out of being restrained. Kids falling out of chairs is *exactly* the issue, along with possibly causing injury to themselves if they hit themselves with their reaction.

The first study advances LoD-2 building modeling from satellite-derived Orthophoto and DSMs with a novel approach employing a model-driven workflow that generates building rectangular 3D geometry models. Secondly, we further enhanced our building reconstruction framework for dense urban areas and non-rectangular purposes, we implemented deep learning for unit-level segmentation and introduced a gradient-based circle reconstruction for circular buildings to develop a polygon composition technique for advanced building LoD2 reconstruction. Our third study utilizes high-spatiotemporal resolution PlanetScope satellite imagery for glacier tracking at 3D level in mid-latitude regions. Finally, we proposed a term as \"Algal Behavior Function\" to refine the quantification of chlorophyll-a concentrations from satellite imagery in water quality monitoring, addressing algae fluctuations and timing discrepancies between satellite observations and field measurements, thus enhancing the precision of underwater algae volume estimates. Overall, this dissertation demonstrates the extensive potential of satellite photogrammetry applications in addressing urban and environmental challenges. It further showcases innovative analytical methodologies that enhance the applicability of adapting stereo and multi-view very high-resolution satellite-derived 3D data.

Anal. 38 (2006b) 574-594 (electronic)], the so-called needlets. The expansions are truncated at scale indices no larger than some ${J^{\\star}}$, and the $L^p$ distances between those estimates and the null density are computed. One family of tests (called Multiple) is based on the idea of testing the distance from the null for each choice of $J=1,\\ldots,{J^{\\star}}$, whereas the so-called PlugIn approach is based on the single full ${J^{\\star}}$ expansion, but with thresholded wavelet coefficients. We describe the practical implementation of these two procedures and compare them to other methods in the literature. As alternatives to isotropy, we consider both very simple toy models and more realistic nonisotropic models based on Physics-inspired simulations. The Monte Carlo study shows good performance of the Multiple test, even at moderate sample size, for a wide sample of alternative hypotheses and for different choices of the parameter ${J^{\\star}}$. On the 69 most energetic events published by the Pierre Auger Collaboration, the needlet-based procedures suggest statistical evidence for anisotropy. Using several values for the parameters of the methods, our procedures yield $p$-values below 1%, but with uncontrolled multiplicity issues. The flexibility of this method and the possibility to modify it to take into account a large variety of extensions of the problem make it an interesting option for future investigation of the origin of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays."

I countersunk the lag bolts so at a later date I can cover the 2x4s, wires, and outlet up with some kind of panel.

And what kind of hardware did you use to attach the mount to the 2x4s?\nn17ikh: I believe I used 4\" lag bolts to mount the 2x4s to the wall, and counter sunk some carriage bolts on the wall side of the 2x4s so I could attach the mount with the nuts on the mount's side, where they could be covered by the plastic decorative cover that came with the mount. I don't remember what diameter carriage bolts I used, whatever the biggest I could buy that would fit through the holes in the mount.

You don't need any extra countersinking for the square part, it's what grabs the wood and stops the bolt from turning when you put the nut on the front side. A different approach could be T-nuts on the backside of the wood with regular bolts from the front, instead of carriage bolts. That might actually be better since they're made to grip better in wood.\nDoyouwantaspoon: I have very little knowledge of carpentry hardware, so I'd never even heard of t-nuts, but they look perfect!

While modeling aspects can be suitably addressed by these approaches, analytical tools working on parametric characterizations are often more difficult to be defined and the standard approach is to 'unfold' the parametric model, in order to exploit standard analysis algorithms working at the unfolded 'ground' level. Moreover, parameterized combinatorial methods still require the statistical independence assumption. In the present paper we consider the formalism of Parametric Fault Tree (PFT) and we show how it can be related to Probabilistic Horn Abduction (PHA). Since PHA is a framework where both modeling and analysis can be performed in a restricted first-order language, we aim at showing that converting a PFT into a PHA knowledge base will allow an approach to dependability analysis directly exploiting parametric representation. We will show that classical qualitative and quantitative dependability measures can be characterized within PHA. Furthermore, additional modeling aspects (such as noisy gates and local dependencies) as well as additional reliability measures (such as posterior probability analysis) can be naturally addressed by this conversion. A simple example of a multi-processor system with several replicated units is used to illustrate the approach."

In this paper, we show that in the case of ``weakly'' unstable schemes with multiple roots on the unit circle, although the schemes may remain stable, the consideration of parasitic modes is essential in studying their consistency and, consequently, their convergence. Otherwise said, the lack of genuine stability prevents bounding the global truncation error using the local truncation error, and one is thus compelled to study the former on its own. This research was prompted by unexpected numerical results on lattice Boltzmann schemes, which can be rewritten in terms of multi-step Finite Difference schemes. Initial expectations suggested that third-order initialization schemes would suffice to maintain the accuracy of a fourth-order multi-step scheme. However, this assumption proved incorrect for ``weakly'' unstable schemes. This borderline scenario underscores the significance of genuine stability in facilitating the construction of Lax-Richtmyer-like theorems and in mastering the impact of round-off errors. Despite the simplicity and apparent lack of practical usage of the linear transport equation at constant velocity considered throughout the paper, we demonstrate that high-order lattice Boltzmann schemes for this equation can be used to tackle non-linear systems of conservation laws relying on a Jin-Xin approximation and high-order splitting formulae."

Conversely, modeling cooperation at a site, we also consider cases where each one gets more than f(x). There are k identical players that compete over the rewards. They independently act in parallel, in a one-shot scenario, each specifying a single site to visit, without knowing which sites are explored by others. The group performance is evaluated by the expected coverage, defined as the sum of f(x) over all sites that are explored by at least one player. Since we assume that players cannot coordinate before choosing their site we focus on symmetric strategies. The main takeaway message of this paper is that the optimal symmetric coverage is expected to emerge when collision costs are relatively high, so that the following \"Judgment of Solomon\" type of rule holds: If a single player explores a site x then it gains its full reward f(x), but if several players explore it, then neither one receives any reward. Under this policy, it turns out that there exists a unique symmetric Nash Equilibrium strategy, which is, in fact, evolutionary stable. Moreover, this strategy yields the best possible coverage among all symmetric strategies. Viewing the coverage measure as the social welfare, this policy thus enjoys a (Symmetric) Price of Anarchy of precisely 1, whereas, in fact, any other congestion policy has a price strictly greater than 1. Our model falls within the scope of mechanism design, and more precisely in the area of incentivizing exploration. It finds relevance in evolutionary ecology, and further connects to studies on Bayesian parallel search algorithms."

This weak dissipativity allows high order energy estimates without derivative loss; the analysis is carried out for a class of linear non-characteristic hyperbolic systems, as well as for a class of characteristic systems that satisfy an algebraic structural property that allows us to define a generalized vorticity. We then show, using a change of {unknowns}, that {it} is possible to transform the linearized wave-interaction {problem} into a non-characteristic system, {which} satisfies this structural property and for which the boundary conditions are weakly dissipative. We can therefore use our general analysis to derive linear, and then nonlinear, a priori energy estimates. Existence for the linearized problem is obtained by a regularization procedure that makes the problem non-characteristic and strictly dissipative, and by the approximation of the data by more regular data satisfying higher order compatibility conditions for the regularized problem. Due to the fully nonlinear nature of the boundary conditions, it is also necessary to implement a quasilinearization procedure. Finally, we have to lower the standard requirements on the regularity of the coefficients of the operator in the linear estimates to be able to reach the quasilinear regularity threshold in the nonlinear well-posedness result."

Finally, we adapted the concept of a datasheet to facilitate comparisons of different implementations. Knowledge: Our benchmark creates a common ground to frame work in this area. Language designers who claim to support typed programming over tables have a clear suite against which to demonstrate their system's expressive power. Our family of errors also gives them a chance to demonstrate the quality of feedback. Researchers who improve one aspect -- especially error reporting -- without changing the other can demonstrate their improvement, as can those who engage in trade-offs between the two. The net result should be much better science in both expressiveness and diagnostics. We also introduce a datasheet format for presenting this knowledge in a methodical way. Grounding: We have generated our benchmark from real languages, libraries, and programs, as well as personal experience conducting and teaching data science. We have drawn on experience in engineering and, more recently, in data science to generate the datasheet. Importance: Claims about type support for tabular programming are hard to evaluate. However, tabular programming is ubiquitous, and the expressive power of type systems keeps growing. Our benchmark and datasheet can help lead to more orderly science.

Instead we develop a new and self-contained approach which enables us to emphasize the role played by the gravitation in the gauged $O(3)$ sigma model.

Now, they are saying it's okay when they neglect those morals if it's for something to support.\n\nThat only reinforces the viewpoint that their anti-LGBT donations are pure bigotry rather than pure religion.\nDraknusX: The corporate policy dates back to the first restaurant, before it was a chain. Back then, it was a 24 hour diner, and the owner wanted to ensure that their employees had a day off to relax and worship. The choice of the day was due to their faith, yes, but not due to some misunderstanding of Biblical law. I mean, the Sabbath is on Saturday anyway. They never believed it was a sin to work on Sunday. \n\nAlso, they haven't made a sizable donation to the anti-LGBT non profits that they've donated to before in 6 years. On top of that, only one of those non-profit organizations was actively against matter equality, the rest were just Christian organizations who's leadership, when pressed, didn't support marriage equality, which is hardly surprising, but also didn't really affect how those organizations ran. They've worked to remove anything of the sort from their corporate culture, they started doing so back in 2012 when the hit pieces on the peaked. But rather than count that as a win, because the big bad fast food chain actually learned something and tried to change, everyone still hangs onto the past because it's a lot easier to push the idea that people can't change than it is to admit they attacking people for their ingnorance rather then educating them is just vindictive.\n\nIn 2012 they had a major overhaul that was glossed over by the press. They released multiple statements promising to no longer financially support anti-lgbt organizations, and from all evidence so far they haven't broken that. They've decided to leave the politics to the politicians, at least in these matters. \n\nA quote from one of those statements: \"As we have stated, the Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect \u2014 regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender. We will continue this tradition in the over 1,600 restaurants run by independent Owner/Operators.\" \n\nI don't get why we can't consider a win a win. It worked. They changed. Let their good deeds be good deeds for now. They made a kid's birthday special, no politics, no lobbying, no donations, nothing. They just made a kid's birthday special. \n\n\nClickum245: I was unaware that they had changed their stance on a lot of things. It wasn't something I wanted to actively monitor, so I pretty much wrote them off as a loss after checking that yes, they were (at the time) donating to groups who wanted to push Christian agendas into law.\n\nI'll have to check more into it when I get home, but I am expecting you to be correct.\n"

Results: The angular velocities of SMC Oe/Be stars are on average $<\\Omega/\\Omega_{\\rm c}>=0.95$ in the ZAMS. These velocities are in the area theoretically predicted for the LGRBs progenitors. We estimated the yearly rate per galaxy of LGRBs and the number of LGRBs produced in the local Universe up to z=0.2. We have considered that the mass range of LGRB progenitors corresponds to stars hotter than spectral types B0-B1 and used individual beaming angles from 5 to 15\\degr. We thus obtain $R^{\\rm pred}_{\\rm LGRB}\\sim10^{-7}$ to $\\sim10^{-6}$ LGRBs/year/galaxy, which represents on average 2 to 14 LGRB predicted events in the local Universe during the past 11 years. The predicted rates could widely surpass the observed ones [(0.2-3)$\\times10^{-7}$ LGRBs/year/galaxy; 8 LGRBs observed in the local Universe during the last 11 years] if the stellar counts were made from the spectral type B1-B2, in accordance with the expected apparent spectral types of the appropriate massive fast rotators. Conclusion: We conclude that the massive Be/Oe stars with SMC metallicity could be LGRBs progenitors. Nevertheless, other SMC O/B stars without emission lines, which have high enough specific angular momentum, can enhance the predicted $R_{\\rm LGRB}$ rate."

More recently, information retrieval techniques that exploit overlapping vocabulary between change and tests have proven to be powerful, yet lightweight. In this work, we demonstrate the capabilities of information retrieval for prioritizing tests in dynamic programming languages using Python as example. We discuss and measure previously understudied variation points, including how contextual information around a program change can be used, and design alternatives to the widespread \\emph{TF-IDF} retrieval model tailored to retrieving failing tests. To obtain program changes with associated test failures, we designed a tool that generates a large set of faulty changes from version history along with their test results. Using this data set, we compared existing and new lexical prioritization strategies using four open-source Python projects, showing large improvements over untreated and random test orders and results consistent with related work in statically typed languages. We conclude that lightweight IR-based prioritization strategies are effective tools to predict failing tests in the absence of coverage data or when static analysis is intractable like in dynamic languages. This knowledge can benefit both individual programmers that rely on fast feedback, as well as operators of continuous integration infrastructure, where resources can be freed sooner by detecting defects earlier in the build cycle."

To gain further insights on the influence of tethering on the function of the domains, 4 pairs of homologous protein domains, where one of them is a full-length single-domain protein and the other protein domain is a part of a multi-domain protein, were studied. Analyses showed that identical and structurally equivalent functional residues show differential dynamics in homologous protein domains, though comparable dynamics between in-silico generated chimera protein and multi-domain proteins were observed. From these observations, the differences observed in the functions of homologous proteins could be attributed to the presence of tethered domain.

(although in hindsight this was mainly due to violation of boundaries rather than just the fact that I talked to 3 girls at once) Since then I have become extremely wary of having crushes on multiple girls at once, so since then I restricted myself to having crushes on just one girl at a time.\n\nPlease change this view. I feel like it's keeping me on a crush with someone (even if that crush may not be working out) and preventing me from making a choice if I want to keep going with the existing \"crush\" or move on and find someone else to talk to. I feel like this view acts as a funnel to place all my crushing feelings onto one girl, which would have terrible consequences, and preventing me from finding other people who are actually interested in me. I know this sounds trivial but just hear me out.\n\nCMV\npyrobryan: There's nothing wrong with exploring multiple relationships at once as long as everyone involved understands the situation.  I'm not sure how old you are, but as adults, I think most people understand in the early stages of dating that you have not committed to being exclusive with anyone, and so, are free to explore other relationships.  At some point, most people will either want to take things to the next level or cut their losses and move on.  Whatever the situation, communication is key.\nkingkellogg: Ive never met an adult who dates someone and goes about dating multiple. That's generally considered cheating.\n\nPre dating though, no one cares.\nNdi_Omuntu: Even in the age of dating apps? Like if I matched with 2 interesting people, is it cheating to schedule a first in person date with both of them in the same week?\nfinnjakefionnacake: No. Why would it be? Why would the two people even need to know you went out on a first date with someone else? Also, the majority of people out there / that you're on dates with are doing the same.\n\nNow if you actually commit to someone and are officially dating, and you don't break things off with other people, that's a problem\nNdi_Omuntu: Exactly, just countering the comment I was responding to.\n\n\nThey had a good response though about how variable the definition of \"dating\" is. Like, even if you explicitly say \"let's go on a date\" and meet up to do so does that mean you and this person you just met are \"dating\"?\n\n\nCommunication is everything!\nfinnjakefionnacake: No, going out on a date is different than dating. When you're dating someone, it involves a verbal commitment between the parties involved and boundaries for what that dating means.\n"

Are you refering to changing/spoofing your Modems MAC address? That would in theory work to grab another IP from your ISP as a new MAC would illicit a DHCP request, but most ISPs whitelist modems by the MAC address they require you to give them on first setup. \nauto98: &gt; but most ISPs whitelist modems by the MAC address they require you to give them on first setup.\n\nJust to note that this seems to be a mostly US thing, it doesn't happen in the UK or any other country I have been to.\nThisIsADogHello: I believe the same system works overseas, although in most cases you'll be using a modem provided by your ISP, in which case they already know its MAC address and don't have to ask you for it.\n\nAFAIK, the DOCSIS spec generally only identifies the modem via the modem's MAC address. The only thing really stopping you from spoofing somebody else's MAC is two things: 1. identifying the MAC of a valid customer, and 2. modifying your modem to use this new MAC.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a major deterrent in that it'll be easy for the company to spot that there's two modems claiming to have the same MAC, and they won't have much difficulty in locating which cable segment the modems are on, and send in the police to the location not set as the billing address to deal with some charges of fraud/theft/etc.\nauto98: I work for an ISP, and it definitely isn't the same.  There is no whitelisting of equipment whatsoever, you can plug in what you want.  One company tried MER (MAC encapsulated routing) but it failed badly.\n"

The issue is the installer likely didn't fully set the ends or removed and reset them.  \n\nThe problem, tolerances are so tight with lvp that seperating it breaks the \"lock\". The damage is almost invisible to the naked eye, but easy to realize if you try to seperate damaged pieces again.  \n\n\n*Anyway*, to reuse you'll need to glue each edge. No big deal but a little time consuming. You're local hardware store / amazon will carry vinyl repair glue specifically for floating plank vinyl.\nLawyerStandard9368: Curious why you think they will separate on all 4 sides if removed. Are you saying that in order for the joint to remain locked it can only be put together once?\nGoArray: Basically, yeah. It can be reused, don't get me wrong, they just don't snap lock together as well the second time around.  \n\nThere's usually a tiny lip lock, about 1/16\" of material beveled to allow locking and prevent seperation, this almost always gets rounded / damaged when taking apart.  \n\nSome also have a small bead of adhesive that's single use.  \n\nThe flooring itself should still be good, but you'll need to take extra care to ensure they're locking in place the second time around, perhaps even gluing if the little lock tabs are no longer securing.\nLawyerStandard9368: Interesting. I do warranty repairs for a flooring installation company. Often times when I\u2019m fitting pieces I will engage sections of the planks to dry fit and mark for cuts. With certain, thinner lvps I\u2019ve noticed it is very easy to break tabs and bend the edge of the top layer but I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed the joints not remaining locked after disengaging and reengaging them. I wonder if it\u2019s just with certain products or if I\u2019ll notice these issues overtime. I guess glueing the planks that have been removed would be the safer route to go I would just add that you only need two or three small dabs of glue for the long edges of each plank. I wouldn\u2019t even glue the ends because if all edges are glued the ends can\u2019t separate. Only two or three small dabs of glue will be fine because the planks aren\u2019t going to separate in between glue spots, as that would require it to bend along it\u2019s width which ain\u2019t happenin. Glueing the whole edge seems like massive overkill and would make doing any future repairs a royal pita\nGoArray: Ther trick to what you're doing is not fully locking the planks while dry fitting, it's that last 1/32\" where they actually lock that's 'permanent'.  \n\nYou can do an experiment next time to check for weakening. Lock two sets of 2 pieces together, take one set apart, then put it back together. Try seperating both sets and note any difference.    \n\nEngineered wood is almost always an absolute fail, lvp \"lifeproof\" is hit or miss typically just a weaker lock, cheaper lvp the little raised lock tends to break off or start seperating.   \n\nAnd yeah, I was certainly advising overkill for OP, best to do so I imagine? In reality I tend to just carry a tube of superglue gel, 3 or 4 dots in any edges I'm resetting.\nLawyerStandard9368: Better safe than sorry for sure. Well that\u2019s good to know!

Leaf areas estimated conventionally or with the developed model were used to calculate the leaf expansion and transpiration responses (LER and TR) used in the SUNFLO crop model for 8 sunflower varieties studied. Correlation coefficients of 0.61 and 0.81 for LER and TR respectively validate the use of image-based leaf area estimation. However, the estimated values for LER are lower than for the manual method on Heliaphen, but closer overall to the manual method on greenhouse-grown plants, potentially suggesting an overestimation of stress sensitivity.It can be concluded that the LE and TR parameter estimates can be used for simulations. The low cost of this method (compared with manual measurements), the possibility of parallelizing and repeating measurements on the Heliaphen platform, and of benefiting from the Heliaphen platform's data management, are major improvements for valorizing the SUNFLO model and characterizing the drought sensitivity of cultivated varieties."

We list abstraction, problem decomposition and synthesis, information hiding, reusability, modularity and extensibility as key principles of problem solving and algorithmic thinking. These principles are closely aligned with the advocated computational thinking techniques of problem decomposition, pattern recognition, pattern generalization and algorithm design. We aim for our students to familiarize themselves with all the above principles through practical problem solving. Our ongoing inquiry has been whether the problem domain of pictures is contributing valuably towards this aim. Moreover, an added-value is that students get a glimpse of computational complexity in a visual, empirical way. The presented work is not related to visual programming, since the students write their programs textually and not graphically; it's the output of their programs which is in visual form. Our approach though is loosely related to the classical paradigm of turtle graphics. However, our focus is Computer Science majors, who should be able to design and build turtles and other objects and not just use them. Indeed, the programming principles course helps them to do both and also to appreciate the multitude of algorithmic ways for producing the same visual output. Currently the given programming principles are approached both from a procedural, process-based and an object-oriented, concept-based perspective and the course uses the Java language. Through the presented example problems, we aim to show the appropriateness of the visual domain of pictures for supporting the learning of principled programming. The problem domain of pictures is abundantly rich with potential examples to draw from. Moreover, as reported in the literature, female students may show higher interest towards visual problem domains in programming classes, in relation to other problem domains. We plan to investigate this conjecture in the context of our broader aim to encourage more females to follow university studies in computer science; in this paper only a cursory finding is presented, that bears some relation to what is reported in the literature."

The work you did, while it may eventually break down, should last plenty long enough. The wire mesh you used was a good idea and will help. Next time you should knock out as much rust as possible, seal that area with a good rust preventative paint, hell even rustoleum basic rattle can would work. Then do your body work. Rusting from the inside will eventually leave you with not much to bond to. The mesh, paint, and clear will essential be all thats holding it on after a few months/years.

If I need to redo it at some point, do you have any idea if the product you recommend would work if just worked in from the front?\nSiphor: It would work just fine. It is harder to work with than bondo though. Start with a grater (http://www.antonline.com/p_122-GP_897642.htm?sID=GP&amp;gclid=CP-Y7_eo9rECFWFgTAodZDYApQ) to get it close to flush then sandpaper it moving to finer and finer grit.

In the last 12 cycles solar dynamo has been operating in moderately diffusion dominated regime in the bulk of the convection zone. This means that a part of the poloidal field generated at the surface is advected by the meridional circulation all the way to the poles, down to the tachocline and equatorward to sunspot latitudes, while another part is diffused directly to the tachocline at midlatitudes, \"short-circuiting\" the meridional circulation. The sunspot maximum is the superposition of the two surges of toroidal field generated by these two parts of the poloidal field, which is the explanation of the double peaks and the Gnevyshev gap in sunspot maximum. Near the tachocline, dynamo has been operating in diffusion dominated regime in which diffusion is more important than advection, so with increasing speed of the deep circulation the time for diffusive decay of the poloidal field decreases, and more toroidal field is generated leading to a higher sunspot maximum. During the Maunder minimum the dynamo was operating in advection dominated regime near the tachocline, with the transition from diffusion dominated to advection dominated regime caused by a sharp drop in the surface meridional circulation which is in general the most important factor modulating the amplitude of the sunspot cycle."

I\u2019m not sure on spacing but you can look that up.\nBubbawilcox: The iron frame with the 3/4\" plywood inside will work as the platform for the mattress so no box spring will be needed. The iron frame has a bit of angle iron that extends down below the rest, I'll need to cut a notch into the 2x4 frame if the bed frame so that the iron frame will rest evenly on the 2x4's.\njerkITwithRIGHTYnewb: I\u2019d toss the frame and just put in slats. 1x4 is dirt cheap. Probably cost you $30. Cheaper than plywood and more lightweight. You are planning to use furniture quality plywood on the outside which is more expensive but even a normal piece of plywood and you will need 2 is $35 or more. Plus you will have issues with the seem on the plywood, slats will eliminate that issue. I don\u2019t know about the spacing on that iron frame either. The plywood wood likely sag over time if it\u2019s like the ones I\u2019m thinking of.\nBubbawilcox: I was planning on using 3/4\" T&amp;G plywood glued at the seam and supported by the center angle. You don't think that would be enough to prevent sagging over time better than 1x4 slats? If the center support likely wouldn't be enough I could also add a leg in the middle of that support, or another piece of angle going across the middle of the long side.\n\nI know the plywood would be more costly than usong slats, but my thinking was if another $40-50 would make for a more stable platform it may save me from having to worry about replacing them later. And I'll already be spending a few hundred anyway, another $50 won't kill me for furnature I don't plan on replacing for a long time.\njerkITwithRIGHTYnewb: I\u2019ve never seen a bed frame built with a piece of plywood, put it that way. So I would be worried about sagging.\n"

We propose a Hawkes model with two kernels, one for the endogenous factor (the contagion from other cyber events) and one for the exogenous component (cyber vulnerability publications). We use parametric exponential specifications for both the internal and exogenous intensity kernels, and we compare different methods to tackle the inference problem based on public datasets containing features of cyber attacks found in the Hackmageddon database and cyber vulnerabilities from the Known Exploited Vulnerability database and the National Vulnerability Dataset. By refining the external excitation database selection, the degree of endogeneity of the model is nearly halved. We illustrate our model with simulations and discuss the impact of taking into account the external factor driven by vulnerabilities. Once an attack has occurred, response measures are implemented to limit the effects of an attack. These measures include patching vulnerabilities and reducing the attack's contagion. We use an augmented version of the model by adding a second phase modeling a reduction in the contagion pattern from the remediation measures. Based on this model, we explore various scenarios and quantify the effect of mitigation measures of an insurance company that aims to mitigate the effects of a cyber pandemic in its insured portfolio."

Wipert had one son, also named Wipert (880-900), but it is not clear that Friderada was the mother. Both Bernarius and Wipert were reportedly executed in 883 by Hugh in order to marry the widow, so it is unlikely that they were both Friderada\u2019s husband. Note that Hugh and Wipert were first cousins.\nAn alternative narrative is provided by Jackman. In this analysis, Bernarius was married to a sister of Wipert. Wipert was the guardian of Hugh, and married to Friderada. Bernarius and Wipert were allies of Hugh, but turned against him once his aspirations towards royal succession surfaced, and so Hugh murdered them both and married the widow Friderada."

There is no difference between these two values.  There are several mathematical proofs of varying levels of complexity to prove this.  I've already given the geometric series proof, but you can research others if you don't believe me.\nMWDTech: I'm not arguing that the difference become infinitesimaly small the more decimals you add, I can see the mathematical community has agreed that the convergence to infinity means that .9999 is equal to one. But for all intents and purposes there will always be a remainder of .00000001 (to infinity) it just becomes insignificant.\nJerl: No, that remainder literally stops existing when you converge to infinity.  There is no .00...1 difference. lim_x-&gt;\u221e(1/10^x) = 0.\nMWDTech: It doesn't cease to exist, it just becomes insignificant.\nJerl: No, in the limit it literally becomes zero.\nMWDTech: Limits never reach zero though they just come closer and closer.\nJerl: No, if a limit actually does reach infinity, it does become zero.  A repeating decimal literally is infinitely long, so it reaches zero.\nMWDTech: But the whole point of a limit to infinity is that it cannot reach zero, if zero is the endpoint it is no longer infinite, once you assign and endpoint the value becomes finite.\nJerl: The endpoint isn't zero. The endpoint is infinity. The value in the limit at the endpoint is zero. Limits allow you to get values from endpoints that don't actually exist. This is first week calc 1 stuff. \nMWDTech: So long as zero is never actually reached there will always be a remainder.\nJerl: But it *is* reached - the repeating decimal goes on forever, so it converges to the limit. Convergent series don't *approximate* their convergent value, they **are** their convergent value.

The *entire* series already has its value - it doesn't wait for you to calculate it out or think about it.  The entire, infinite series of zeroes is already all there.  And that's all that's in it.  Zeroes.  There is no one at the end - there was never an end for the one to be at.  The one never existed in the first place.  The entire value of the series is zero.

These tracks have a curled shape, are located at a Teff following the approximate relation Teff=8090+ 32900xY, and become more luminous for larger envelope masses. Consequently, the ZAHB of the very high helium models is \"vertical\" in the HR diagram. Synthetic models based on these tracks nicely reproduce the location and shape of the \"blue hook\" in the globular cluster wCen, best fit by a very high Teff (bluer) sequence with Y=0.80 and a cooler (redder) one with Y=0.65. Although these precise values of Y may depend on the color-Teff conversions, we know that the helium content of the progenitors of the blue hook stars can not be larger than Y~0.38-0.40, if they are descendants of the cluster blue main sequence. Consequently, this interpretation implies that all these objects must in fact be progeny of the blue main sequence, but they have all suffered further deep mixing, that has largely and uniformly increased their surface helium abundance, during the red giant branch evolution. A late helium flash can not be the cause of this deep mixing, as the models we propose have hydrogen rich envelopes much more massive than those required for a late flash. We discuss different models of deep mixing proposed in the literature, and conclude that our interpretation of the blue hook can not be ruled out, but requires a much deeper investigation before it can be accepted."

Eventually, the second stars may provide us with important clues on questions ranging from structure formation to how the stars actually make the elements, not only in the early but also in the present universe. In particular the C-rich extremely metal-poor stars, most of which show the s-process signature, are thought to be associated with chemical yields from the evolved giant phase of intermediate mass stars. Models of such AGB stars at extremely low metallicity now exist, and comparison with observation show important discrepancies, for example with regard to the synthesis of nitrogen. This may hint at burning and mixing aspects of extremely metal-poor evolved stars that are not yet included in the standard picture of evolution, as for example the hydrogen-ingestion flash. The second stars of intermediate mass may have also played an important role in the formation of heavy elements that form through slow neutron capture reaction chains (s-process). Comparison of models with observations reveal which aspects of the physics input and assumptions need to be improved. The s-process is a particularly useful diagnostic tool for probing the physical processes that are responsible for the creation of elements in stars, like for example rotation. As new observational techniques and strategies continue to penetrate the field, for example the multi-object spectroscopy, or the future spectroscopic surveys, the extremely metal-poor stars will play an increasingly important role to address some of the most fundamental and challenging, current questions of astronomy."

It is straightforward to find an expression for the coverage probability of this confidence interval that is a multiple integral of dimension s+1. However, we derive a new elegant and computationally-convenient formula for this coverage probability. For s=2 this formula is a sum of a triple and a double integral and for all s>2 this formula is a sum of a quadruple and a double integral. This makes it easy to compute the minimum coverage probability of the naive confidence interval, irrespective of how large s is. A very important practical application of this formula is to the analysis of covariance. In this context, tau can be defined so that H_0 expresses the hypothesis of \"parallelism\". Applied statisticians commonly recommend carrying out a preliminary F test of this hypothesis. We illustrate the application of our formula with a real-life analysis of covariance data set and a preliminary F test for \"parallelism\". We show that the naive 0.95 confidence interval has minimum coverage probability 0.0846, showing that it is completely inadequate."

All of these are existing DSLs where we replaced the backend using Sham, resulting in major performance gains. We present an example-driven description of how Sham can smoothly enhance an existing DSL into a high-performance one. When compared to existing approaches for implementing high-performance DSLs, Sham's design aims for both simplicity and programmer control. This makes it easier to port our techniques to other languages and frameworks, or borrow Sham's innovations \"\\`a la carte\" without adopting the whole approach. Sham builds a sophisticated and powerful DSL construction toolkit atop fundamental language features including higher-order functions, data structures, and a foreign-function interface (FFI), all readily available in other languages.

If you create a subreddit, I will gladly follow it - there not too many people who realize what a great deal it is to build your own house. \nphylet: Ill do most of it by myself, i might hire day labour ocasionally or have friends help for as many hours as they care to; Basically it will be mostly me, but i dont have to worry about things that are impossible solo.\nthews: I have had to use help several times.  I have done the majority of things myself, but some things are best left to people who are very skilled at those things.   I had to have people help with concrete forming and pouring, and drywall finishing.   \n\nI did a lot of drywall myself, but it isn't very pleasant, and I don't really have the knack for it.  \nphylet: I would 100% be ok with having someone work the concrete. I expect to buy ready-mix, which comes with the truck and crew anyway so i see no other way of doing it, plus, my buddy is high in a local concrete firm, so he will look after me.\nthews: One of my friends owns a shipping company and has dump trucks and connections with concrete companies.   He returns some of my favors with letting his employees help me out some.  I didn't have to do any of the rebar work or pay for the concrete getting poured or the crew to do the finishing.  I did help out some on the digging of the footings.   A guy brought over a tractor, and I had watered the area down for a day so it wasn't  huge struggle to dig out the footers.  The tractor just helped do some grading and move sand around for the middle of the foundation.  \n"

        "text": " foam seems very messy.\n\nAdvice??\n5degreenegativerake: The tried and true method is to staple rafter vent to the roof deck in every rafter space and then cover with fiber batts. This allows air to flow from your vented soffit to your (should be vented) ridge, allowing any moisture on your roof deck to be carried away.\n\nOnce you get into spray foam, you will have a huge pissing match between the old school guys and the new school guys. Cathedral ceilings are notorious for mold at the peak. Any tiny little air leak in the insulation will allow warm moist air to hit the cold roof deck and condense, leading to eventual rot and roof failure. It can be done right on an unvented roof but it MUST be done right or it will fail. I personally have a cathedral ceiling I insulated myself with rigid foam board, urethane sealant and spray can foam.\n\nIf you want to go this route, look up \u201cbuilding science\u201d and follow their guidelines to the letter. You have to have perfect air sealing, your air seal needs to be in the right place and you have to do a meticulous job. You WILL get mold if you have any air leaks at all, like a single outlet box that is not entirely encapsulated with sealant.\nrandolph51: Ok let\u2019s talk about a few things.The moisture occurs when warm air from inside hits the cold air under the shingles, or coming in through any small air leak in the roof. Then condensation forms, and gathers against the rafters or the roof sheathing. \n\nand the venting is  supposed to take any moisture up and out of the ridge vent, so as not to sit on the insulation, drywall, or underside of the plywood.\n\nSo the foam should totally encapsulate all wood surfaces, and fill all voids in the system so warm air NEVER hits the cold rafters or plywood, and therefore never condenses, and therefore no moisture gathers, and a venting system is moot. \n\nThere is no ridge vent, I would have to make one. There is no gable vent, and the peak is too low to make a plenum anyway. \nThe garage below is currently unheated. The loft is  going to get a heatpump hvac. \n\nSo if I totally encapsulte the roof, add sheetrock, It should act as one solid member, and moisture managment is unecessary.  \n\nIs that correct??\n\nOne more thing- Is the airflow in a vented roof system supposed to help draw away hot air in The summer? Does the 1inch airspace under the shingles help cool the space below?\n\n\nAnd if done \u201cright\u201d i can accomplish a total seal with: rigid foam board 2-3\u201d, construction adhesive, cans of spray foam?  \nOR just suck it up and hire a foam guy??\n5degreenegativerake: Yes, your understanding on all is correct. As is often the case, the devil is in the details. If done 100% correct you will have no issues. I got a steal of a deal on 2\u201d foil faced polyiso so I went with that. I think professional spray foam is still superior, but my project was like $40k for spray foam or $7k on the foam board. You are trading shitloads of labor for some dollars. On a smaller project I would definitely pay the pros, and it needs to be closed cell.\nrandolph51: I got it. Thanks for the words.\n"

It's sorta how \"gas-lighting\" has replaced the word \"lying\" for some people, even though they're very different things. Throwing around these psychiatric terms without really understanding the severity and nuances associated with them leads to a lot of misuse and improper self-diagnosis.\nUntap_Phased: Actually, daydreaming is a mild form of dissociation. Dissociation is not inherently \u201cneurotic,\u201d but only becomes so when it interferes with your functioning. All human beings dissociate and we need to escape reality like that sometimes as a coping mechanism. Although it is true PTSD and depression do cause exacerbated/extreme dissociation on a clinical level.\nYardLongKingKongDong: This is clearly not what was meant with a very clinical, textbook definition provided for dissociation.\nUntap_Phased: It is likely that the clinical definition refers specifically to clinical dissociation proper and not the broader term of \u201cdissociation.\u201d The vast majority of instances of dissociation are not diagnosed because they don\u2019t interfere with one\u2019s functioning - otherwise they\u2019d be hospitalizing everyone who went to a movie theater. I\u2019m a mental health professional who has worked with people with severe trauma, anxiety and depression so I am informed on the subject. It\u2019s important to realize that mental health issues are on a spectrum and that what neurotypical people experience is not always a completely alien thing to what those with mental health issues experience.\nvladimirraul: Well-said and a very important point!\n"

        "text": ", I derived the Toomre Q parameter, which characterizes the stability of their gaseous and stellar phases. I find that the fraction of UV-selected clumpy galaxies at z~0.6 is 20+/-12%. Roughly half of them (45+/-30%) have complex kinematics inconsistent with Jeans-unstable disks, while those in the remaining half (55+/-30%) show large-scale rotations. The latter reveal a stable gaseous phase, but the contribution of their stellar phase makes them globally unstable to clump formation. Clumpy galaxies appear to be less unstable at z~0.6 than at z~2, which could explain why the UV clumps tend to vanish in rest-frame optical images of z~0.6 clumpy galaxies, conversely to z~2 clumpy galaxies, in which the stellar phase can substantially fragment. This suggests that the former correspond to patchy star-formation regions superimposed on a smoother mass distribution. A possible and widespread scenario for driving clump formation relies on instabilities by cold streams penetrating the dark matter halos where clumpy galaxies inhabit. While such a gas accretion process is predicted to be significant in massive, z~2 haloes, it is also predicted to be strongly suppressed in similar, z~0.6 haloes, which could explain why lowest-z clumpy galaxies appear to be driven by a different mechanism. Instead, I found that interactions are probably the dominant driver leading to the formation of clumpy galaxies at z<1. I argue that the nature of z>1 clumpy galaxies remains more uncertain. While cold flows could be an important driver at z~2, I also argue that the observed and cumulative merger fraction between z=2 and z=3 is large enough so that every z~2 galaxy might be the result of a merger that occurred within their past 1 Gyr. I conclude that it is premature to rule out mergers as a universal driver for galaxy evolution from z~2 down to z=0."

Moreover the magnetic Fredericksz threshold exhibits non-monotonic behaviour as a function of the nanoparticle concentration for both types of nanoparticles, first decreasing down to a value from 23\\% to 31\\% below that of pure 5CB, then increasing with a further increase of nanoparticle concentration. This is interpreted as an aggregation starting at around 0.02 weight fraction that consumes more isolated nanoparticles than those introduced when the concentration is increased above $c = 0.05$ weight fraction (volume fraction $3.5 \\times 10^{-2}$). This shows the larger effect of isolated nanoparticles on the threshold with respect to aggregates. From dynamic light scattering measurements we deduced that, if the decrease of the magnetic threshold when the nanoparticle concentration increases is similar for both kinds of nanoparticles, the origin of this decrease is different for magnetic and non-magnetic nanoparticles. For non-magnetic nanoparticles, the behavior may be associated with a decrease of the elastic constant due to weak planar anchoring. For magnetic nanoparticles there are non-negligible local magnetic interactions between liquid crystal molecules and magnetic nanoparticles, leading to an increase of the average order parameter. This magnetic interaction thus favors an easier liquid crystal director rotation in the presence of external magnetic field, able to reorient the magnetic moments of the nanoparticles along with the molecules."

The variance of the estimations and the efficiency of the estimator were studied based on the Cram{\\'e}r-Rao lower bound.Column densities can be estimated with 30% accuracy, while the best estimations of the volume density are found to be within a factor of two.

The Squires government collapsed and Alderdice swept to power in the ensuing June election on the promise that if elected, his government would examine the possibility of suspending the constitution and having a commission administer the country until conditions improved. His United Newfoundland Party won 24 seats to only two for the Liberals.\nThe Alderdice government was unable to deal with the economic crisis and proposed a partial default on the dominion's debts. Britain and Canada (whose currency was shared by Newfoundland) agreed to give the dominion financial aid in exchange for the creation of an Imperial Royal Commission to investigate the dominion's future. The Commission recommended the suspension of responsible government and the institution of an appointed Commission of Government to rule the dominion.\nAlderdice was pressured by the British to accept the recommendations without calling a new election or submitting the proposals to a referendum. Alderdice agreed and, at the end of 1933, the legislature voted to accept the recommendations and voted itself out of existence. Alderdice was appointed to the Commission of Government when it was established in February 1934 and served  as Commissioner for Home Affairs and Education in the new Commission of Government as well as Vice-Chairman until his death in 1936.\n\n"

Moreover, we find that ambipolar diffusion, not Ohmic dissipation, is responsible for decoupling all the species except the electrons from the magnetic field, by a density \\approx 3 x 10^12 cm^-3. Magnetic decoupling precedes the formation of a central stellar object and ultimately gives rise to a concentration of magnetic flux (a `magnetic wall') outside the hydrostatic core --- as also found by Tassis & Mouschovias (2005a,b) through a different approach. At approximately the same density at which Ohmic dissipation becomes more important than ambipolar diffusion (\\gtrsim 7 x 10^12 cm^-3), the grains carry most of the electric charge as well as the electric current. The prestellar core remains disclike down to radii ~ 10 AU, inside which thermal pressure becomes important. The magnetic flux problem of star formation is resolved for at least strongly magnetic newborn stars by this stage of the evolution, i.e., by a central density \\approx 10^14 cm^-3. The hydrostatic core has radius \\approx 2 AU, density \\approx 10^14 cm^-3, temperature \\approx 300 K, magnetic field strength \\approx 0.2 G, magnetic flux \\approx 5 x 10^18 Wb, luminosity ~ 10^-3 L_\\odot, and mass ~ 10^-2 M_\\odot."

The biggest barrier is money and access, so the conversation turns to that.\n\nThe second camp are people who wouldn\u2019t be happy going to a prostitute, because they want a genuine connection with the woman they\u2019re having sex with. I find that in a lot of these conversations, the desire for sex is a proxy for the desire to be desired.\n\nWhich of these two camps feels closer to where you are in your situation?\n[deleted]: The second camp definitely\nBotAtHackEr: Ah, got it, so it sounds like, in addition to sex, having a girlfriend is also about feeling desired. If it\u2019s the second camp, my guess it\u2019s not just sexual desire either, but more of a general \u201cI want someone who cares about me.\u201d Is that more or less accurate?\n[deleted]: Yes\nBotAtHackEr: Hm if that\u2019s the case, then the first thing I end up thinking about is, what are other ways to get what you want, i.e. someone who cares about you? I think a girlfriend can be that person, but I also feel like friends can also fill that role. \n\nObviously friends can\u2019t provide sex, so there\u2019s that caveat. But I feel like having a friend who cares about you is pretty similar to having a girlfriend who cares about you. What are the biggest differences for you?\n[deleted]: The biggest difference is definitely sex. But also the intimacy really\nBotAtHackEr: Yeah, sex is a big one. What do you mean by intimacy, like physical? Emotional?\n[deleted]: Both\nBotAtHackEr: Yeah, being physically intimate with friends isn\u2019t really an option for a lot of people. Emotionally though, it might be comparable.\n\nWhat would it look like to be emotionally intimate with someone? Is that something you could try with a friend?\n[deleted]: Well I guess I could be emotionally intimate with a friend. Although for me it would be liking me for who I am really.\nBotAtHackEr: That\u2019s a reasonable thing to want, and I feel like a friend, a good one at least, should like you for who you are. It\u2019d be a red flag if they didn\u2019t. Do you feel like you have someone who likes for you who you are, friend or not?\n[deleted]: I do have family, but no friends.\nBotAtHackEr: Ah, that would make things difficult, and it makes more sense to me now why intimacy is important to you.\n\nMy first thought is that it might help more to focus on making friends right now. For me, girlfriends are a subsection of friends, meaning if finding friends is hard, then finding a girlfriend will be even harder. I\u2019ve met people who were great friends but terrible as SOs. I\u2019ve never met anyone who was a great SO but a bad friend.\n\nI do believe that if you meet a friend who cares about you, then you\u2019ll feel a lot happier and readier to look for a girlfriend.\n"

If it's just the office, a small fan does make the difference, depending on how you direct it.  Try the small fan in the doorway, but put it up near the ceiling and blowing out from your office.  This will suck out the hot air by the ceiling and also lower the office air pressure a little, causing cold air to flow in below.\n\nI've always had more luck trying to blow warm air away than cold air in anyway.\nRugerRedhawk: I dunno, lots of homes have floor registers in them don't they? Maybe they're against some type of fire code, but I know they are quite common in houses that heat with a wood stove. \nnosoupforyou: Floor registers?  Afaik they all sit over ducting.  In my own home, the ducts go to each room and the register sits on it to keep dirt and items from falling into the ducts.\nRugerRedhawk: If you have forced air yes, but if you have a wood stove in the basement many times you'll just have holes cut in the floor with a vent. Hot air rises, floor registers help it rise more evenly to different parts of the house. Maybe \"lots\" was a bit much, since there are far more homes with furnaces and boilers, but if your primary heat is a traditional wood stove, floor registers are common. Perhaps they're against fire code, I have no idea. Lots of things that are against code are common.

Someone else posted that you are supposed to seal the opening around the cable.  \nRugerRedhawk: Yeah, perhaps you're supposed to, but in all the wiring I've done I've never done it, or had anybody tell me I was supposed to do it. Think of all the romex that runs up through the bottom wall plates. Perhaps there is good reason for it, this is honestly just news to me. \nnosoupforyou: Honestly I think some of the fire codes are overdone.  I can see not wanting to have holes in floors where the risk of a fire below could happen, but the risk of a fire in the basement is pretty low.\n\nUsually fires start in the kitchen or the garage.  I guess it's not impossible to start in the basement, but the firecodes don't really consider odds. It's just the same for everywhere in the house.\n"

While up it would need to support roughly 100-150lbs just on this hinges that are rated for up to 210lbs. When down the frame will rest on the 2x4 frame and 4x4 legs, it would need to support roughly up to 600lbs between the mattress, bedding, and 2 people sleeping on it.\n\nI will need to notch the 2x4 frame where the bottom angle iron support will come below the frame of the bed but I didn't put that into the sketch up model. Are there any noticeable significant issues I have missed or overlooked with this? My main concern is the frame the mattress will sit on, but I have not been able to find much info on what kind of weight can be expected from something like 1.5\" angle.\njerkITwithRIGHTYnewb: You need slats across the opening where the mattress will sit or you\u2019re sayin you\u2019re going to seat the iron frame into it? If your using a box spring that will be fine otherwise you will want to just make 1x4 slats to support the mattress. I\u2019m not sure on spacing but you can look that up.\nBubbawilcox: The iron frame with the 3/4\" plywood inside will work as the platform for the mattress so no box spring will be needed. The iron frame has a bit of angle iron that extends down below the rest, I'll need to cut a notch into the 2x4 frame if the bed frame so that the iron frame will rest evenly on the 2x4's.\njerkITwithRIGHTYnewb: I\u2019d toss the frame and just put in slats. 1x4 is dirt cheap. Probably cost you $30. Cheaper than plywood and more lightweight. You are planning to use furniture quality plywood on the outside which is more expensive but even a normal piece of plywood and you will need 2 is $35 or more. Plus you will have issues with the seem on the plywood, slats will eliminate that issue. I don\u2019t know about the spacing on that iron frame either. The plywood wood likely sag over time if it\u2019s like the ones I\u2019m thinking of.\nBubbawilcox: I was planning on using 3/4\" T&amp;G plywood glued at the seam and supported by the center angle. You don't think that would be enough to prevent sagging over time better than 1x4 slats? If the center support likely wouldn't be enough I could also add a leg in the middle of that support, or another piece of angle going across the middle of the long side.\n\nI know the plywood would be more costly than usong slats, but my thinking was if another $40-50 would make for a more stable platform it may save me from having to worry about replacing them later. And I'll already be spending a few hundred anyway, another $50 won't kill me for furnature I don't plan on replacing for a long time.\njerkITwithRIGHTYnewb: I\u2019ve never seen a bed frame built with a piece of plywood, put it that way.

Perhaps it should be said that if you are an amateur, or unfamiliar with safe, best practices and are not a regular user then by all means, take every precaution.  However, professionals, people who especially work outside building and maintaining the structures that you live in and work and play in wear gloves on a regular basis while they are cutting and assembling materials.    Maybe it's excessively cold out, or handling treated lumber all day, day in and day out.  Nobody should be handling treating lumber on a regular basis bare-handed.  There are all kinds of reasons why people who use tools on a daily basis wear gloves.   Safely, too.  I've been doing it for almost 20 years, and the only time I've ever hurt myself on a construction jobsite was with a chisel that would have been stopped if I had been wearing my gloves! \n\nI always use and recommend good quality gloves, of course, that fit well and don't have any fraying hanging things.

For shame.\n\n\n\nSwarley_Chaplin: You should still never wear gloves while operating a table saw, a guard is not necessary but using gloves is retarded. They are perfectly fine for job site use though, just not tablesaws. Spreading thoughts like this is how people new to woodworking lose all their fingers while operating equipment unsafely.\njmorrisweb: More important than a guard is a riving knife. Especially for someone new, as it limits the ability to create a kickback situation tho not entirely. I have gotten to the point of relying on it, once you push a piece through you no longer have to keep as much pressure on the side and can worry about the feed rate. Without it, I seem to have to hold the piece much more (I use two wood push sticks) I don't like keeping that amount of pressure, I am not quite leaning into it or anything but it's enough if the sticks got ate from under me I don't know if I would be maintaining a comfortable distance. \n\nThat said I could see something like vinyl gloves maybe(they rip easy) but that's pretty much it I rather touch treated lumber than lose a whole hand. Gloves and moving parts simply are not [OSHA](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3170.pdf) and it's only mentioned like 11 times there are also many reports of full hand or practically full hand amputations. I can see the argument of hands shouldn't be that close to the blade, I personally don't like to stack mistakes. I am sure compounded mistakes are how many freak accidents happen.\n"

When Ficker entrusted the youthful scholar with the revision of the Carolingian period of B\u00f6hmer's \"Regesta\", he was directing him to a domain in which he was to do much work. In 1878 he was formally received as academical lecturer into the philosophical faculty of the University of Innsbruck, and between 1880 and 1889 published his edition of the imperial \"Regesta\" of the Carolingian period. As Oswald Redlich says, \"the technique of compiling regesta received exemplary development at M\u00fchlbacher's hands, and his work served as a model for the entire new edition of the imperial Regesta\".\nIn 1892 M\u00fchlbacher was entrusted with the editing of the Carolingian charters for the Monumenta Germani\u00e6 Historica. At the same time it became necessary to bring out a new edition of his Carolingian \"Regesta\". The two works proved of mutual assistance. He was able to see only the first part of each work through the press, but left considerable material for the use of his successors. No other German scholar was so well qualified to write the Deutsche Geschichte unter den Karolingern, which appeared in 1896. After 1879 M\u00fchlbacher edited the Mitteilungen des Instituts f\u00fcr \u00f6sterreichische Geschichtsforschung (Publications of the Institute for Austrian Historical Research). In 1881 he was appointed extraordinary, and in 1896 ordinary professor at Vienna. In 1895 Ficker turned over to him the management of the Regesta Imperii. He took in hand the arrangement of the Austrian State Archives, and the preparation of the more recent history of Austria. He was chosen an active member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna.\nWhen M\u00fchlbacher died in Vienna at age 59 of pneumonia, he left the almost completed manuscript of his edition of the charters of Pepin the Short, Carloman I and Charlemagne. This volume was published posthumously in 1906 (Die Urkunden Pippins, Karlmanns und Karls des Gro\u00dfen, MGH Diplomata Karolinorum I, book in digital form) and is the authoritative edition of the charters of these three kings until today."

In fact, each group shows its own fundamental plane, which is more loosely defined for less diversified groups. We conclude that the global fundamental plane is not a bent surface, but made of a collection of several groups characterizing several fundamental planes with different thicknesses and orientations in the parameter space. Our diversification scenario probably indicates that the level of diversity is linked to the number and the nature of transforming events and that the fundamental plane is the result of several transforming events. We also show that our classification, not the fundamental planes, is universal within our redshift range (0.007 - 0.053). We find that the three groups with the thinnest fundamental planes presumably formed through dissipative (wet) mergers. In one of them, this(ese) merger(s) must have been quite ancient because of the relatively low metallicity of its galaxies, Two of these groups have subsequently undergone dry mergers to increase their masses. In the k-space, the third one clearly occupies the region where bulges (of lenticular or spiral galaxies) lie and might also have formed through minor mergers and accretions. The two least diversified groups probably did not form by major mergers and must have been strongly affected by interactions, some of the gas in the objects of one of these groups having possibly been swept out. The interpretation, based on specific assembly histories of galaxies of our seven groups, shows that they are truly homologous. They were obtained directly from several observables, thus independently of any a priori classification. The diversification scenario relating these groups does not depend on models or numerical simulations, but is objectively provided by the cladistic analysis. Consequently, our classification is more easily compared to models and numerical simulations, and our work can be readily repeated with additional observables."

New revolutionary features including terahertz (THz) communications and the integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) can further improve the performance and signal quality for future 6G networks. However, despite the inevitable benefits of all these key technologies, the heterogeneous and ultra-flexible structure of the 5G and beyond network brings non-orthogonality into the system and generates significant interference that needs to be handled carefully. Therefore, it is essential to design effective interference management schemes to mitigate severe and sometimes unpredictable interference in mobile networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of interference management in 5G and Beyond networks and discuss its future evolution. We start with a unified classification and a detailed explanation of the different types of interference and continue by presenting our taxonomy of existing interference management approaches. Then, after explaining interference measurement reports and signaling, we provide for each type of interference identified, an in-depth literature review and technical discussion of appropriate management schemes. We finish by discussing the main interference challenges that will be encountered in future 6G networks and by presenting insights on the suggested new interference management approaches, including useful guidelines for an AI-based solution. This review will provide a first-hand guide to the industry in determining the most relevant technology for interference management, and will also allow for consideration of future challenges and research directions."

None of the studs in that picture have horizontal cross bracing right where the two sheets of drywall meet, which is what I've been trying to say all along.  As such, there are no nails there (as there is nothing into which to drive them).  Judging by OP's picture, his roof joists probably run in a similar direction to how mine run, and thus there is too large a span without screws to hold the joint together.  If I were the guy that had done OP's ceiling, I'd have added some sort of brace across that seam.\n\nThe same has probably happened to OP's ceiling, which is all I've said, but instead of going with it, you've attempted (poorly) to instead try to claim what I said was wrong, when it clearly isn't.\n\nAs to nails -- I personally never use nails in drywall.

A forward-backward divergence segmentation and a clustering algorithm were used to compute, for each sentence, four automatic predictors of speech fluency: pseudo-syllable rate, speech ratio, rate of silent breaks, and standard deviation of pseudo-syllable length. The four predictors were finally combined into multivariate regression models (a multiplelinear regression - MLR, and two non-linear models) to predict the average SLP ratings of speech fluency, using a leave-one speaker-out validation scheme. Outcomes & Results: All models achieved accurate predictions of speech fluency ratings, with average root-mean-square errors as low as 0.5. The MLR yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.87 with reference ratings at the sentence level, and of 0.93 when aggregating the data for each participant. The inclusion of an additional predictor sensitive to repetitions improved further the predictions with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 at the sentence level, and of 0.96 at the participant level. Conclusions: The algorithms used in this study can constitute a cost-effective and reliable tool for the assessment of the speech fluency of patients with aphasia in read-aloud tasks.

In the way of resampling, it can mitigate the impact of the changed features on positioning and enables to retrieve accurate location estimation. The users location is robustly computed by identifying the candidate locations from these intermediate ones using modified Jaccardindex (MJI) and the feature-wise change belief is calculated according to the world model of the RFM and the estimated variability of features. In order to validate our proposed approach, two levels of experimental analysis have been carried out. On the simulated dataset, the average change detection accuracy is about 90%. Meanwhile, the improvement of positioning accuracy within 2 m is about 20% by dropping out the features that are detected as changed when performing positioning comparing to that of using all measured features for location estimation.

These characteristics pose a barrier for application developers to understand the engine on top of which their own code runs, and fosters a knowledge gap that prevents application developers to change the VM. We propose Live Metacircular Runtimes (LMRs) to overcome this problem. LMRs are language runtime systems that seamlessly integrate the VM into the application in live programming environments. Unlike classic metacircular approaches, we propose to completely remove the separation between application and VM. By systematically applying object-oriented design to VM components, we can build live runtime systems that are small and flexible enough, where VM engineers can benefit of live programming features such as short feedback loops, and application developers with fewer VM expertise can benefit of the stronger causal connections between their programs and the VM implementation. To evaluate our proposal, we implemented Bee/LMR, a live VM for a Smalltalk-derivative environment in 22057 lines of code. We analyze case studies on tuning the garbage collector, avoiding recompilations by the just-in-time compiler, and adding support to optimize code with vector instructions to demonstrate the trade-offs of extending exploratory programming to VM development in the context of an industrial application used in production. Based on the case studies, we illustrate how our approach facilitates the daily development work of a small team of application developers. Our approach enables VM developers to gain access to live programming tools traditionally reserved for application developers, while application developers can interact with the VM and modify it using the high-level tools they use every day. Both application and VM developers can seamlessly inspect, debug, understand, and modify the different parts of the VM with shorter feedback loops and higher-level tools."

We reduced archival radio continuum observations obtained with the Very Large Array using standard calibration and imaging methods and complemented these with pre-reduced \\changes observations as well as observations obtained with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and LOw Frequency ARray. For the analysis of AT 2000ch, we consider the optical light curve and color evolution, its radio continuum brightness at different frequencies and times, and the corresponding spectral indices. We estimated mass-loss rates and optical depths based on radio continuum brightnesses and Ha fluxes. We report two newly detected outbursts of AT 2000ch similar to those found in the 2000s and 13 re-brightening events, of which at least four are not conclusively detected because of insufficient sampling of the light curve. The dates of all outbursts and significant, well-sampled re-brightening events are consistent with a period of $\\sim 201 \\pm 12\\,$days over a total time-span of two decades. Such a behavior has never been found for any SN imposter, especially not for candidate SN~2009ip analogs. During 2010 to 2012 and 2014 to 2018, we only have a few detections, which is insufficient to come to any conclusion as to a possible less eruptive phase of the transient. We find steady dimming after the most recent re-brightening events and possible evidence of porosity in the circumstellar envelope, suggesting AT~2000ch may currently be in transition to a state of relative calm. We identified a second, unrelated source at a projected distance of $\\sim 23\\,$pc ($\\sim0.5^{\\prime\\prime}$) that has contaminated the optical measurements of AT~2000ch at its minimum luminosity over the last two decades probably on a $5\\%-10\\,\\%$ level, but this does not affect our overall findings and is negligible during re-brightening. We are able to restrict the mass-loss rate of AT~2000ch to range between several $10^{-6}\\,\\textrm{M}_{\\odot}/\\textrm{yr}$ and several $10^{-5}\\,\\textrm{M}_{\\odot}/\\textrm{yr}$. The fresh ejecta appear to be optically thick to radio continuum emission at least within the first $\\sim 25\\,$days after significant re-brightening."

We compared our results to the predictions of UV-dominated chemical models of photodissociation regions (PDR models) and to those of non-equilibrium models in which the chemistry is driven by the dissipation of turbulent energy (TDR models). Results. The molecular column densities of all the velocity components span up to two orders of magnitude. Those of CN, HCN, and HNC are linearly correlated with each other with mean ratios N(HCN)/N(HNC) = 4.8 $\\pm$ 1.3 and N(CN)/N(HNC) = 34 $\\pm$ 12, and more loosely correlated with those of HCO+, N(HNC)/N(HCO+) = 0.5 $\\pm$ 0.3, N(HCN)/N(HCO+) = 1.9 $\\pm$ 0.9, and N(CN)/N(HCO+) = 18 $\\pm$ 9. These ratios are similar to those inferred from observations of high Galactic latitude lines of sight, suggesting that the gas sampled by absorption lines in the Galactic plane has the same chemical properties as that in the Solar neighbourhood. The FWHM of the Gaussian velocity components span the range 0.3 to 3 km s-1 and those of the HCO+ lines are found to be 30% broader than those of CN-bearing molecules. The PDR models fail to reproduce simultaneously the observed abundances of the CN-bearing species and HCO+, even for high-density material (100 cm-3 < nH < 104 cm-3). The TDR models, in turn, are able to reproduce the observed abundances and abundance ratios of all the analysed molecules for the moderate gas densities (30 cm-3 < nH < 200 cm-3) and the turbulent energy observed in the diffuse interstellar medium. Conclusions. Intermittent turbulent dissipation appears to be a promising driver of the gas phase chemistry of the diffuse and translucent gas throughout the Galaxy. The details of the dissipation mechanisms still need to be investigated."

For instance, the reader will see how the Gramian controllability condition is expressed in infinite dimension, and leads to the celebrated Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM). Except the very last section, in the second part I have only considered linear autonomous control systems (the theory is already quite complicated), providing anyway several references to other textbooks for the several techniques existing to treat some particular classes of nonlinear PDEs. In contrast, in the first part on finite-dimensional control theory, there are much less difficulties to treat general nonlinear control systems, and I give here some general results on controllability, optimal control and stabilization. Of course, whether in finite or infinite dimension, there exist much finer results and methods in the literature, established however for specific classes of control systems. Here, my objective is to provide the reader with an introduction to control theory and to the main tools allowing to treat general control systems. I hope this will serve as motivation to go deeper into the theory or numerical aspects that are not covered here."

The last thing I bought was some hydrolyzed silk protein that I add to my hair and skin moisturizers. I also sometimes buy fragrances and flavors to add to existing products.\n\nThe thing is, you have to use common sense or do your own research. I'm just a consumer with zero experience in product development. If you want to get serious, you can contact M.C. for help with any formulation. They sell containers and applicators, etc. If you are so inclined, you could create your own line of products.

E.g. the inclusion of water in products providing the environment for bacteria etc to grow.  I find the idea of making my own products very appealing but for things like cosmetics I feel like there's a lot that can go wrong if you don't know what you're doing (not saying you don't know what you're doing, I mean in a more general sense).\nZestfullyclean87: The first thing that comes to mind is fragrance oils.  A lot of those oils can become very dangerous if they come in contact with certain cleaning products (such as bleach)\n\nAll it takes is someone to throw a used towel with bleach on it, into a laundry basket with other towels with the wrong oils, maybe you have used that towel to wipe up  the ingredients you used to make soap, homemade lotion.  You can burn down your home\nBruceInc: That makes very little sense and the likelihood of it happening is zero. Bleach reacts with ammonia which isn\u2019t a likely ingredient in a skin care product.\nZestfullyclean87: I literally know someone that this happened to.  They used bleach to wash rags that were used to clean up fragrance oil.  The heat from the dryer made it worse, so it wasn\u2019t an immediate thing, but over the next day or so they had smoke filling up the house and the fire dept discovered the towels burning through the box it was sitting in\nBruceInc: Some Essential oils have very low flashpoint.

I\u2019m talking fragrance oils, which are often very different - something you would use *just* for the fragrance\n\nAn essential oil is when you take a concentrated essence from something (like flowers, lemons, peppermint).  They may have a natural fragrance, but fragrance oils are not the same as essential oils.  Raw fragrance oils are flammable \n\nOnce they\u2019re mixed in with something like a skincare product it\u2019s fine, but if you wiped up spilled oil with a rag, don\u2019t use bleach.\n"

Comm. Probab. 8 (2003) 77--85]. Here we present another such variant which seems to be the most natural one for this particular class of problems. To find the eigenvalues for the general case of the second class of problems is difficult, so we restrict attention to two special cases. In the first case the card that is moved to the top is picked uniformly at random from the bottom $k=k(n)=o(n)$ cards, and we find the lower bound $(n^3/(4\\pi^2k(k-1)))\\log n$. Via a coupling, an upper bound exceeding this by only a factor 4 is found. This generalizes Wilson's [Electron. Comm. Probab. 8 (2003) 77--85] result on the Rudvalis shuffle and Goel's [Ann. Appl. Probab. 16 (2006) 30--55] result on top-to-bottom shuffles. In the second case the card moved to the top is, with probability 1/2, the bottom card and with probability 1/2, the card at position $n-k$. Here the lower bound is again of order $(n^3/k^2)\\log n$, but in this case this does not seem to be tight unless $k=O(1)$. What the correct order of mixing is in this case is an open question.

Results: The quasi totality of the mass of CH$^+$ originates from the unstable gas, in environments where the kinetic temperature is larger than 600 K, the density ranges between 0.6 and 10 cm$^{-3}$, the electronic fraction ranges between 3 x 10$^{-4}$ and 6 x 10$^{-3}$, and the molecular fraction is smaller than 0.4. Its formation is driven by warm and out-of-equilibrium H$_2$ initially formed in the cold neutral medium (CNM) and injected in more diffuse environments and even the warm neutral medium (WNM) through a combination of advection and thermal instability. The simulation which displays the tightest agreement with the HI-to-H$_2$ transition and the thermal pressure distribution observed in the Solar Neighborhood is found to naturally reproduce the observed abundances of CH$^+$, the dispersion of observations, the probability of occurrence of most of the lines of sight, the fraction of non-detections of CH$^+$, and the distribution of its line profiles. The amount of CH$^+$ and the statistical properties of the simulated lines of sight are set by the fraction of unstable gas rich in H$_2$ which is controlled, on Galactic scales, by the mean density of the diffuse ISM (or, equivalently, its total mass), the amplitude of the mean UV radiation field, and the strength of the turbulent forcing. Conclusions: This work offers a new and natural solution to an 80 years old chemical riddle. The almost ubiquitous presence of CH$^+$ in the diffuse ISM likely results from the exchanges of matter between the CNM and the WNM induced by the combination of turbulent advection and thermal instability, without the need to invoke ambipolar diffusion or regions of intermittent turbulent dissipation. Through two phase turbulent mixing, CH$^+$ might thus be a tracer of the H$_2$ mass loss rate of CNM clouds."

The static analysis of security policies is then obtained from the RASP mechanism by first statically analyzing the base program without any traps. The results of this first phase are used in a second phase to detect trapped operations and abstractly execute the associated and unaltered RASP policy enforcement code. Knowledge: Splitting the analysis into two phases enables running each phase with a specific analysis configuration, rendering the static analysis approach tractable while maintaining sufficient precision. Grounding: We validate the applicability of our two-phase analysis approach by using it to both dynamically enforce and statically detect a range of security policies found in related work. Our experiments suggest that our two-phase analysis can enable faster and more precise policy violation detection compared to analyzing the full instrumented application under a single analysis configuration. Importance: Deriving a SAST component from a RASP mechanism enables equivalent semantics for the security policies across the static and dynamic contexts in which policies are verified during the software development lifecycle. Moreover, our two-phase abstract interpretation approach does not require RASP developers to reimplement the enforcement code for static analysis."

The distribution of full-sibs obtainedamong the sampling sites was used to estimate individual dispersal distances within families. Our results showed that T. polycolpus sibs tend to be aggregated within sites but not withinhost individuals. We detected important upstream-to-downstream dispersal events of T.polycolpusbetween sites (modal distance: 25.4 km; 95% CI [22.9, 27.7]), becoming scarcer as the geographic distance from their family core location increases. Such a dispersal pattern likely contributes to the strong isolation-by-distance observed at the river scale. We also detected some downstream-to-upstream dispersal events (modal distance: 2.6 km; 95% CI [2.2-23.3]) that likely result from movementsof infected hosts.Within each site, the dispersal of free-living infective larvae among hosts likely contributes to increasing genetic diversity on hosts, possibly fostering the evolutionary potential of T. polycolpus."

They didn't want to accept the return because it had been over a month, so I had to talk to a supervisor and then the store manager, so I probably can't take it back and it fits really good and matches my other appliances so I want to use it but I'm not sure how to properly secure it.    \n\nI purchased stick on grips to go under the legs since they're solid metal, but I don't know what to do to prevent the rocking. I was thinking that if I got a pretty thick foam wedge that expanded then I could stick it in the back of the cabinet with the thickest side towards the back, and then slide the oven in and as the foam expanded it would push down slightly on the oven and prevent it from rocking much. This seems like it might not be secure enough though, so another thought I had was if I drill two small holes in the top of the cabinet (over each of the back corners of the oven where the hanging screws are supposed to go) then I could put a machine screw bolt (a machine screw without a head) in each of these holes and screw it in and then thread some type of special nut on until it meets the top of the cabinet so these bolts would hold it in place.     \n\nhttp://www.frigidaire.com/products/Kitchen/Microwaves/FGMV154CLF.aspx\ndavey_darling: Your electrician friend was right, and the appliance guy was feeding you a line of bs (or he just didn't know what he was talking about)\n\nThat said there likely isn't great danger in operating the unit this way.\n\nIf the cabinet it is mounted in has a top you could consider mounting it as it was intended - hanging from the top of the cabinet.\nYeah_anuses: Yeah, you got swindled. If it mounts like most over the range microwaves I've seen, your best bet is to screw it into the cabinet from the top.\n\nSince it sounds like you won't have much space to work with, you can't install it properly by using the bracket that attaches it to the wall. For best support you'll want to put some sort of spacer underneath it to elevate it to the right height.\n\nI've seen people put it in like this before. Not the most elegant solution but if you're handy enough to create a facade to cover the gap it shouldn't look too bad. The only bad news is you'll have some goofiness in the shelf above the micro, since your power cord and some screws will be there.\nmemento22mori: The bracket wont quite fit properly, if I did use it then it'd end up being too far back in the cabinet by a few inches so it'd look strange. It appears that I can mount it to the top of the cabinet, but there would be about 2.5\" of space below it that would be right at eye-level and would collect dust.\n"

As you already extend One Leg it creates the illusion that you are really close the to full progression even though that is actually not the case. Usually, when someone is talking about the One Leg Progression they mean that you extend the other leg just like in an Advance Tuck Position, which on the other hand is actually really hard and much closer to the full progression. The reason for that if I am not wrong is that when you tuck one leg in you are actually rounding your back just like in the normal tuck variation and hence create an overall shorter lever and making the exercise easier. That and the fact the the exercise gets obviously harder as you keep on extending the other leg. I am not sure on which progression you currently are but you might as well try both next time and see the difference for yourself. Also, my reply might appear a little harsh, which is why I want to assure that this isn\u2018t supposed to be the case. Just want to clarify why the One Leg progression is actually that hard. :D\n[deleted]: I can do a full planche\n\nBut yes i know what you mean, straightening out the lower back does push the tucked leg out a bit thus making it harder but still easier than a straddle \n\nIll try and film some progressions for you tomorrow\n\nEdit: i didnt take it as harsh, i understand what you mean\n"

It is proved that the radiation condition is indeed satisfied uniformly in $\\eps$, provided the refraction index satisfies a specific {\\em non-refocusing condition}, a condition that is first pointed out in this reference. The non-refocusing condition requires, in essence, that the rays of geometric optics naturally associated with the high-frequency Helmholtz operator, and that are sent from the origin $x=0$ at time $t=0$, should not refocus at some later time $t>0$ near the origin again. In the present text we show the {\\em optimality} of the above mentionned non-refocusing condition, in the following sense. We exhibit a refraction index which {\\em does} refocus the rays of geometric optics sent from the origin near the origin again, and, on the other hand, we completely compute the asymptotic behaviour of the solution to the associated Helmholtz equation: we show that the limiting solution {\\em does not} satisfy the natural radiation condition at infinity. More precisely, we show that the limiting solution is a {\\em perturbation} of the outgoing solution to the natural limiting Helmholtz equation, and that the perturbing term explicitly involves the contribution of the rays radiated from the origin which go back to the origin. This term is also conveniently modulated by a phase factor, which turns out to be the action along the above rays of the hamiltonian associated with the semiclassical Helmholtz equation."

We construct spin-bag operators which describe the holes dressed by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and find that elementary electronic excitations of the system can be described well in terms of weakly-interacting spin-1/2 Fermionic quasiparticles corresponding to the doped holes. We make a comparison with other numerical calculations and recent angle-resolved photoemission experiment and argue that, adopting this rather conventional Fermi-liquid scenario with non-Luttinger Fermi surface, one would explain many quasiparticle-relating properties of doped cuprates in a very simple and natural way. We also show that the dynamical spin and charge excitations deviate from the particle-hole excitations of this Fermi liquid: e.g., the dominant low-energy spin excitation at momentum transfer $(\\pi,\\pi)$ reflects excitations of the incoherent spin background and is identified as a collective mode comparable to spin waves in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet."

We show that the number of firms in each sector depends on the aggregate financial capital invested in the sector and its firms' expected long-term returns. Capital accumulation in each sector depends both on short-term returns and expected long-term returns relative to neighbouring sectors.For each sector, three patterns of accumulation emerge. In the first pattern, the dividend component of short-term returns is determinant for sectors with small number of firms and low capital. In the second pattern, both short and long-term returns in the sector drive intermediate-to-high capital. In the third pattern, higher expectations of long-term returns drive massive inputs of capital.Instability in capital accumulation may arise among and within sectors. We therefore widen our approach and study the dynamics of the collective configurations, in particular interactions between average capital and expected long-term returns, and show that overall stability crucially depends on the expectations' formation process.Expectations that are highly reactive to capital variations stabilize high capital configurations, and drive low-to-moderate capital sectors towards zero or a higher level of capital, depending on their initial capital. Inversely, low-to moderate capital configurations are stabilized by expectations moderately reactive to capital variations, and drive high capital sectors towards more moderate level of capital equilibria.Eventually, the combination of expectations both highly sensitive to exogenous conditions and highly reactive to variations in capital imply that large fluctuations of capital in the system, at the possible expense of the real economy."

Some, if not all, states legally require x amount of training hours per year to be a police officer. They also go to training and get certifications in all kinds of things before they join any kind of special teams like mobile field force (aka riot squad)\nI_AM_HYLIAN: The media has been bashing police offices all together. It's not a good time to be a white cop at the moment. They are well equipped, but ill trained with the weapons at hand. I know people in the force. My buddy has probably shot a rifle once while in his uniform since he was sworn in. Going on 6 years he's never fired a grenade launcher, nor a rifle. Military men and women deal with those sorts of weapons day in and day out. They are properly trained. Cops may be given a certificate stating that they are trained to shoot a rifle, but do they put it in to practice everyday? I'm sorry but they don't. \nSquirrel009: Just because your friend doesn't practice with his rifle that means all officers are inadequately trained? \nI_AM_HYLIAN: True, but he's been in the force long enough to know not everyone doest because like you said it's not common practice. \n"

I mean, I could easily complete week 3 (in my last pullup workout I did 9-9-8-8-7-5), but to complete week 4, I would have to stop by 8th-9th rep, rest 20-30 seconds and force those 2-4 reps more, and as far as I understand, the goal is to do all sets without letting the bar go.\n\nSo maybe it's a trust issue, of it's really worth it. I mean, I don't want to waste my time. From the other hand, doing what I thought was right, wasn't really the best option either. \n\nWhat do you think, is this doable, reasonable program that have a chance to work and really progress me somewhat closer to 20 clean reps in a row, although it starts so easy? And the question from the beginning: do I just repeat a workout untill I complete given numbers, if I fail to do it on a first attempt?\n\nAnd maybe it makes sense to modify it; start from week 3, repeat it twice and then try to go further?\n\nAnd another very important question: will it be a good idea to do 2 or 3 sets of inverted rows after pullups, just to get more volume, or should I focus on those pullups exclusively? But it seems so little, for last months I've been doing 3 sets of weighted chins, followed by 3 sets of myo reps inverted rows, every two or three days... But than again, it didn't work that great.\n\nSorry, I'm just confused, trying to work my way out of beginner stage. Any advice will be appreciated.\n\nAlso: do you think does it makes sense to apply this program to weighted dips, heavy enough to fail before 10 reps?\ncmxguru: Have you considered using a pull-up assist band to get you through those extended reps?  A light band might allow you to get in 1-3 more reps after you fail.\nmt5z: Do you mean that if I fail to do 12 reps in week 4, I should hop on band to do the number? Well, what's the point, I'm supposed to get stronger at BW pullups here. After 20 seconds I'm ready to complete the set anyway.\ncmxguru: Then wait/rest. But pullups are the sorta exercise you can completely gas out on and find sets 2 and 3 of 12 reps very hard to complete even with a rest. Throw say a 20lb assist band on there after failure and it will still be incredibly hard but it could make set 3 completable.\n"

Hundreds if not thousands of mine shafts all over under ground to conveniently *hide* half of the process and take up far less room, and room is always far more a problem than cost or ability.\nNewSauerKraus: The water has to go somewhere after it drops.\nKayakingtheredriver: https://www.adv-geosci.net/45/45/2018/adgeo-45-45-2018-avatar-web.png\n\nThat is what all the tunnels in the mine are for. The shaft is the drop to turn the turbines, the miles of tunnels at the bottom of the shaft are the storage. A mine is far, far more than the shaft. Run pipes down the shaft to the end of the mine tunnels with topside pumps to bring the water back up.\nNewSauerKraus: So your solution is to pump water up while energy is cheap, and let it flow down at night?\nKayakingtheredriver: Yep, or just *use* on site wind or solar stations to run the pumps during the day converting it into energy that is more valuable when there isn't sun and less wind at night. It is efficient, and renewable and the costs to maintain/build are far lessened because old mines have done most of the excavation for you and can be had dirt cheap, compared to building a dam and 2 reservoirs.\nNewSauerKraus: It\u2019s much cheaper, easier, and cleaner to just use a damn instead of a mine.\nKayakingtheredriver: Lol, dams are *so* easy and cheap to build huh? I will concede this water would become caustic with all the mixed in coal dust over time, but cost and and ease of build (from all the environment impact studies, what effect it will have on the river, displacement, and on and on) are far in the mine shafts favor. The mine only needs a above ground reservoir. It doesn't need an upstream or down stream river, a downstream reservoir, or displacement of land owners up/down stream or the years necessary to build all of that plus the dam. Just an upstream tank, the piped turbines (that you have to build either way) and the pump station (that you would have to build either way). None of the rest. It would cost way less in time and money.\nDannyBlind: I disagree, check my other comment. Coal dust is way more dangerous than you'd think\n"

Before you put the hardwood down make sure everything is secure and no squeaks exist BEFORE the flooring goes down. Hard to repair later. If you need anything at all please pm me. I would love to help. I have literally 3/4 of a million feet experience and have done homes that were 40 million dollars. I want the proper info out there.

Everyone says it's a fake thing but having your wood there for 5 days with the ends open is the best way to save your investment\nGlamRockDave: you ain't kidding.  The idiots who remodeled my house before I bought it did a rush cut and run job (developer was in a rush to keep his head above water during the 2008 crash, he's in jail now, but that's a long story), didn't acclimate the wood, and then didn't even leave a gap.   It's a super old house and they knew removing the old baseboards in the hallway would damage the plaster wall with 500 layers of paint on them.  So they lucked out and the boards came up right to each edge in that hallway so they just laid it down right up to each ancient baseboard.  Didn't even nail some of them down (or at least sparsely).  I've redone most of the house but haven't gotten around to that hallway since the wood itself is reasonably good shape, but I can see it bulge in spots and it gets worse seasonally.\n\nNot a fake thing.\n"

Furthermore, if I did manage to get lucky, I am afraid of being shamed or laughed at the second the girl knew that I have no fucking clue of what im doing. \n\nI told one of my other friends about my insecurity with starting to have sex and he kept telling me to watch videos of how to eat a girl out and that I should just go for it. But even then, I dont feel comfortable because how the fuck am I supposed to feel confident without proper practice?\n\nI want to make sure that I can trust the woman I am with that she wont shame me or feel like she is doing me a favor by having sex with me. I want her to be excited about it and be happy to teach me the ropes. I don't want to have sex with someone that I feel might shame me and I don't think that im gonna find that person in a single night.  I now feel nervous as hell to go to this party because it feels like he is making the goal of the party the sex and now I feel like if I refuse to have sex or that if I do and fail, that he will look down on me. I've never been in a situation like this or had a friend like him before in my life. How can I take the pressure off myself?\nDisjoint_Set: I don't understand how his wanting to have sex puts pressure on you. All you have to do is not interfere with his pursuits, and maybe keep a woman or two engaged in conversation while he tries to seduce someone. You could be the guy that tells people it's his birthday, that plays better than him announcing it to women himself.\nHaunting-Leading-652: Makes sense. The issue is that I consistently feel like I have to prove myself to him. And I feel like he might have high expectations for me and Im afraid of falling short of them. I never felt like I had to prove to myself to a specific person before but ever since I saw just how good this guy is with women and how I pale in comparison, I felt like I always have to prove to him that I am just as much a man than he is. I am not even 100% sure he secretly thinks less of me(this could all very well just be in my head), but even then I can't stop fearing that he might.\n\nIn my head it was as if he was saying: \"Theres gonna be a lot of hot girls here, this is what im gonna do and what I expect all single guys to do\".\n\nEdit: Just thought about this. I think the fact that he constantly mentions that there are gonna be a ton of \"culitos\"(little asses in Spanish, which basically means, hot chicks), combined with the fact that he says that he is gonna fuck means that he might be expecting me to do the same because why else would you say that there gonna be a lot of \"culitos\"? Get me?\nElegantEntropy: You don't owe anything to any one, unless you actually borrowed or promised them something. \n\nTell him to have fun and that you will be there for the party.

But also... Were you scooter bound...? I know for some it's very easy to just pull themselves up and put their nose to the grindstone to lose weight. I had a year where I went from 260 to 200 (at 5'11) in about 5 months when I was running/walking 5 miles every day and had changed my eating habits.

Congratulations. Keep going. Once the water weight comes off then the real fun begins.\nOnlySeesLastSentence: I might be wrong since I'm not a nutritionist, but I want to say it's probably not water weight because I've been drinking mostly (unsweetened) tea as my drink of choice.  It used to be one or two monsters a day.  Then upgraded to soda and Gatorade.  Then to just Arizona, until I found out it was sugary af.\n\nMy actual food intake is (slightly) lower too.  But yeah, considering I used to be at 160lbs three years ago, I can tell i can get there again, but that it'll probably take a year of tough dieting to get there without killing myself lol.  But that said, I know I have to over eat like crazy to become 250lbs.

These methods are based on a variety of inconsistent but judicious ensemble auxiliary transformations or include additional inflation/localisationtype algorithmic innovations, in order to avoid the inherent time-degeneracy of an insufficient particle ensemble size when solving a filtering problem with an unstable signal. To the best of our knowledge, the first and the only rigorous mathematical analysis of these sophisticated discrete generation particle filters is developed in the pioneering articles by Le Gland-Monbet-Tran and by Mandel-Cobb-Beezley, which were published in the early 2010s. Nevertheless, besides the fact that these studies prove the asymptotic consistency of the Ensemble Kalman filter, they provide exceedingly pessimistic meanerror estimates that grow exponentially fast with respect to the time horizon, even for linear Gaussian filtering problems with stable one dimensional signals. In the present article we develop a novel self-contained and complete stochastic perturbation analysis of the fluctuations, the stability, and the long-time performance of these discrete generation ensemble Kalman particle filters, including time-uniform and non-asymptotic mean-error estimates that apply to possibly unstable signals. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this type in the literature on discrete generation particle filters, including the class of genetic-type particle filters and discrete generation ensemble Kalman filters. The stochastic Riccati difference equations considered in this work are also of interest in their own right, as a prototype of a new class of stochastic rational difference equation."

The traditional dynamic model can be used to calculate the load on each joint. However, due to the activation of the muscle, this situation only causes part of the load transmitted to the joint, and the work of the chair will compensate the other part of the load. Analysis at the muscle level allows a better understanding of the impact of crutches on the body. By comparing the levels of activation of the trunk muscles, it was found that the use of crutches for walking, especially a single crutch, can cause a large difference in the activation of the back muscles on the left and right sides, and this difference will cause muscle degeneration for a long time, leading to scoliosis. In this article taking scoliosis as an example, by analyzing the muscles around the spine, we can better understand the pathology and can better prevent diseases. The objective of this article is to analyze normal walking compared to walking with one or two crutches using OpenSim software to obtain the degree of activation of different muscles in order to analyze the impact of crutches on the body."

I thought it might be a flexibility issue, but I've developed decent flexibility in my ankles at this point. Then I thought balance, so I added 8lbs in front of me and was able to perform my reps perfectly. \n\n\nShould I continue to use the weight as I go lower and lower until it's just the floor, or should I continue using the weight until I can do then without it at my current box height, then go down and repeat?\n\n\n**2.** I'm doing the startbodyweight routine, and one of the issues I've seen is that it is imbalanced with 3 pushes and 2 pulls. I haven't noticed any issues in this regard. I do BJJ and there is a lot of pulling involved. Could this potentially balance out the push-pull? Is there another pull I can add to balance things? Should I add extra sets of my pulls?\ncuriouscalisthenist: 1. Use minimal weight, get full ROM, then reduce weights. Or try doing assisted pistols, holding to some pole or pushing off of a bench.\n\n2. Keep 1 for each vert/hori push/pull. Doing 3 push/pull would just be too much, unless you're an intermediate or advanced.\neman_resu_tluafed: I'm not new to this. I've only been doing BWF for 6 months, but I've been in pretty good shape for the last 6 years since I started BJJ. I don't feel like an extra pull would be too much, I just want to balance things out a bit, but I don't know what to add. \ncuriouscalisthenist: Acc to me, 6 months in bwf isn't exactly more than a beginner, though I understand you must be in great shape since you do BJJ. If you still want to add something, I guess you'd be fine with adding another set or two of a different variation of pull ups I suppose. Or, work on L/V/Manna progressions, they work almost the same muscles as pulling afaik.\neman_resu_tluafed: Beginner to BWF, sure, but not to fitness. Not sure what L/V/Manna is. \ncuriouscalisthenist: L sit, V sit, Manna. Progressions.\neman_resu_tluafed: Working with L-sit. Not a fan, honestly. \n\nLooked up the manna. Didn't even know that was a thing. \ncuriouscalisthenist: L sits take a long time if you don't have the scapular strength or the hip flexor strength or the hamstring flexibility or a combination of them or all of them or many more factors. I suggested it because it uses the same muscles as pulling afaik, so, in the end, you'd be having a different exercise for the addition you seek.\n\nYea, I accept, they're hard.\neman_resu_tluafed: Thanks.

The next day, Krafchenko, armed with a Luger, confronted Porter in his office. Porter was able to distract Krafchenko and pull out his own gun. He then made Krafchenko drop his weapon and leave the office.\nIn 1916, Porter left the Telegram to start his own news service. He also worked as a freelance reporter for various newspapers, including the Vancouver Daily Province, Montreal Star and Toronto Evening Telegram. In 1920, when the Telegram merged with the rival Winnipeg Tribune, Porter began working for the Tribune.\nLater in life, he continued to write a column for the Saturday Tribune called \"The Old-Timer Talks\" and also wrote crime stories for detective magazines. Porter died in his sleep at home in Winnipeg at the age of 78."

For the rolling $(NS)$, the reachable set (from any point) can be described exactly in terms of the holonomy groups of $(M,g)$ and $(\\hM,\\hg)$ respectively, and thus we achieve a complete understanding of the controllability properties of the corresponding control system. As for the rolling $(R)$, the problem turns out to be more delicate. We first provide basic global properties for the reachable set and investigate the associated Lie bracket structure. In particular, we point out the role played by a curvature tensor defined on the state space, that we call the \\emph{rolling curvature}. In the case where one of the manifolds is a space form (let say $(\\hM,\\hg)$), we show that it is enough to roll along loops of $(M,g)$ and the resulting orbits carry a structure of principal bundle which preserves the rolling $(R)$ distribution. In the zero curvature case, we deduce that the rolling $(R)$ is completely controllable if and only if the holonomy group of $(M,g)$ is equal to SO(n). In the nonzero curvature case, we prove that the structure group of the principal bundle can be realized as the holonomy group of a connection on $TM\\oplus \\R$, that we call the rolling connection. We also show, in the case of positive (constant) curvature, that if the rolling connection is reducible, then $(M,g)$ admits, as Riemannian covering, the unit sphere with the metric induced from the Euclidean metric of $\\R^{n+1}$. When the two manifolds are three-dimensional, we provide a complete local characterization of the reachable sets when the two manifolds are three-dimensional and, in particular, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a non open orbit. Besides the trivial case where the manifolds $(M,g)$ and $(\\hM,\\hg)$ are (locally) isometric, we show that (local) non controllability occurs if and only if $(M,g)$ and $(\\hM,\\hg)$ are either warped products or contact manifolds with additional restrictions that we precisely describe. Finally, we extend the two types of rolling to the case where the manifolds have different dimensions."

To address the need for knowledge organization in this domain, this paper implements the first systematic meta-survey of general surveys and reviews on outlier and anomaly detection. Employing a classical systematic survey approach, the study collects nearly 500 papers using two specialized scientific search engines. From this comprehensive collection, a subset of 56 papers that claim to be general surveys on outlier detection is selected using a snowball search technique to enhance field coverage. A meticulous quality assessment phase further refines the selection to a subset of 25 high-quality general surveys. Using this curated collection, the paper investigates the evolution of the outlier detection field over a 20-year period, revealing emerging themes and methods. Furthermore, an analysis of the surveys sheds light on the survey writing practices adopted by scholars from different communities who have contributed to this field. Finally, the paper delves into several topics where consensus has emerged from the literature. These include taxonomies of outlier types, challenges posed by high-dimensional data, the importance of anomaly scores, the impact of learning conditions, difficulties in benchmarking, and the significance of neural networks. Non-consensual aspects are also discussed, particularly the distinction between local and global outliers and the challenges in organizing detection methods into meaningful taxonomies."

The schedules must also be seen to be fair, in that unpopular shifts have to be spread evenly amongst all nurses, and other restrictions, such as team nursing and special conditions for senior staff, have to be satisfied. The basis of the family of genetic algorithms is a classical genetic algorithm consisting of n-point crossover, single-bit mutation and a rank-based selection. The solution space consists of all schedules in which each nurse works the required number of shifts, but the remaining constraints, both hard and soft, are relaxed and penalised in the fitness function. The talk will start with a detailed description of the problem and the initial implementation and will go on to highlight the shortcomings of such an approach, in terms of the key element of balancing feasibility, i.e. covering the demand and work regulations, and quality, as measured by the nurses' preferences. A series of experiments involving parameter adaptation, niching, intelligent weights, delta coding, local hill climbing, migration and special selection rules will then be outlined and it will be shown how a series of these enhancements were able to eradicate these difficulties. Results based on several months' real data will be used to measure the impact of each modification, and to show that the final algorithm is able to compete with a tabu search approach currently employed at the hospital. The talk will conclude with some observations as to the overall quality of this approach to this and similar problems."

It's not good, and many farmers would like to see more competition amongst seed providers. However, the article fails to mention that increased seed prices are accompanied by greatly decreased costs of raising the patented crops, potentially resulting in overall savings. A huge amount of seeds are patented, and there's a rational reason why so many farmers are deciding to purchase them.\n\nAnd back to the case--there's the whole fact that Mr. Bowman said that he knew the seeds he bought probably contained patented seeds. And that he is very familiar with the clauses in Monsanto's contracts that prohibits planting those seeds. His whole defense boils down to, \"I didn't think they would care that much,\" and then acts surprised when Monsanto does, in fact, care.\nBigSlowTarget: &gt;His whole defense boils down to, \"I didn't think they would care that much,\" and then acts surprised when Monsanto does, in fact, care.\n\nI have to disagree here. The issue is not whether or not Monsanto cares but if Monsanto has the right to dictate uses of the seeds throughout the supply chain. The consequence is significant - If it does then you are running the risk of breaking the law should you ever decide to plant something you buy at the grocery store or for that matter obtain from any source anywhere. \n\nThis is a self replicating technology and does not require any other technology to replicate. At the point of sale there were no contracts signed to limit it's use. The product is deliberately mixed in and made indistinguishable with non-patented items to increase marketability. Each of those are significant facts. It seems to me there is much more than Monsanto didn't care going on here.\n[deleted]: I agree with you, and thanks for the response--his legal defense certainly entails more than just \"I thought they wouldn't care\". It seems like I was speaking more to his justification. Mr. Bowman has said that he was well aware of Monsanto's control over the seeds, he knew he couldn't plant Monsanto seeds without infringing, that the seeds that he bought probably contained Monsanto seeds, and that he didn't think they'd care since the affect on their market would be minimal. Basically, he knew he was probably infringing, but did it anyways.\n\nOf course, his legal defense will incorporate sophisticated doctrinal arguments. There are huge consequences in terms of setting a precedent for patent exhaustion as it applies to self-replicating technologies, and also for the mixing/labeling issues. It gets more pressing when we consider that patent infringement is a strict liability tort, so lack of knowledge is not a defense.\n\nThat being said, if a precedent is set on self-replicating technologies, I really hope it's not influenced by Mr. Bowman's knowledge (or willful blindness) that he was infringing.\n"

I understand if you're the type of person that doesn't like to touch raw ingredients. If that's the case go the slower route. But if you dont mind touching raw ingredients, then the garlic thing gives you absolutely no benefits.\nFlRELYNX: You shouldn\u2019t use the hand method if you need to use the egg whites for baking, like in merengue, as you can\u2019t have any fat contents in your bowl when mixing them. Your hands contain natural oils acting just like fat. Also I don\u2019t get how it would take any longer than sifting it by hand. It takes me about 5 seconds to use the shell method and I don\u2019t waste as much egg whites. A lot of the egg white liquid will stick to my hands but it doesn\u2019t stick to the insides of the shells, as they\u2018re coated in that wet membrane.\nharriettbakes: Sorry, that is not correct. I am a baker and use the hand method as much as possible. I can get much more of the egg white separated from the yolk using my hands vs. any other method, and the resultant egg whites never fail to whip up fluffy and light. \n\nThe egg shell method is more likely to stab the yolk as you are separating. Yolk in the egg whites is what limits successful whipping. Maybe your hands weren\u2019t entirely clean from a different step and there were oils left over on your hand.\nFlRELYNX: I never touch any raw ingredients when whipping up whites and I always clean my bowls with vinegar, if I need to. I also always wash my hands with soap after each step. I\u2019ve learned this trick from a SORTEDfood video and in my experience, it has proven to be true. The yolk shouldn\u2019t be stabbed by the shells if you do it correctly (do not shove one shell into the other but rather hold them slightly under each other). It\u2018s important that you break them correctly though, so that the shells don\u2019t crack too much. That\u2019s a matter of practice - of course this will be the same with all methods. I have never had any shells in my dough/ merengue etc. but I\u2018ve had problems with them not whipping correctly, which I didn\u2019t have after switching to this method. So maybe you were just lucky with your merengue or because of your experience in handling the whipping. My mother doesn\u2019t clean her bowls as thoroughly as I do (she doesn\u2019t really like baking because of the effort) and she doesn\u2019t really bother separating them correctly (i.e. once she accidentally had a tiny bit of yolk in there) but she still always manages to whip her whites up beautifully. So I guess it also depends on the quality of your eggs and on your whipping method. Nevertheless, the science says any oils in your whites will make it harder to whip them! And I\u2018m not really good at whipping, so I definitely prefer my method, just to be safe.\nharriettbakes: Wow, more power to you! To each his own. Happy whipping.\nFlRELYNX: Thanks, happy whipping to you, too!\n"

Moreover, the optical flux cannot lag behind the UV by more than 6 days. These results cannot be accommodated in the framework of the standard geometrically thin accretion disk model. Rather, they suggest that the bulk of the UV and optical flux originates from thermal reprocessing of X-rays irradiating the disk. The soft X-ray excess is probably the only spectral component which originates from viscous dissipation inside the disk and the near infrared is probably emitted by hot dust heated by the UV radiation. Such a model is consistent with NGC~4593 having a relatively small black-hole mass of the order of $2\\times10^{6}{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ as inferred from the line variability study. The high ionization/excitation emission lines are very broad and strongly variable and their variations correlate with those of the continuum. The low excitation lines are significantly narrower and remain constant within the accuracy of our measurements. These results suggest a stratified BLR, where the degree of ionization and the velocity dispersion of the gas increase toward small radii. The \\lya\\ line responds to the variations of the continuum with a delay $\\leq 4$ days.

It is not known if preconditioning has to be applied to the donor, the recipient, or both. No drug/target pair has been envisioned and validated in the clinic.

Although the \"Murrayite theory\" proved popular among sectors of academia and the general public in the early and mid-twentieth century, it was never accepted by specialists in the witch trials, who publicly disproved it through in-depth research during the 1960s and 1970s.\nContemporary experts in European witchcraft beliefs view the 'pagan witch cult' theory as pseudohistorical. There is now an academic consensus that those accused and executed as witches were not followers of any witch religion, pagan or otherwise. Critics highlight several flaws with the theory. It rested on highly selective use of evidence from the trials, thereby heavily misrepresenting the events and the actions of both the accused and their accusers. It also mistakenly assumed that claims made by accused witches were truthful, and not distorted by coercion and torture. Further, despite claims the 'witch cult' was a pre-Christian survival, there is no evidence of such a 'pagan witch cult' throughout the Middle Ages.\nThe witch-cult hypothesis has influenced literature, being adapted into fiction in works by John Buchan, Robert Graves, and others. It greatly influenced Wicca, a new religious movement of modern Paganism that emerged in mid-twentieth-century Britain and claimed to be a survival of the 'pagan witch cult'. Since the 1960s, Carlo Ginzburg and other scholars have argued that surviving elements of pre-Christian religion in European folk culture influenced Early Modern stereotypes of witchcraft, but scholars still debate how this may relate, if at all, to the Murrayite witch-cult hypothesis."

Combating that comes down a lot to the way the structural foundations are designed and built. If it's projected that in the future, say 10 years from now, the ground won't be stable enough to hold the building due to its location or soil conditions, they would likely tell the architect the site is bad and the architect would then tell the client this before an agreement is signed. It's the architects job to know a little about everything but not neccesarily deep knowledge about certain topics, that's what he/she has their team for. \n\nI have not done much research into tsunami proofing and it hasn't come up in class yet. The emphasis right now is on mitigating damage due to tectonic movement (earthquakes) and wind forces. If a building is bound to fall down anyway, we need to make sure it falls down in a way that hurts as few people as possible. California building code has no provisions that give any requirements for a building to be resistant to tsunamis. However, if a building were to be designed to resistant to tsunamis it would want to be oriented and formed in such a way that they water could flow past it easily and exert as little force as possible on it. It's like trying to push a cruise ship sideways through water, it's not going to work. That's why the ships are built narrow so the water can go around them.  \n\nHope I answered your question!\nLocalGae: Yes! Thank you so much for your time!\n"

In this case, there is somehow a \\textit{regularisation} by turbulence (corresponding to the Reynolds number going to $+ \\infty$); the \\textit{vanishing viscosity} overwhelms the potential blowing up of the rough coefficients. Importantly, as a by-product of our analysis, we are able to give a meaning of a product of distributions. For $b$ lying in a $C^\\gamma$, we obtain the same condition as for the usual Bony's para-product; but in a weaker solution framework, the product is defined beyond the para-product condition and even with no constraint at all in the \\textit{mild vanishing viscous} context. We also obtain that the time averaging of the distributions product is $\\gamma$-H\\\"older continuous. These new results happens because, in the considered product, one of the distribution is the gradient of a solution of a Partial Differential Equation. Thanks to our analysis, we also get a H\\\"older control of a solution of the inviscid Burgers' equation. Under some regularity and vanishing viscous constraint, the solution is a weak solution and is unique in a certain sense. The vanishing viscous procedure allows to avoid the well-known critical time of the solution built by characteristics."

This work on Teichm\\\"uller space led him to recast the bases of analytic geometry using the language of categories and functors. In Grothendieck's words, the Teichm\\\"uller curve becomes a space representing a functor from the category of analytic spaces into the category of sets. In this survey, we comment on Grothendieck's series of lectures. The survey is primarily addressed to low-dimensional topologists and geometers. In presenting Grothendieck's results, we tried to explain or rephrase in more simple terms some notions that are usually expressed in the language of algebraic geometry. However, it is not possible to short-circuit the language of categories and functors. The survey is also addressed to those algebraic geometers who wish to know how the notion of moduli space evolved in connection with Teichm\\\"uller theory. Explaining the origins of mathematical ideas contributes in dispensing justice to their authors and it usually renders the theory that is surveyed more attractive. The final version of this paper will appear as a chapter in Volume VI of the Handbook of Teichm\\\"uller theory. This volume is dedicated to the memory of Alexander Grothendieck."

There was also in the preceeding 60 years a series of movements mostly by displaced and persecuted Jews to the Palestinian region. Prior to the creation of Isreal, Palestine was under control of the British, not the US or even themselves, and the creation of Israel was timed to be at the end of British rule. There was also the issue of what to do with all the displaced Jews all around the world, where would be the safe place for them to live, and that was something that was talked about within the League of Nations prior to the creation of Israel.\n\nFor your question, you might want to put it into a specific context. Are you wondering whether it moral right now to continue, or was it moral to create it in the first place? You could get answers far ranging, from comparisons to why it is OK for the US to still occupy Native American land or not, to the idea that the League of Nations was just doing its best under the circumstances, and what they hoped was best for all people involved.\nmanolo458: Appreciate the comparison that you made with US occupying Native American land.

I personally don't like the US carte blanche approach with Isreal, and I'm also not a fan of the general view by the current Palestinian government (Hamas) that all the Jews should be wiped into the sea. I can see why the Israelis have a hard time negotiating with them, however their approach of trying to build cities and slowly take over Palestinian claimed land (1967 boarders) by having entrenched populations while specifically not negotiating is a really dick move, and only enrages a people who are slowly getting squeezed.\n\nIn the immortal words of Rodney King, \"Can't we all just get along?\"\n\nedit: see, just like talking about it, even though i've gone on my own tangent only partially related to your question :)\n"

The evaluation shows that our approach is expressive and flexible enough to support record & replay of applications using threads & locks, communicating event loops, communicating sequential processes, software transactional memory and combinations of those concurrency models. For the actor model, we reach recording performance competitive with an optimized special-purpose record & replay solution. The average recording overhead on the Savina actor benchmark suite is 10% (min. 0%, max. 23%). The performance for other concurrency models and combinations thereof is at a similar level. We believe our concurrency-model-agnostic approach helps developers of applications that mix and match concurrency models. We hope that this substrate inspires new tools and languages making building and maintaining of multi-paradigm concurrent applications simpler and safer."

APPROACH: We present a framework for modular data access, in which individual data accessors for simple data structures may be freely combined to obtain more complex data accessors for compound data structures. Data accessors become first-class citizens. The framework is based around the notion of profunctors, a flexible generalization of functions. KNOWLEDGE: The language features required are higher-order functions (\"lambdas\" or \"closures\"), parametrized types (\"generics\" or \"abstract types\"), and some mechanism for separating interfaces from implementations (\"abstract classes\" or \"modules\"). We use Haskell as a vehicle in which to present our constructions, but languages such as Java, C#, or Scala that provide the necessary features should work just as well. GROUNDING: We provide implementations of all our constructions, in the form of a literate program: the manuscript file for the paper is also the source code for the program, and the extracted code is available separately for evaluation. We also prove the essential properties demonstrating that our profunctor-based representations are precisely equivalent to the more familiar concrete representations.

This allows us to make progress on the semitoric minimal model program by understanding and coming up with explicit systems for each strictly minimal type (i.e. those not admitting any toric or semitoric type blowdown). In order to obtain these systems, we develop strategies for constructing and understanding explicit examples of semitoric (and hypersemitoric) systems in general. One strategy we make use of is to start from a well-understood system (such as a toric system) and to explicitly induce Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcations to produce focus-focus singular points. This is an expanded version of the technique used in the aforementioned previous paper, in order to apply it to semitoric systems which include non-trivial isotropy spheres in the underlying $S^1$-space (i.e. $\\mathbb{Z}_k$-spheres), which occurs in several of the strictly minimal systems. In particular, we give an explicit one-parameter family of systems on $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ which transitions between being of toric type, semitoric type, and hypersemitoric type depending on the value of the parameter. We study this system at each stage, computing the marked semitoric polygon of the semitoric system and determining several properties of the hypersemitoric system, including the existence of a unique flap and two parabolic orbits. Furthermore, we study the transitions between these stages. We also come up with new explicit semitoric systems on all Hirzebruch surfaces which, together with the previous systems and the systems already contained in the literature, gives an explicit model for every type of strictly minimal system. Moreover, we show how to obtain every strictly minimal system by applying sequences of alternating toric type blowups and blowdowns to simple explicit systems. In particular, we obtain that every strictly minimal semitoric system is part of a family $(M,\\omega,F_t=(J,H_t))$ which is semitoric for all but a finite number of values of $t$, called a semitoric family."

The relative importance of types of soil increases with time. In the area of settlements, the transition from forest to pasture and family crops occurred preferentially on the variegated clay. However, it is possible that the prevalence of this transition on this texture has been given due more to the history of occupation of this area. Historically the sandy valleys were the first to be occupied, and the continuity of the deforestation occurred toward the slopes dominated by variegated clay and plateaus with Belterra clay.

We prove that in eventual synchronous systems a modified version of Tendermint solves (i) under additional assumptions, a variant of one-shot consensus for the validation of one single block and (ii) a variant of the repeated consensus problem for multiple blocks. These results hold even if the set of validators is hit by Byzantine failures, provided that for each one-shot consensus instance less than one third of the validators is Byzantine. Our second contribution relates to the fairness of the rewarding mechanism. It is common knowledge that in permisionless blockchain systems the main threat is the tragedy of commons that may yield the system to collapse if the rewarding mechanism is not adequate. Ad minimum the rewarding mechanism must be fair, i.e.distributing the rewards in proportion to the merit of participants. We prove, for the first time in blockchain systems, that in repeated-consensus based blockchains there exists an (eventual) fair rewarding mechanism if and only if the system is (eventual) synchronous. We also show that the original Tendermint rewarding is not fair, however, a modification of the original protocol makes it eventually fair."

        "text": " smells and design ideas, we designed and conducted an exploratory case study. While previous research presented a broad overview, we have chosen a narrow setting to reach for even deeper insights: The framework JHotDraw had been designed so thoughtfully that most smell warnings are expected to be false positives. Nevertheless, the \"Law of Good Style\", better known as the \"Law of Demeter\", is a rather restrictive design rule so that we still expected to find some potential bad smells, i.e. violations of this \"Law\". This combination led to 1215 potential smells of which at most 42 are true positives. We found generic as well as specific design ideas that were traded for the smell. Our confidence in that decision ranged from high enough to very high. We were surprised to realize that the smell definition itself required the formulation of constructive design ideas. Finally we found some smells to be the result of the limitation of the language and one could introduce auxiliary constructive design ideas to compensate for them. The decision whether a potential smell occurrence is actually a true positive was made very meticulously. For that purpose we took three qualities that the smell could affect negatively into account and we discussed the result of the recommended refactorings. If we were convinced that we had found a false positive, we described the relationships with design ideas. The realization that not only general design ideas but also specific design ideas have an influence on whether a potential smell is a true positive turns the problem of false positives from a scientific problem (\"What is the true definition of the smell?\") to a engineering problem (\"How can we incorporate design ideas into smell definitions?\"). We recommend to add adaptation points to the smell definitions. Higher layers may then adapt the smell for specific contexts. After adaptation the tool may continuously provide distinct and precise quality feedback, reducing the cognitive load for the developer and preventing habituation. Furthermore, the schema for the discussion of potential smells may be used to elaborate more sets of true and false smell occurrences. Finally, it follows that smell detection based on machine learning should also take signs of design ideas into account."

The challenge with the proposition are the possible loop holes. Want to retire early? Shoot someone who you can claim looked like was pulling a gun on you. Are you a gang who needs a cop of the street? Put then in a situation requiring force. Maybe the benefits would out weigh misuses, maybe not.\n\n2) Being more like the UK with possibly less gun related crime would be nice, but there's more than one personal firearm per American citizen in the US. To try reaching that ideal, a number of things would need to happen, such as people would need to be disarmed before you could think of disarming US cops. This also grows the arms black market. Bearing arms is a constitutional right, one that would not be given up without a civil war.\ncavehobbit: 1) so far as media reports, I can only say I have seen that kind of analysis posted on reddit,  on a phone now so find it is difficult. So far as retiring early, you get nothing if you are convicted of a crime, so that is incentive to be careful. I do not know how the UK handles vulnerability of their officers to attack, but it seems to work there.\n\n2) I do not think you would need to disarm the population for this to work.

We calculate the distribution of particles produced from the jet wake by using the Cooper-Frye prescription and find that both the transverse momentum spectrum and the distribution of particles in azimuthal angle are similar in shape in linearized hydrodynamics and in the hybrid model. Their normalizations are different because the momentum-rapidity distribution in the linearized hydrodynamics analysis is more spread out, due to sound modes. Since the Bjorken flow has no transverse expansion, we explore the effect of transverse flow by using local boosts to add it into the Cooper-Frye formula. After including the effects of transverse flow in this way, the transverse momentum spectrum becomes harder: more particles with transverse momenta bigger than $2$ GeV are produced than in the hybrid model. Although we defer implementing this analysis in a jet Monte Carlo, as would be needed to make quantitative comparisons to data, we gain a qualitative sense of how the jet wake may modify jet observables by computing proxies for two example observables: the lost energy recovered in a cone of varying open angle, and the fragmentation function. We find that linearized hydrodynamics with transverse flow effects added improves the description of the jet wake in the hybrid model in just the way that comparison to data indicates is needed. Our study illuminates a path to improving the description of the wake in the hybrid model, highlighting the need to take into account the effects of both transverse flow and the broadening of the energy-momentum perturbation in spacetime rapidity on particle production."

In 1997, the Smilodon skeleton from the First American site was the source for the logo of the Nashville Predators hockey team and the inspiration for their mascot, Gnash.\nIts name and logo disappeared in December 2000 when it was acquired by AmSouth Bancorporation, an institution based in Birmingham, Alabama, that was slightly smaller in size. First American had operated as a fully owned subsidiary of AmSouth for most of 2000. First American was sold after a series of unprofitable mergers, including one with Jackson, Mississippi-based Deposit Guaranty Bank that proved to be a hurdle the corporation could not clear financially. Deposit Guaranty was fully integrated into First American, but kept its name. This allowed FANB to gain significant market share in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana, though it did not operate these branches under the corporate brand, nor under recent the Iowa purchaser.\nFirst American's demise ended Nashville's storied history as a strong financial center. It, along with Third National Bank (now a part of SunTrust) and Commerce Union Bank (now a part of Bank of America), was once involved in a tight three-way battle for market share that ultimately helped all three banks expand well beyond their respective bounds. When the resources of the three could no longer stand the rapid expansion and numerous acquisitions, they all succumbed and merged with other banks. FANB, the largest of these three banks, was the only one to fold itself into a smaller institution. As of 2007, Nashville is still home to several local banks, but most do not exist outside of Davidson County.\nUntil 2005, AmSouth Bank continued First American's former tradition of having the highest market share in Nashville, however it was surpassed by SunTrust after its acquisition of Memphis-based National Commerce Financial. In 2006, however, AmSouth reclaimed the distinction of largest market share in metropolitan Nashville. In 2006-2007, AmSouth merged with Regions Financial Corporation which is headquartered in Birmingham.

I was told the first step would be to neuter him which would take care of the testosterone which would hopefully solve the prostate problems, if not more surgery would be needed. Thankfully neutering him solved his prostate issues. \n\nOnce a male dog has gone through puberty and had testosterone surging through his system neutering them really does very little to nothing to change their personality. The same for male cats, once they have the testosterone in their system you can't magically change their personality back to cute kitten-hood by neutering them. that's why they always tell you if you want to prevent spraying you must neuter them early.\nsamking86: I had my dog neutered at around 6 months hoping it would keep him from running off and looking for females. \n\nIt didn't work.\nAromatic-Box-592: Neutering isn\u2019t a magical fix all, neutered male dogs still think intact females smell *really* good (lol) but with training you should be able to stop him!\nsamking86: He has proven me wrong time and time again so now he gets put on his chain unless we are out there with him.

Approach. Ten years ago, the idea of closing the gap between the code and the expression of the partial behavior led to the implementation of the Reflectivity framework. Using Reflectivity, developers annotate Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes with meta-behavior which is taken into account by the compiler to produce behavioral variations. In this paper, we present Reflectivity, its API, its implementation and its usage in Pharo. We reflect on ten years of use of Reflectivity, and show how it has been used as a basic building block of many innovative ideas. Knowledge. Reflectivity brings a practical way of working at the AST level, which is a high-level representation of the source code manipulated by software developers. It enables a powerful way of dynamically add and modify behavior. Reflectivity is also a flexible mean to bridge the gap between the expression of the meta-behavior and the source code. This ability to apply unanticipated adaptation and to provide behavioral reflection led to many experiments and projects during this last decade by external users. Existing work use Reflectivity to implement reflective libraries or languages extensions, featherweight code instrumentation, dynamic software update, debugging tools and visualization and software analysis tools. Grounding. Reflectivity is actively used in research projects. During the past ten years, it served as a support, either for implementation or as a fundamental base, for many research work including PhD theses, conference, journal and workshop papers. Reflectivity is now an important library of the Pharo language, and is integrated at the heart of the platform. Importance. Reflectivity exposes powerful abstractions to deal with partial behavioral adaptation, while providing a mature framework for unanticipated, non-intrusive and partial behavioral reflection based on AST annotation. Furthermore, even if Reflectivity found its home inside Pharo, it is not a pure Smalltalk-oriented solution. As validation over the practical use of Reflectivity in dynamic object-oriented languages, the API has been ported to Python. Finally, the AST annotation feature of Reflectivity opens new experimentation opportunities about the control that developers could gain on the behavior of their own software."

Routing decisions can, however, contribute to collaborative detection of mobile malware by leveraging different kinds of anti-malware software installed on mobile devices. Benefiting from the cooperative nature of D2D communications, devices can rely on each other's contributions to detect malware. The impact of our work is geared towards having more malware-free D2D networks. To achieve this, we designed and implemented a novel routing protocol for D2D communications that optimises routing decisions for explicitly improving malware detection. The protocol identifies optimal network paths, in terms of malware mitigation and energy spent for malware detection, based on a game theoretic model. Diverse capabilities of network devices running different types of anti-malware software and their potential for inspecting messages relayed towards an intended destination device are leveraged using game theoretic tools. An optimality analysis of both Nash and Stackelberg security games is undertaken, including both zero and non-zero sum variants, and the Defender's equilibrium strategies. By undertaking network simulations, theoretical results obtained are illustrated through randomly generated network scenarios showing how our protocol outperforms conventional routing protocols, in terms of expected payoff, which consists of: security damage in inflicted by malware and malware detection cost."

This region probably shows properties similar to those characteristic of the inner shells around standard AGB stars: outwards expansion at about 5 - 25 km/s, with a significant acceleration of the gas, temperatures decreasing with radius between about 1000 and 500 K, and densities ~ 10$^9$ - 3 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Our model calculations are able to explain the asymmetric line shape observed in 12CO J=2-1 from R Aqr, in which the relatively weaker red part of the profile would result from selfabsorption by the outer layers (in the presence of a velocity increase and a temperature decrease with radius). The mass-loss rates are somewhat larger than in standard AGB stars, as often happens for symbiotic systems. In R Aqr, we find that the total mass of the CO emitting region is ~ 2 - 3 10$^{-5}$ Mo, corresponding to M' ~ 5 10$^{-6}$ - 10$^{-5}$ Mo/yr, and compatible with results obtained from dust emission. Taking into account other existing data on molecular emission, we suggest that the small extent of the molecule-rich gas in symbiotic systems is mainly due to molecule photodissociation by the radiation of the hot dwarf star."

On completion of her radar training, Hearn was posted to the radar station at Poling, West Sussex.\nOn 18 August 1940 (which became known as The Hardest Day) Leading Aircraftwoman (and acting Corporal) Hearn was on duty in the afternoon and was operating the telephone system passing radar plot information from the operators to Fighter Command HQ at RAF Bentley Priory, Stanmore.\nAround 2 pm the air raid sirens sounded and the staff were told to take cover. Hearn refused and carried on passing information from the plotters onto the control room. For the next 20 minutes Poling was bombed, accurately, by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77. At one point she was asked if she knew where the bombers were, to which she replied \"The course of the enemy bombers is only too apparent to me because the bombs are almost dropping on my head.\" Hearn remained at her post even though the telephone lines were cut.\nSignificant damage was done to the building Hearn was working in.  After the raid the damage was so extensive that the station was out of action for some weeks but no casualties were suffered among the station personnel. A temporary station was established nearby at Amering Woods at which Hearn served until Poling was back in service in October 1940.\nIn September 1940 the officer commanding Poling, Flight lieutenant Bayley recommended Hearn for the immediate award of the Military Medal. The recommendation was endorsed by Air commodore Gregory (AOC 60 Group) and further endorsed by Air chief marshal Dowding (AOC-in-chief Fighter Command) in November 1940.\nThe award of the Military Medal was published in the London Gazette on 10 January 1940.  Due to the secret nature of radar, the citation was less specific about Hearn's duties than the internal RAF memorandum.  The citation read \n\n880847 Acting Corporal Joan HEARN-AVIS.\n\u2014Women's Auxiliary Air Force.\n\nIn August, 1940, during an enemy air attack, bombs were dropped on buildings of the unit doing very considerable damage.  Several heavy bombs fell alongside a block where Corporal Hearn-Avis was working alone controlling telephones. Every window was blown in and one of the main walls of two rooms was badly cracked. Throughout the attack Corporal Hearn-Avis remained at her post in a building which threatened to collapse about her, doing her work as far as the terrific noise would permit. This airwoman displayed courage and devotion to duty of the highest order.\nThe incorrect description of her name was amended in the London Gazette on 7 March 1941.\nHearn was invested with her medal by King George VI at Buckingham Palace in March 1941.\nFollowing service at another radar station, Hearn spent the rest of the war as a radar instructor at No 8 Radio School at RAF Cranwell with the rank of Flight sergeant.\nAfter her wartime service Hearn returned to her pre-war trade as an upholsterer, eventually running her own business.\nAvis Hearn died at the RAF Benevolent Fund Princess Marina retirement home, Rustington, on 27 March 2008."

The challenge, then, is to generate appropriate inputs and to identify a metric that, for those inputs, is capable of representing the degree of functional similarity between two comparable DNN functions. Our approach uses random input with values between -1 and 1, in a shape that is compatible with what the DNN models expect. We then compare the outputs by performing correlation analysis. Our study shows how it is possible to perform similarity analysis even in the absence of meaningful canonical inputs. The response to random inputs of two comparable DNN functions exposes those functions' similarity, or lack thereof. Of all the metrics tried, we find that Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is the most powerful and versatile, although in special cases other methods and metrics are more expressive. We present a systematic empirical study comparing the effectiveness of several similarity metrics using a dataset of 56,355 classifiers collected from GitHub. This is accompanied by a sensitivity analysis that reveals how certain models' training related properties affect the effectiveness of the similarity metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows how similarity of DNN functions can be detected by using random inputs. Our study of correlation metrics, and the identification of Spearman correlation coefficient as the most powerful among them for this purpose, establishes a complete and practical method for DNN clone detection that can be used in the design of new tools. It may also serve as inspiration for other program analysis tasks whose approaches break in the presence of DNN components."

I am neither a conservative nor a Buddhist, but it's important to remember that Buddhism is not a political stance. Conservatism does not oppose charity and caring for others, it argues that state-based programs are ultimately ineffective (again, my point is not to defend or attack this belief).\n\nThough traditionally Buddhism is associated with liberalism in the United States, I would argue that Buddhism is just as separated from modern liberalism as it is conservatism. Remember, in most societies where Buddhism is prevalent, it is considered a conservative ideology. the Dalai Lama is quietly [far from a supporter of gay rights, abortion, or sexual freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama#Social_stances), though he is considered an economic liberal.\n\nHowever, despite this, my initial comment was really more directed at my observation that this article seems to have an air, at least from my perspective, that this interaction is inherently negative. Perhaps my observation was wrong. If this story gains traction, we'll see how people react.\nmrnovember5: I didn't take the negative view at all. In fact it seemed to highlight the AEI's stance that conservatism without morality is the root of why the Right is failing in the US. Without focusing on the moral needs to help the poor, Republicans are finding their support dwindling away. The AEI is trying to offer an alternative to simply swapping to the Left. Many people disagree with Left economics, but agree with Left social stance. Here in Canada we actually have a party that is fiscally right-leaning and socially left.\n\nIf anything this has lifted my opinion of the US Right and gives me some hope for the future of your country. Free market is still a concept held dear by most Americans, and having a free market option that also supports the poor would be a huge step up from having to choose between free market and the poor. It comes closer to the Christian ideals that Jesus espoused as well, versus the seemingly contradictory stance that the current GOP presents. That is, love Jesus, hate the poor, even though he preached that helping the poor is one of the highest forms of worship.\n"

Ive been on the routine for almost half a year now and I'm up to 60% bodyweight max dip and around 30% bodyweight added for 6 reps on pull-up to give a rough idea \npumpasaurus: You can't really base it on strength - it's mainly how your progress has been, and what your goals are. \n\nBasically, if you are still getting results, then you have the luxury of being able to choose whatever training structure you want. A full-body routine is the most time-efficient and usually involves the least amount of total work.\n\nIf you stall out and stop making any progress, and you're not feeling totally beat up (deload necessary), then the culprit is not doing enough work. Adding work might still allow a full-body routine, but the more work you do, the more sense it makes to split up the workouts so that you can focus and put the work in without having super long sessions.\nWolfeyRages: I'm able to progress strength wise, it just only seems to work with low reps high intensity \npumpasaurus: That's a good place to be.\n\nIf higher volume doesn't work for you, there's two reasons why: first, it's always less direct to train max strength in any way other than just directly progressing your intensity with higher weights (what you're doing), and as long as you can do it, you should - second, if you never do higher volume, your work capacity is probably fairly low, so you'd need to get used to higher volume in the first place for it to work.\n\nEventually the low-reps-high-intensity approach will stall out (unless you're a freak with great potential and you kind of achieve all your goals before it becomes necessary to mess with periodization and volume manipulation, which does happen), and it will require just adding extra work in order to have the body recognize that there's something happening that requires it to adapt.\nWolfeyRages: I definitely have low muscular endurance, I can't do more than 8 unweighted pull-ups which I will focus on for hypertrophy when the time comes, but for now I will take advantage of the low rep, hopefully it doesn't stall out before I achieve a few goals, but if it does atleast I know what I need to do, thanks \n"

Furthermore, we show that WPL outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in a more realistic setting of 100 agents interacting and learning concurrently. An important aspect of understanding the behavior of a MARL algorithm is analyzing the dynamics of the algorithm: how the policies of multiple learning agents evolve over time as agents interact with one another. Such an analysis not only verifies whether agents using a given MARL algorithm will eventually converge, but also reveals the behavior of the MARL algorithm prior to convergence. We analyze our algorithm in two-player-two-action games and show that symbolically proving WPLs convergence is difficult, because of the non-linear nature of WPLs dynamics, unlike previous MARL algorithms that had either linear or piece-wise-linear dynamics. Instead, we numerically solve WPLs dynamics differential equations and compare the solution to the dynamics of previous MARL algorithms."

Since you've mentioned that, i suggest increase the frequency of your pull up and push up training, but with a lower training volume. Grease the groove more days a week, with a lower intensity. If your trying to get familarised with a movement/do more reps, its best to keep practising it. I suggest greasing the groove about 3-4 times a week.\n\n\nEverytime you walk past a pull up bar, just do your 5 pull ups and 10 pushups. But spread it out throughout the day.

I used to walk past my pull up bar, and do a random number of pull ups each time. Just did it when i felt like it. \n\n\n\nIn short, reduce your training volume and increase training frequency so you can get familarised with the movement, resulting in better form and evantually more reps. Good luck!\nRough_Bonus: Awesome, what if I got to a park for pull-ups?\nhiiknowjoel: Grease the groove still applies. Rest when you feel like it, and do when you feel like it. If the park is located near your house, crank out a few reps when your on the way to school. Crank out some more when coming back home. Crank out some when your on the way to work. Crank out some when coming back home. I hope i answered your question.\nRough_Bonus: Thank you for your help\n"

Unless it is a double purpose card credit/debit, I don't understand how that can make sense. I never tried to run a debit card as credit. \nwanderingbilby: It's just confusion of nomenclature.  In this context:\n\n* Credit - \"Deferred verification\" - The debit card is swiped, and the customer signs for the purchase.  The purchase shows pending immediately on the checking account and clears in a few business days.  Called deferred verification because the verification of the purchase authorization comes when the merchant batches the transaction.  Also applies for all non-swiped transactions (online, telephone).\n\n* Debit - \"Immediate verification\" - The debit card is swiped and the customer enters their ATM PIN on a keypad.  The purchase shows pending immediately on the checking account and typically posts at the end of that business day.  Called immediate verification as the verification of authorization happens at the time of sale (via PIN verification).\n\n\nIn both cases the funds are *debiting* the checking account.\n\n**Note:** Some banks have a system where if you enter a PIN it comes from the checking account and if you swipe-and-sign it comes from an associated credit line.  Personally I think it's dumb since many merchants (and all online) don't have a PIN option.\nfer_d: Seems like a leftover from and old system, then? I don't understand the purpose, maybe it would be taken from your account the next day instead of immediately.\n\nAnd if the costumer can choose, then the merchant really has no control and has to use whatever the costumer decided. \nwanderingbilby: The way credit cards work period is a hold-over from the early days of the concept, when there was no way to electronically verify authorization.  Cards were recorded or carbon-copied on a machine that took an imprint, then the customer signed.  The paper copies were processed much like checks.  Now it's processed electronically but the same way - once a day at the end of the day as a 'batch' transmission.\n\nThe \"pending\" transaction you see immediately is simply the bank notifying you that they authorized a merchant to debit funds later.  How much later is the number of days it takes to go from \"pending\" to \"posted\".  Posted is when the funds actually leave the account and go to the merchant.\n\nPIN-Authorization is a newer system and was proposed as a method to allow customers to get cash back during the transaction and to reduce fraud.  It requires more equipment (the PIN pad) so there are still many small merchants that only have swipe-and-sign as an option.\n\nMerchants can have control by either not offering the PIN option or by de-emphasizing the option (having the PIN pad behind the counter, for instance).\n\nPlaces such as restaurants and bars rarely have the PIN option as you pay at the table rather than at a centralized POS system.\nfer_d: Thanks. Yes, that makes sense. \n"

Colonies of dermatophytes are usually restricted to the nonliving cornified layer of the epidermis because of their inability to penetrate the viable tissue of an immunocompetent host. Invasion does elicit a host response ranging from mild to severe. Acid proteinases (proteases), elastase, keratinases, and other proteinases reportedly act as virulence factors. Additionally, the products of these degradative enzymes serve as nutrients for the fungi. The development of cell-mediated immunity correlated with delayed hypersensitivity and an inflammatory response is associated with clinical cure, whereas the lack of or defective cell-mediated immunity predisposes the host to chronic or recurrent dermatophyte infection.\nSome of these skin infections are known as ringworm or tinea (which is the Latin word for \"worm\"), though infections are not caused by worms. It is thought that the word tinea (worm) is used to describe the snake-like appearance of the dermatophyte on the skin. Toenail and fingernail infections are referred to as onychomycosis. Dermatophytes usually do not invade living tissues, but colonize the outer layer of the skin. Occasionally the organisms do invade subcutaneous tissues, resulting in kerion development.\n\n"

The subdwarfs show some concentration to the galactic centre hemisphere with voids because of extinction in the Gould belt and galactic plane. Some yet unexplained overdensities of the evolved subdwarfs are seen in several parts of the sky. For 183 stars with radial velocities 3D motion and galactic orbits are calculated. For 56 stars with Fe/H collected from various sources we find the relations of the metallicity with CI, asymmetric drift velocity and orbital eccentricity.

Furthermore, if agents do not commence the search in synchrony then even initial communication is problematic. This holds, in particular, with respect to the question of whether the agents can communicate and conclude their total number, k. It turns out that the knowledge of k by the individual agents is crucial for performance. Indeed, it is a straightforward observation that the time required for finding the treasure is $\\Omega$(D + D 2 /k), and we show in this paper that this bound can be matched if the agents have knowledge of k up to some constant approximation. We present an almost tight bound for the competitive penalty that must be paid, in the running time, if agents have no information about k. Specifically, on the negative side, we show that in such a case, there is no algorithm whose competitiveness is O(log k). On the other hand, we show that for every constant $\\epsilon \\textgreater{} 0$, there exists a rather simple uniform search algorithm which is $O( \\log^{1+\\epsilon} k)$-competitive. In addition, we give a lower bound for the setting in which agents are given some estimation of k. As a special case, this lower bound implies that for any constant $\\epsilon \\textgreater{} 0$, if each agent is given a (one-sided) $k^\\epsilon$-approximation to k, then the competitiveness is $\\Omega$(log k). Informally, our results imply that the agents can potentially perform well without any knowledge of their total number k, however, to further improve, they must be given a relatively good approximation of k. Finally, we propose a uniform algorithm that is both efficient and extremely simple suggesting its relevance for actual biological scenarios."

        "text": " algorithm employed in the analysis is actually domain-independent and thus can be reused in principle, depending on how it is specified. While current approaches either implement static analyses internally or with an external Visitor, the implementation is tied to the language's grammar and cannot be reused easily. Thus far, a commonly used approach that achieves reusable static analysis relies on the transformation into an intermediate representation upon which the analysis is performed. This, however, entails a considerable additional implementation effort. Approach: To remedy this, it has been proposed to map the necessary domain-specific concepts to the algorithm's domain-independent data structures, yet without a practical implementation and the demonstration of reuse. Thus, to make static analysis reusable again, we employ relational Reference Attribute Grammars (RAGs) by creating such a mapping to a domain-independent overlay structure using higher-order attributes. Knowledge: We describe how static analysis can be specified on analysis-specific data structures, how relational RAGs can help with the specification, and how a mapping from the domain-specific language can be performed. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a static analysis for a DSL can be externalized and reused in another general purpose language. Grounding: The approach was evaluated using the RAG system JastAdd. To illustrate reusability, we implemented two analyses with two addressed languages each: a cycle detection analysis used in a small state machine DSL and for detecting circular dependencies in Java types and packages, and an analysis of variable shadowing, applied to both Java and the Modelica modelling language. Thereby, we demonstrate the reuse of two analysis algorithms in three completely different domains. Additionally, we use the cycle detection analysis to evaluate the efficiency by comparing our external analysis to an internal reference implementation analysing all Java programs in the Qualitas Corpus and thereby are able to show that an externalized analysis incurs only minimal overhead. Importance: We make static analysis reusable, again, showing the practicality and efficiency of externalizing static analysis for both DSLs and general purpose languages using relational RAGs."

The two polarized components are globally similar in structure along the plane and notably in the Fan and North Polar Spur regions.

Observations from space have the advantages of stability and the lack of atmospheric features which is important in such observations. We have therefore, as a first step in our searches, used the Odin satellite to perform two sets of spectral line surveys towards several positions. The first survey covered the band 547-578 GHz towards two positions, and the second one covered the bands 542.0-547.5 GHz and 486.5-492.0 GHz towards six positions selected to test different sizes of the primordial clouds. Two deep searches centred at 543.250 and 543.100 GHz with 1 GHz bandwidth were also performed towards one position. The two lowest rotational transitions of H2 will be redshifted to these frequencies from z~20-30, which is the predicted epoch of the first star formation. No lines are detected at an rms level of 14-90 and 5-35 mK for the two surveys, respectively, and 2-7 mK in the deep searches with a channel spacing of 1-16 MHz. The broad bandwidth covered allows a wide range of redshifts to be explored for a number of atomic and molecular species and transitions. From the theoretical side, our sensitivity analysis show that the largest possible amplitudes of the resonant lines are about 1 mK at frequencies <200 GHz, and a few micro K around 500-600 GHz, assuming optically thick lines and no beam-dilution. However, if existing, thermal absorption lines have the potential to be orders of magnitude stronger than the resonant lines. We make a simple estimation of the sizes and masses of the primordial perturbations at their turn-around epochs, which previously has been identified as the most favourable epoch for a detection. This work may be considered as an important pilot study for our forthcoming observations with the Herschel Space Observatory."

Motivation Since 2010, Renault has established a framework to develop engine control software for Diesel and Gasoline engines [6]. The framework is heavily based on MATLAB/Simulink and the idea of model-based development, which facilitates the carry-over and carry-across of application software between software projects. In the Renault EMS architecture software is composed in to about 20 functions, such as Air System, Combustion etc. A function consists of modules. A module is the smallest testable software unit and contains runnables to be scheduled and executed by the Operating System (Os) of the ECU. The Renault EMS development process includes basically the following steps [5]. 1. Specification of about 200 generic configurable modules per ECU using MATLAB/Simulink. 2. Generation of C code (EMS application software) from all module specifications using MATLAB/Simulink Embedded Coder. 3. MiL (Model in the Loop) test and validation of the resulting executable specifications at module level in a simulated system environment, considering only essential interactions with other modules and system environment. This is essentially a back-to-back test to make sure that the Simulink model of a module and the corresponding production C code show equivalent and intended behaviour. To insure software quality, this step is repeatedly performed with steps 1 and 2, based on the simulation capabilities of MATLAB/Simulink. 4. Configuration of modules to fit to the specific needs of a software project, such as absence or presence of certain components. 5. Integration of generated configured C code and hand-coded platform software (basic software) on supplied target hardware, a real ECU that communicates with other controllers via CAN and other busses. 6. Validation and test of all modules on system level using the real ECU. In contrast to step 3, the interactions of all modules and interactions with the system environment are visible then and subject to testing. For example, the Os runs all scheduled runnables then, not just those of the modules considered to be 'essential' for a module under test. Critical assessment of the above process shows that there is a considerable delay between delivery of a set of specifications to the software project team (at the end of step 3) and system-level tests based on an ECU that runs entire software (step 6). Typical delays are weeks or months."

To do this will require the introduction of a idle state event in the dataset that takes into account all different possibilities that are not task thinking. To validate the performance of the algorithms we will use the normalized Matthews Correlation Coefficient (nMCC) and the Information Transfer Rate (ITR). Main results: We analyzed the state-of-the-art algorithms of the last 15 years over several Motor Imagery (MI) datasets composed by several subjects, showing the differences between the two approaches from a statistical point of view.

For me, new is peace of mind for 10 years of 100k miles. And, once paid off, a 5 year loan, at 2.9%, i have at least 5 years of saving that payment for next vehicle or retirement. So, 10 years or no worries mechanically. Or, buy used and face issues that are not warrantied. I can see buying used, cash deal. No payments for how ever long car lasts. Which could be a week. Or 10 years. Manufacturers warranty is the difference for me.\nWaterBottleMaster45: &gt; few of us buy a car as investment to get a return.\n\nThe thing is why would you pay extra for the same car that just has been used a little to a mid amount as I said in another reply mileage matters.\nSmellsLikeWinning: The warranty. If problems occur, you pay zero.\nmy_chaffed_legs: Used cars have warranties too from the dealer.\nSmellsLikeWinning: Rarely, and if they do, it\u2019s likely close to the mileage cut off.\nwillowgrl: I got a new used Hyundai for significantly less than a brand new, and it had a 10 year/100,000 mile warranty. You\u2019re thinking of used cars more than 2 years old.\nSmellsLikeWinning: All I\u2019m saying is the original post is painting with too broad of a brush. New cars with warranties have their advantages, and not all cars lose value off the lot. Buy a new Toyota 4Runner and you\u2019ll sell it for the same or more in a couple years.\neskimoexplosion: Op didn't factor in credit, ltv as it applies to APR or the difference in depreciation between various vehicles. With Toyota trucks its almost always better to go new vs slightly used. My buddy bought a TRD Pro Taco a couple years back and basically broke even on it when he sold it this year\n"

I'm saying that any input we have is itself caused by factors outside our control. (That is \"who we are\" and what decisions we make is all based on an inextricably causal relationship with our experiences and physical reality (genetics etc.))\nthe_iowa_corn: Sure.  Input that we experience may not be completely within our control, but we can work towards decisions that improve the odds that these inputs favor the decisions that we plan on making.  \n\nIf I never walk near a gym, I'll never work out in it.  If I decide to walk into a gym, then the chance of me working out at the gym is higher.  Sure I can get hit by a car along the way.  That event is outside of my control, but that doesn't mean I cannot have certain level of control over my own life, that is, walking to a gym so I can work out.\n\nPerhaps we are discussing different issues?  If so, I'm sorry if I am not being clear.\nCultist_O: I'm saying your deciding to walk into the gym is ultimately caused entirely by factors outside your \"control\", such as whether you were raised/genetically predisposed to value or enjoy such things.\nthe_iowa_corn: Do you feel that you have any free will then?\nCultist_O: I cannot even conceptualize what most people seem to think free will is. I believe humans are particularly complex organic machines, and that nothing, including human thought, happens outside causality.\n\nIf instead you are asking me if I feel that my actions are my own, rather than being directly controlled by a third party, such as a deity, alien, or other human, then I feel my actions are my own.\nthe_iowa_corn: Ahh...I see. Then let me ask from a practical point of view. \n\nDo you think a murderer or rapist should be punished for their actions?  \n\nI suppose that's ultimately what matters at the end of the day.  The idea of \"free will\" implies there's individual responsibility behind our actions.  So whether you believe people should be rewarded and punished for their decisions in life is more of what I'm interested in. \nCultist_O: Is the punishment likely to prevent harm? Such as by deterring this or other would be criminals in future, or by making a second attempt more difficult (like through incarceration)?\n\nIf not, then two wrongs do not make a right, vengeance is not justice, etc.\nthe_iowa_corn: I see. Okay.  I suppose we just believe differently in how much \"control\" we exert onto our own lives.  Thanks for the discussion though.  \nCultist_O: Ya, I really wish someone could explain this concept of \"control\" to me. Because at a fundamental level I don't even know what you are saying you believe in. The idea of an uncaused cause is just so nonsensical to me.\n"

In the forecasting process either the pattern rule base or the Sugeno fuzzy rule base can be used. The first option is desirable when the computational resources make it possible to deal with the overall pattern rule base or when the extracted fuzzy rules are not accurate enough due to uncertainty associated to the original data. In the second option, the prediction process is done by means of the classical Sugeno inference system. If the amount of uncertainty associated to the data is small, the predictions obtained using the Sugeno fuzzy rule base will be very accurate. In this paper a mixed pattern/fuzzy rules strategy is proposed to deal with uncertainty in such a way that the best of both perspectives is used. Areas in the data space with a higher level of uncertainty are identified by means of the so-called error models. The prediction process in these areas makes use of a mixed pattern/fuzzy rules scheme, whereas areas identified with a lower level of uncertainty only use the Sugeno fuzzy rule base. The proposed strategy is applied to a real biomedical system, i.e., the central nervous system control of the cardiovascular system."

It's not good, and many farmers would like to see more competition amongst seed providers. However, the article fails to mention that increased seed prices are accompanied by greatly decreased costs of raising the patented crops, potentially resulting in overall savings. A huge amount of seeds are patented, and there's a rational reason why so many farmers are deciding to purchase them.\n\nAnd back to the case--there's the whole fact that Mr. Bowman said that he knew the seeds he bought probably contained patented seeds. And that he is very familiar with the clauses in Monsanto's contracts that prohibits planting those seeds. His whole defense boils down to, \"I didn't think they would care that much,\" and then acts surprised when Monsanto does, in fact, care.\nBigSlowTarget: &gt;His whole defense boils down to, \"I didn't think they would care that much,\" and then acts surprised when Monsanto does, in fact, care.\n\nI have to disagree here. The issue is not whether or not Monsanto cares but if Monsanto has the right to dictate uses of the seeds throughout the supply chain. The consequence is significant - If it does then you are running the risk of breaking the law should you ever decide to plant something you buy at the grocery store or for that matter obtain from any source anywhere. \n\nThis is a self replicating technology and does not require any other technology to replicate. At the point of sale there were no contracts signed to limit it's use. The product is deliberately mixed in and made indistinguishable with non-patented items to increase marketability. Each of those are significant facts. It seems to me there is much more than Monsanto didn't care going on here.\n[deleted]: I agree with you, and thanks for the response--his legal defense certainly entails more than just \"I thought they wouldn't care\". It seems like I was speaking more to his justification. Mr. Bowman has said that he was well aware of Monsanto's control over the seeds, he knew he couldn't plant Monsanto seeds without infringing, that the seeds that he bought probably contained Monsanto seeds, and that he didn't think they'd care since the affect on their market would be minimal. Basically, he knew he was probably infringing, but did it anyways.\n\nOf course, his legal defense will incorporate sophisticated doctrinal arguments. There are huge consequences in terms of setting a precedent for patent exhaustion as it applies to self-replicating technologies, and also for the mixing/labeling issues. It gets more pressing when we consider that patent infringement is a strict liability tort, so lack of knowledge is not a defense.\n\nThat being said, if a precedent is set on self-replicating technologies, I really hope it's not influenced by Mr. Bowman's knowledge (or willful blindness) that he was infringing.\n"

The results are different from those commonly used, and in particular those from standards (ISO 11929). Their statistical performances, characterized by simulation, are better and are well verified experimentally. This is confirmed theoretically by the use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma which makes it possible to formally determine the statistical tests with the best performances. These results also make it possible to understand the paradox of the possible divergence of the detection limit. It is also formally shown that the confidence intervals thus calculated by getting rid of the nuisance parameter according to established methods result in the commonly used confidence interval. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first formal derivation of these confidence intervals.This method is based on keeping the measurement results whether they are significant or not (not censoring them). This is recommended in several standards or documents, is compatible with the ISO 11929 standard and is in line with recent proposals in the field of statistics. On the other hand, all the information necessary to determine whether a measurement result is significant or not remains available. The conservation and restitution of all results is currently applied in the USA. The textbook case of the WIPP incident makes it possible to ensure favorable public perception.The implications and applications of this method in different fields are finally discussed."

        "text": " tools. Our first contribution consists in identifying an interesting special case of WSC which is both significant and more tractable. The special case, which we term \"forward effects\", is characterized by the fact that every ramification of a web service application involves at least one new constant generated as output by the web service. We show that, in this setting, the reasoning required for belief update simplifies to standard reasoning in the ontology itself. This relates to, and extends, current notions of \"message-based\" WSC, where the need for belief update is removed by a strong (often implicit or informal) assumption of \"locality\" of the individual messages. We clarify the computational properties of the forward effects case, and point out a strong relation to standard notions of planning under uncertainty, suggesting that effective tools for the latter can be successfully adapted to address the former. Furthermore, we identify a significant sub-case, named \"strictly forward effects\", where an actual compilation into planning under uncertainty exists. This enables us to exploit off-the-shelf planning tools to solve message-based WSC in a general form that involves powerful ontologies, and requires reasoning about partial matches between concepts. We provide empirical evidence that this approach may be quite effective, using Conformant-FF as the underlying planner."

Donington Park staged the trophy's following two races in 1937 and 1938 after a major accident involving a Riley car during the 1936 edition killed eight onlookers and injured another 25. Following the Second World War, it returned to Northern Ireland and was held on the shorter Dundrod Circuit; a second major crash that killed three competitors in 1955 led the local authorities to bar all future car races on the track. Since then, the race has occurred on permanent racing circuits rather than closed public road tracks.\nJohn Napier in an Arrol-Johnston was the event's inaugural winner in 1905. The first non-British driver to win the race was the Frenchman Jean Chassagne, who drove a Sunbeam Tourist Trophy car to victory in the 1922 race. Italian driver Tazio Nuvolari became the first driver in history to claim the trophy in 1933 to accompany it with an overall victory in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the same year.

Unless you're doing advanced work like planche or back lever training which I said, but I'm assuming you didn't read that either. \n\nAlso why are you bringing up powerlifting and bodybuilding. That's completely irrelevant\n\nLastly I never said single sets don't work. I said twice that I do them all the time and they're greatly effective but again guess you didn't read that \ntoonnolten: You can tell a beginner as many times as you want to watch their form but even when not fatigued they probably won't have good form. Single sets can challenge you just as much as any other type of training, it just depends on the weight or progression you're working at. Calling something a fact doesn't make it a fact.\nHow is powerlifting and bodybuilding irrelevant? They're both forms of strength training that involve competition. If circuits really were a superior training method, wouldn't they be doing them?\nI have no idea why you frown on powerlifting and bodybuilding but not oly lifting. You can add gymnasts to that if you want btw, show me a high level gymnast who primarily uses circuit training.\ngregoryscottfit: You can't make a statement like the first one that you made. Everybody is different man. You're completely missing the point of everything now for a second time. I literally said that I train single sets all the time and that they're a necessity as you get to a higher level. It's all in my post and reply yet you don't acknowledge it. \n\nI said powerlifting and bodybuilding and is irrelevant to this discussion. \n\nI didn't say anything was superior. I said that all three of these things have their own special place within a training program \n\nYou're just not very receptive to anything I'm saying at this point\n\nAgree to disagree \n"

In a second part, after a reminder of the points to be improved, we exhibit the Version 5 which brings, we think, relevant improvements. Indeed: 5) We consider the weighted averages of the variables; this introduces probabilities. 6) We define two observables (L average of information flux and A activity of the network) which could be measured and so be compared with experimental results. 7) We find that L , weighted average of information flows, is an invariant. 8) Finally, we propose two expressions for the conactance, from which we deduce the corresponding Lagrange equations which have to be solved to know the evolution of the considered weighted averages. But, at the present stage, we think that we can progress only by carrying out experiments (see projects like Human brain project) and discovering invariants, symmetries which would allow us, like in Physics, to classify networks and above all to understand better the connections between them. Indeed, and that is what we propose among the future research ways, the underlying problem is to understand how, after their learning period, several networks can connect together to produce, in the brain case for instance, what we call mental states."

Users of historical newspaper collections have so far commented effects of OCR'ed data quality mainly in impressionistic ways, and controlled user environments for studying effects of OCR quality on users' relevance assessments of the retrieval results have so far been missing. To remedy this The National Library of Finland (NLF) set up an experimental query environment for the contents of one Finnish historical newspaper, Uusi Suometar 1869-1918, to be able to compare users' evaluation of search results of two different OCR qualities for digitized newspaper articles. The query interface was able to present the same underlying document for the user based on two alternatives: either based on the lower OCR quality, or based on the higher OCR quality, and the choice was randomized. The users did not know about quality differences in the article texts they evaluated. The main result of the study is that improved optical character recognition quality affects perceived usefulness of historical newspaper articles significantly. The mean average evaluation score for the improved OCR results was 7.94% higher than the mean average evaluation score of the old OCR results."

Therefore, despite the great potentials of the traffic monitoring cameras, the 4L characteristics hinder them from providing useful traffic state information (e.g., speed, flow, density). This paper focuses on the traffic density estimation problem as it is widely applicable to various traffic surveillance systems. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of the holistic framework for addressing the 4L characteristics and extracting the traffic density information from traffic monitoring camera data. In view of this, this paper proposes a framework for estimating traffic density using uncalibrated traffic monitoring cameras with 4L characteristics. The proposed framework consists of two major components: camera calibration and vehicle detection. The camera calibration method estimates the actual length between pixels in the images and videos, and the vehicle counts are extracted from the deep-learning-based vehicle detection method. Combining the two components, high-granular traffic density can be estimated. To validate the proposed framework, two case studies were conducted in Hong Kong and Sacramento. The results show that the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in camera calibration is less than 0.2 meters out of 6 meters, and the accuracy of vehicle detection under various conditions is approximately 90%. Overall, the MAE for the estimated density is 9.04 veh/km/lane in Hong Kong and 1.30 veh/km/lane in Sacramento. The research outcomes can be used to calibrate the speed-density fundamental diagrams, and the proposed framework can provide accurate and real-time traffic information without installing additional sensors."

Approach: We evaluate the language in its current state and develop a model that captures the essence of its approach to gradual types. We draw upon personal communication, bug reports, and the Static Python regression test suite to develop this model. Knowledge: Our main finding is that the gradual soundness that arises from a mix of concrete and transient types is an effective way to lower the maintenance cost of the concrete approach. We also find that method-based JIT technology can eliminate the costs of the transient approach. On a more technical level, this paper describes two contributions: a model of Static Python and a performance evaluation of Static Python. The process of formalization found several errors in the implementation, including fatal errors. Grounding: Our model of Static Python is implemented in PLT Redex and tested using property-based soundness tests and 265 tests from the Static Python regression suite. This paper includes a small core of the model to convey the main ideas of the Static Python approach and its soundness. Our performance claims are based on production experience in the Instagram web server. Migrations to Static Python in the server have caused a 3.7\\% increase in requests handled per second at maximum CPU load. Importance: Static Python is the first sound gradual language whose piece-meal application to a realistic codebase has consistently improved performance. Other language designers may wish to replicate its approach, especially those who currently maintain unsound gradual languages and are seeking a path to soundness."

Due to its relative inertia, the real economy is bound to be more affected by these constant variations than the financial markets.At the micro-scale we compute the transition functions of individual agents and study their probabilistic dynamics in a given collective state, as a function of their initial state. We show that capital accumulation of an individual agent depends on various factors. The probability associated with each firm's trajectories is the result of several contradictory effects: the firm tends to shift towards sectors with the greatest long-term return, but must take into account the impact of its shift on its attractiveness for investors throughout its trajectory. Since this trajectory depends largely on the average capital of transition sectors, a firm's attractiveness during its relocation depends on the relative level of capital in those sectors. Moreover, the firm must also consider the effects of competition in the intermediate sectors that tends to oust under-capitalized firm towards sectors with lower average capital. For investors, capital allocation depends on their short and long-term returns and investors will tend to reallocate their capital to maximize both. The higher their level of capital, the stronger the re-allocation will be."

After correcting for dust attenuation the median fraction of total FUV emission from regions outside of R25 is 1.7%, but it can be as high as 35% in the most extreme cases. The corresponding fractions of Halpha emission are approximately half as large on average. This difference reflects both a slightly lower ratio of Halpha to UV emission in the HII regions in the outer discs, as well as a lower fraction of star clusters showing HII regions. Most HII regions in the extended disc have fluxes consistent with small numbers of ionising O-type stars, and this poor sampling of the upper initial mass function in small clusters can probably account for the differences in the emission properties, consistent with earlier conclusions by Zaritsky & Christlein (2007), without needing to invoke a significant change in the stellar IMF itself. Consistent Ha/FUV ratios and brightest HII region to total Halpha fluxes in the inner and extended discs across our whole galaxy sample demonstrate no evidence for a change in the cluster luminosity function or the IMF in the low gas density outer disc."

In this work we disprove this conjecture, showing that the period of parallel rotor-router walks can in fact, be superpolynomial in the size of graph. On the positive side, we provide a characterization of the periodic behavior of parallel router walks, in terms of a structural property of stable states called a subcycle decomposition. This property provides us the tools to efficiently detect whether a given system configuration corresponds to the transient or to the limit behavior of the system. Moreover, we provide polynomial upper bounds of $O(m^4 D^2 + mD \\log k)$ and $O(m^5 k^2)$ on the number of steps it takes for the system to stabilize. Thus, we are able to predict any future behavior of the system using an algorithm that takes polynomial time and space. In addition, we show that there exists a separation between the stabilization time of the single-walk and multiple-walk rotor-router systems, and that for some graphs the latter can be asymptotically larger even for the case of $k = 2$ walks."

This allows us to propose significant improvements of typical autoassociative neural networks, often used to denoise hyperspectral Earth remote sensing data. Applying this method to the 13 CO (1 -- 0) cube, we compare the denoised data with those derived with the multiple Gaussian fitting algorithm ROHSA, considered as the state of the art procedure for data line cubes.Results. The nature of astronomical spectral data cubes is distinct from that of the hyperspectral data usually studied in the Earth remote sensing literature because the observed intensities become statistically independent beyond a short channel separation. This lack of redundancy in data has led us to adapt the method, notably by taking into account the sparsity of the signal along the spectral axis. The application of the proposed algorithm leads to an increase of the SNR in voxels with weak signal, while preserving the spectral shape of the data in high SNR voxels.Conclusions. The proposed algorithm that combines a detailed analysis of the noise statistics with an innovative autoencoder architecture is a promising path to denoise radio-astronomy line data cubes. In the future, exploring whether a better use of the spatial correlations of the noise may further improve the denoising performances seems a promising avenue. In addition,"

        "text": "{Connes_Sullivan_Teleman}. In this article we introduce localised algebras (Definition 3) $\\mathit{A}$ and in \\S 6 we define their local algebraic $K$-theory. A localised algebra $\\mathit{A}$ is an algebra in which a decreasing filtration by vector sub-spaces $\\mathit{A}_{\\mu}$ is introduced. The filtration $\\mathit{A}_{\\mu}$ induces a filtration on the space of matrices $\\mathbb{M}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$. Although we define solely $K^{loc}_{\\ast}(\\mathit{A})$ for $\\ast= 0, \\; 1$, we expect our construction could be extended in higher degrees. We stress that our construction of $K^{loc}_{0}(\\mathit{A})$ uses exclusively idempotent matrices and that the use of finite projective modules is totally avoided. (Idempotent matrices, rather than projective modules, contain less arbitrariness in the description of the $K_{0}$ classes and allow a better filtration control). The group $K^{loc}_{0}(\\mathit{A})$ is by definition the quotient space of the space of the Grothendieck completion of the space of idempotent matrices through three equivalence relations: -i) stabilisation $\\sim_{s}$, -2) local conjugation $\\sim_{l}$, {\\em and} -3) projective limit with respect to the filtration. By definition, the $K_{1}^{loc} (\\mathit{A})$ is the projective limit of the local $K_{1}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ groups. The group $K_{1}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ is by definition the quotient of $\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ modulo the equivalence relation generated by: -1) stabilisation $\\sim_{s}$, --2) local conjugation $\\sim_{l}$ and -3) $\\sim_{\\mathbb{O}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})}$, where $\\mathbb{O}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ is the sub-module generated by elements of the form $ u \\oplus u^{-1} $, for any $u \\in \\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$. The class of any invertible element $u$ modulo conjugation (inner auto-morphisms) we call the Jordan canonical form of $u$. The local conjugation preserves the local Jordan canonical form of invertible elements. The equivalence relation $\\sim_{\\mathbb{O}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})}$ insures existence of opposite elements in $K_{1}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ and $K_{1}^{loc}(\\mathit{A})$. Our definition of $K^{loc}_{1}(\\mathit{A})$ does not use the commutator sub-group $[\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}), \\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A})]$ nor elementary matrices in its construction. We define short exact sequences of localised algebras. To get the corresponding (open) six terms exact sequence (Theorem 51) one has to take the tensor product of the expected six terms exact sequence by $\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1}{2}]$. We expect the factor $\\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1}{2}}]$ to have important consequences. Our work shows that the basic structure of $K_{1}$ resides in the {\\em additive} sub-group generated by elements of the form $u \\oplus u^{-1}$, $u \\in \\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A})$, rather than in the {\\em multiplicativ} commutator sub-group $[\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}), \\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A})]$. Even into the case of trivially filtered algebras, $\\mathit{A}_{\\mu} = \\mathit{A}$, for all $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the introduced group $K^{loc}_{1}(\\mathit{A})$ should provide more information than the classical group $K_{1}(\\mathit{A})$."

But then there exist traditionally married families with children in the double figures or uncaring, work-driven fathers so this isn't the fault of polygamy. \n\nI really don't see how anything you've said is worse than the current state of marriage in which wealthy men have wives and several mistresses. Any why is that morally wrong anyway? The women live in splendor and the man gets his sexy time. They're all consenting adults here.\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: One man having 20 wives creates a surplus of male children that must be driven off to preserve the status quo, this is how polygamy is practiced in the real world. \nimjusthereforkitties: Contraception?\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: How would contraception help? They want numerous children, they don't want men to compete for wives with. \nimjusthereforkitties: Oh i thought the kids would be accidents if they were being driven away upon maturation. Well that sucks, though i still think polygamy would go down differently in western culture...but i guess this is what FallingSnowAngel said about polygamy's difference as an abstract and an ideal.\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: Polygamy is in like this in America in fundamentalist morman communities, that might not be the West you were thinking of but it's hard to think of a religion more American. The problem with polygamy is that it can't be a relationship between equals. The man makes the decisions and the women have to live with it. I don't have a problem with polyamory, but a system where a man can have an unlimited number of wives to use and control does seem morally and ethically suspect. If people have freedom to choose, education, opportunities it doesn't seem like a relationship that is based on women being property would organically arise. While monogamy has it's roots in property exchange, we have dating today, marriage is based on friendship, love, affection, commitment regardless of gender and not the economic and political institution it was originally created to be. Egalitarian group marriage is a whole nother can of worms, nothing wrong with having a poly family and it obviously works for some but I can't begin to imagine how to address the issue legislatively. If marriage is about love and building a life and creating a family (not necessarily children) then we should be able to find a way, but we certainly haven't gotten there yet.\n"

Most existing reactive programming languages and frameworks have limited support for managing acquaintances, resulting in accidental complexity of the code or inefficient computations. In this paper we present acquaintance management for reactive programs. First, we design an *acquaintance discovery* mechanism to create a *flock* that automatically discovers prosumers on the network. An important aspect of flocks is their integration with reactive programs, such that a reactive program can correctly and efficiently maintain its state. To this end we design an *acquaintance maintenance* mechanism: a new type of operator for functional reactive programming languages that we call `deploy-*`. The `deploy-*` operator enables correct and efficient reactions to time-varying collections of discovered prosumers. The proposed mechanisms are implemented in a reactive programming language called Stella, which serves as a linguistic vehicle to demonstrate the ideas of our approach. Our implementation of acquaintance management results in computationally efficient and idiomatic reactive code. We evaluate our approach quantitatively via benchmarks that show that our implementation is efficient: computations will efficiently update whenever a new prosumer is discovered, or a connected prosumer is dropped. To evaluate the distributed capabilities of our prototype implementation, we implement a use-case that simulates the bike-sharing infrastructure of Brussels, and we run it on a Raspberry Pi cluster computer. We consider our work to be an important step to use functional reactive programming to build distributed systems for open networks, in other words, distributed reactive programs that involve many prosumer devices and sensors that spontaneously join and leave the network."

In this paper, we are concerned with the high-level software component(s) responsible for the decisions in an AV. We intend to model an AV capable of navigation; obstacle avoidance; obstacle selection (when a crash is unavoidable) and vehicle recovery, etc, using a rational agent. To achieve this, we have established the following stages. First, the agent plans and actions have been implemented within the Gwendolen agent programming language. Second, we have built a simulated automotive environment in the Java language. Third, we have formally specified some of the required agent properties through LTL formulae, which are then formally verified with the AJPF verification tool. Finally, within the MCAPL framework (which comprises all the tools used in previous stages) we have obtained formal verification of our AV agent in terms of its specific behaviours. For example, the agent plans responsible for selecting an obstacle with low potential damage, instead of a higher damage obstacle (when possible) can be formally verified within MCAPL. We must emphasise that the major goal (of our present approach) lies in the formal verification of agent plans, rather than evaluating real-world applications. For this reason we utilised a simple matrix representation concerning the environment used by our agent."

If someone is making small talk that they just want me to listen to, then I use the smile and nod with an occasional \"Uh huh!\", and pick up the gist of what they are saying through the various bits of the sentence I can properly hear. I do this now almost subconsciously, and I've become VERY good at putting together the general message they are trying to convey, even though I hear probably 50% of it. I'm also VERY in tune with body language. So much of conversation is unspoken, if you can learn to trust your instinct with the body language and even gather bits and pieces of a conversation you would be amazed at how well people think you are listening. Most people say I'm one of the best listeners they have ever talked to, but really half of what they are saying I don't hear, so the other half I intently focus on, and I basically pantomime their body langue back at them, it really gives a great impression of empathy, and I just use canned responses in combination, to come off as understanding.\n\nIn those circumstances where the conversation warrants a back and forth I just do the best I can. If I can't understand them I simply say \"Sorry, I can't hear you can you repeat that?\". If I have to ask more than twice I explain that my hearing is unfortunately not that great, and almost everyone has been very understanding. Some people laugh at me when I explain why my hearing is sub-par, and then I ask them what is funny about the situation, and move on to a better person who isn't going to judge me over what I perceive as a very, very small inconvenience to them.\n[deleted]: Ok thanks, I'll try to read body language. But I already do the \"Uh-uh\" smile, etc. thing and I end up agreeing or laughing if it's a joke that I didn't even understand what they said. Sometimes one of my ears goes a little deaf but it comes back after a couple of minutes. It happens with either my left or right. I'll still go see a professional and see what it might be.

It is widely believed that there are two distinct loci of computation in sentence processing: syntactic parsing and semantic interpretation. One longstanding controversy is which of these two modules bears responsibility for the immediate resolution of ambiguity. My claim is that it is the latter, and that the syntactic processing module is a very simple device which blindly and faithfully constructs all possible analyses for the sentence up to the current point of processing. The interpretive module serves as a filter, occasionally discarding certain of these analyses which it deems less appropriate for the ongoing discourse than their competitors. This document is divided into three parts. The first is introductory, and reviews a selection of proposals from the sentence processing literature. The second part explores a body of data which has been adduced in support of a theory of structural preferences --- one that is inconsistent with the present claim. I show how the current proposal can be specified to account for the available data, and moreover to predict where structural preference theories will go wrong. The third part is a theoretical investigation of how well the proposed architecture can be realized using current conceptions of linguistic competence. In it, I present a parsing algorithm and a meaning-based ambiguity resolution method."

Four additional monarchs were given an Icling pedigree in later genealogical sources but are now believed to have descended from the family by way of Penda's sister.\nIcel himself is of debatable historicity; according to Nicholas Brooks, if historical he would have lived sometime between 450 and 525 and was probably considered the founder of the dynasty because he was the first of his line in Britain. Despite the Icelingas' claims of ties with the rulers and mythic heroes of continental Angeln and with the war-god Woden, Brooks suggests that the Icelingas were, before Penda's rise in prominence, no more and no less royal than any of the other ruling houses of the small Midlands peoples as recorded in the Tribal Hidage and assessed as having between 300 and 600 hides of land.\nIcel's ancestry in genealogical tradition is as follows: Icel son of Eomer son of Angeltheow son of Offa son of Wermund son of Wihtl\u00e6g son, grandson or great-grandson of Woden.\nIn this tradition, Icel is the leader of the Angles who migrated to Britain. Icel is then separated from the establishment of Mercia by three generations: Icel's son was Cnebba, whose son was Cynewald, whose son was Creoda, first king of Mercia.\nMatthew Paris s.a. 527 reports, \"pagans came from Germania and occupied East Anglia... some of whom invaded Mercia and fought many battles with the British[.]\" This date, however, should perhaps be amended to 515.\nThe Vita Sancti Guthlaci (\"Life of Saint Guthlac\") reports Guthlac of Crowland to have been son of Penwalh, a Mercian who could trace his pedigree back to Icel.\nSeveral place names in England have been suggested as derived from the name of Icel or the Iclingas, including Icklingham, Ickleford, Ickleton and Ixworth. Norman Scarfe noted that the Icknield Way had early spellings Icenhylte weg and Icenhilde weg and suggested a connection between Icklingham and the Iceni, although Warner (1988) has cast doubt on the identification.

While we identified certain limitations in GPT-4's handling of MCQs and coding exercises, the rate of improvement across the recent generations of GPT models strongly suggests their potential to handle almost any type of assessment widely used in higher education programming courses. These findings could be leveraged by educators and institutions to adapt the design of programming assessments as well as to fuel the necessary discussions into how programming classes should be updated to reflect the recent technological developments. This study provides evidence that programming instructors need to prepare for a world in which there is an easy-to-use widely accessible technology that can be utilized by learners to collect passing scores, with no effort whatsoever, on what today counts as viable programming knowledge and skills assessments."

She said she was leaving work early, and we'd meet at her hair dressers. I was aghast at the hair dresser running fingers through her hair, primping, and cooing over \"how beautiful your hair is\" that she gave my sister. That is the $40 difference.\n\nAll I ever got from a barber, was locker-room jokes ... he got his $3 tip. The last time I went to a barber was about 1992. We were poor and to save money, my wife bought a $20 hair clipper from Longs. She's cut my hair for the past 27 years. I think we're on our 4 hair clipper, so $80 for 27 years. Less than $3 a year is pretty affordable. The tips are a little different though.\nTheVastWaistband: Are you kidding?\n\nThere are many men only barbershops here set you up with a beer when you walk in. Then they do scalp massage, and do a traditional hot towel treatment and shave with straight razor. They also do nose hair, ear, and unibrow waxing and fingernail filing and buffing.\n\nAlso, you say you don't even go to barbershops and do at home buzzcuts....so you're proclaiming yourself uniquely uninformed in your opinion\nElectricRook1: Why should I waste my money on getting my ego massaged?\nTheVastWaistband: ....you know that taking the time to get a nice haircut and a.shave doesn't mean you're some kind of pussy or faggot right? Maybe you have some sort of insecurity in that area or some self loathing where you don't want to spend money on yourself. Regardless, this is a normal thing for most guys.\nElectricRook1: Yes, maybe I have a loathing to spend money on myself. I don't care what other people do with their money, how they want to spend it, or light it on fire for all I care.\n\nThe fight wakes up in me, when people start talking about how awful it is that they have to pay too much for hygiene products ... when they have brushed off all frugality to buy premium products, then call for price controls when they themselves are the root of poor value by selecting only premium products.\n"

How would the majority of academics define it?\nJurgioslakiv: We don't actually use the sciences etc to build theories of knowledge. We use them to build knowledge sets, but not to answer the question, \"What is knowledge?\" Philosophy tries to figure out what counts as knowledge, what are the requirements for something to be true, etc, which is quite different from what the sciences and other areas of study are doing.\n\nAt the core of every discipline lies philosophy though. At some point every discipline relies on philosophical tenets and axioms in order to start. The sciences for instance, rely on certain claims established in philosophy of science. So to that extent it's not as much that philosophy needs to use math, science, economics etc, but rather that all of those disciplines inherently use philosophy at their core.\nRed_Marcus: ok, so philosophy provides us with the axioms we need to actually do the other disciplines.\n\nThe example I was thinking of Karl Marx's political philosophy. He developed a utopian system in his head, but had he used more empirical data or deductive reasoning (which doesn't deductive still count as philosophy?), maybe he would have trashed his model.\n\nSo I'm trying to understand to what extent philosophy is considered the establishment of axioms to build other areas of inquiry off of, and to what extent philosophy builds models off of these axioms. \"What is truth?\" would be considered axiomatic level and \"overthrow the proletariat\" is based off of many more assumptions, but they are both considered philosophy. \nyelbesed: As the marxist theories have caused hundreds of millions of death and oppression in his name I would not use him when I start out to define philosophy. In spite of some kind of rebel popularity of it in some corners.\nRed_Marcus: Yeah maybe that was in bad taste. Don't take it the wrong way, I love capitalism. I was just trying to figure out what part of philosophy is the sort of theoretical foundation, \"what is truth\" kind of questions and what part of philosophy is the more practical (or in my example horrific) kind of questions like \"we should all share everything\". \n"

However, such a performance evaluation of different allocation and mapping strategies usually relies either on directly running them on the targeted execution environments, which can rapidly become extremely time-and resource-consuming, or on resorting to the simulation of simplified models of the components of an in-situ workflow, which can lack of realism. In both cases, the validity of the performance evaluation is limited. To address this issue, we introduce SIM-SITU, a framework for the faithful simulation of in-situ workflows. This framework builds on the SimGrid toolkit and benefits of several important features of this versatile simulation tool. We designed SIM-SITU to reflect the typical structure of in-situ workflows and thanks to its modular design, SIM-SITU has the necessary flexibility to easily and faithfully evaluate the behavior and performance of various allocation and mapping strategies for in-situ workflows. We illustrate the simulation capabilities of SIM-SITU on a Molecular Dynamics use case. We study the impact of different allocation and mapping strategies on performance and show how users can leverage SIM-SITU to determine interesting tradeoffs when designing their in-situ workflow."

Good luck, OP.\nShadomd: I completely understand! I figured it was worth a try to ask for help regardless. The table is $700 alone, I do have a friend who has certain tools and is willing to help me however he has only built bedframes and beehives from what I know. He hasn't built a table before but he offered to help regardless. Say if I had a table saw, router, drill press, and cut off saw would it make it easier to make?\nLittleJackass80: Absolutely. So let's say you don't really need to buy tools and you just have to get lumber and fasteners. My first step would be looking at what kind of wood I'd want and how I'm going to assemble the top. The other pieces, the legs, aprons, etc, you could use a wood that isn't as nice, but the top matters. This is especially challenging because you want to stain - which hides much less imperfection than paint, so the wood has to be nice to begin with.\n\nAssemble the top sounds like overkill, but you have to consider you won't find a slab of wood that size for a decent price, so you'll be joining some more narrow pieces together to form the wider top. (There are more tools involved here, however let's not consider them for now, let's just focus on the lumber.) Pine or Fir is going to be the cheapest and most available to you in big box stores. It also looks the cheapest and is soft and will easily pick up markings from writing on the table/pressing too hard. There are also more knots and imperfections in this type of wood. If you were going for a rustic or industrial look, I'd say go for it, but this is more finished looking to me.\n\nThis leaves us looking at nicer woods or high grade plywood with edge banding. You can find both of these options at big box stores, however the quality simply isn't what you'd find at a yard or specialty store. (Think lots of warping, wood that's been there for who knows how long, and a lack of knowledge from underpaid and under trained associates.) \n\nThe hardware, stain, sealer, and fasteners wouldn't be a terrible cost, probably around $50, but the lumber is going to sting. Figure out your plan - (btw, look on sites like Ana White for free plans that tells you how much of everything you need,) and take that list to the store and see what the cost is. Plan for waste, up your needed lumber, and see if you feel it's worth it. \n\n(Another option would be to find a table top on another old table and refinish it and just make the base. Craigslist, estate sales, thrift stores, etc.)\n"

Introduction Understanding the interactions between liquid crystal (LC) and a solid substrate is of clear applied interest, the vast majority of LC displays relying on control of interfaces. However this concerns also fundamental problems like wetting phenomena and all phenomena of orientation of soft matter bulk induced by the presence of an interface. In LCs at interfaces, the so-called easy axes correspond to the favoured orientations of the LC director close to the interface. If one easy axis only is defined for one given interface, the bulk director orients along or close to this axis [1]. It is well known that, in anchoring phenomena, two major effects compete to impose the anchoring directions of a liquid crystal, first, the interactions between molecules and the interface, second, the substrate roughness whose role has been analyzed by Berreman [2]. The influence of adsorbed molecular functional groups at the interface is most often dominant with, for example in carbon substrates, a main influence of unsaturated carbon bonds orientation at the interface [3]. In common LC displays, there is one unique easy axis, but modifications of surfaces have allowed for the discovery of promising new anchoring-related properties. For instance, the first anchoring bi-stability has been established on rough surfaces, associated with electric ordo-polarization [4] and the competition between a stabilizing short-range term and a destabilizing long-range term induced by an external field, can induce a continuous variation of anchoring orientation [5]. More recently, surfaces with several easy axes have been studied extensively. It has been shown that control of a continuous variation of director pretilt, obtained in several systems [6, 7], is associated with the presence of two different easy axes, one perpendicular to the substrate (homeotropic) and one planar [7, 8]. Similar models can explain the continuous evolution of anchoring between two planar orientations observed on some crystalline substrates [9]. However, in the same time, two easy axes can also lead to anchoring bi-stability [10, 11] or discontinuous transitions of anchoring [9], which is not compatible with the model established to interpret observed control of pretilt. In order to be able to predict if bi-stability or continuous combination of the two easy axes occurs for one given system, it becomes necessary to understand the microscopic origin of the easy axes."

I don't see how a bad smell could be an effective animal defense.\n\nRemember that most animals are much more dependent on smell than humans are.  What might be inadequate defense against humans would be a stronger deterrent to a predator - not to mention interfering with its ability to smell for some time afterwards.  \n\n&gt;Yes, it apparently can cause blindness, but goggles would solve that problem.\n\nOr vomiting, or (rarely) hemolytic anemia.\n\n&gt;It lasts a long time, but I don't have work for 4 days.\n\nDo you have any social engagements during that time?  Are you an extreme introvert?  Most people would rather not stay home alone for days on end.  But you will be persona non grata in most social situations.\nyogofoxy: Well, yes, it would be worse for animals - but I'm a human, so I don't think that would be a huge concern.\n\nHow does it caught anemia, or vomitting? I haven't heard of that.\n\nFor the next 4 days I mostly had planned on relaxing anyways, during a rare vacation from work - so with regards to that, I don't think that's a concern either. Besides, I could wash the smell off somehow, I would think.\nGnosticGnome: The vomiting is from the stench; the thiols can for some people cause hemolytic anemia due to oxidative stress\nyogofoxy: I've never actually seen or heard of anyone vomit from a bad smell alone, except in cartoons. Is that a real-life thing? I can't even see any examples of it online.\nGnosticGnome: I've seen it happen in real life.  Yes, it's a thing.  Presumably the evolutionary benefit would be that we avoid eating spoiled food even when we're hungry because the smell makes us nauseated, and throw up contaminated food we've just eaten once we receive that olfactory data that it's likely too spoiled.\n"

The linear mechanical properties of plastisol samples are then investigated over time using not only indentation tests, but also MR and ultrasound-elastography clinical protocols. These properties are compared to typical values reported for biological soft tissues and to the values found in the literature for PVCP gels.Results and conclusions: After a period of two weeks, the mechanical properties of the plastisol samples measured with indentation testing are stable for at least the following 4 weeks (end of follow-up period 43 days after gelation-fusion). Neither the mechanical nor the NMR properties of plastisol gels were found to be affected by the addition of cellulose as acoustic speckle. Mechanical properties of the proposed gels were successfully characterized by clinical, commercially-available MR Elastography and sonoelastography protocols. PVCP with a mass ratio of ultrasound speckle particles of 0.6% to 0.8% and a mass ratio between resin and plasticizer between 50 and 70% appears as a good TMP candidate that can be used with both MR and ultrasound-based elastography methods."

The idiots who remodeled my house before I bought it did a rush cut and run job (developer was in a rush to keep his head above water during the 2008 crash, he's in jail now, but that's a long story), didn't acclimate the wood, and then didn't even leave a gap.   It's a super old house and they knew removing the old baseboards in the hallway would damage the plaster wall with 500 layers of paint on them.  So they lucked out and the boards came up right to each edge in that hallway so they just laid it down right up to each ancient baseboard.  Didn't even nail some of them down (or at least sparsely).  I've redone most of the house but haven't gotten around to that hallway since the wood itself is reasonably good shape, but I can see it bulge in spots and it gets worse seasonally.\n\nNot a fake thing.\n"

GANs are a type of generative machine learning models that produce new data samples with the same characteristics as a training data distribution in an unsupervised way, avoiding data assumptions and human induced biases. In this work, we are exploring the use of GANs for synthetic financial scenarios generation. This pilot study is the result of a collaboration between Fujitsu and Advestis and it will be followed by a thorough exploration of the use cases that can benefit from the proposed solution. We propose a GANs-based algorithm that allows the replication of multivariate data representing several properties (including, but not limited to, price, market capitalization, ESG score, controversy score,. . .) of a set of stocks. This approach differs from examples in the financial literature, which are mainly focused on the reproduction of temporal asset price scenarios. We also propose several metrics to evaluate the quality of the data generated by the GANs. This approach is well fit for the generation of scenarios, the time direction simply arising as a subsequent (eventually conditioned) generation of data points drawn from the learned distribution. Our method will allow to simulate high dimensional scenarios (compared to $\\lesssim10$ features currently employed in most recent use cases) where network complexity is reduced thanks to a wisely performed feature engineering and selection. Complete results will be presented in a forthcoming study."

A first hypothesis emerges from this premonitory observation that it is not technology that justifies the gradual demobilization (or even demotivation) of local actors to establish forms of Francophone partnerships for training and research. Nor is it a question of political will to improve technological infrastructure in digital training and research. Almost all the interviews carried out within the framework of this mission demonstrated the convergence of views and ambitious attitudes expressed by three categories of actors encountered:- political actors met in the ministries of education of the three countries who are aware of the importance of digital education and the added value generated by technologies for education. Each of the three countries has a regulatory framework and national technological innovation projects for education and digital education;- public and private academic institutions which, through their rectors, presidents and technical and pedagogical leaders, demonstrate their profound convictions for digital education (for reasons of quality, competitiveness and economic interest). However, given the rather centralized governance model at state level, the majority of academic institutions in the three countries are often awaiting the promulgation of legal texts (decrees, charters, conventions, directives , Etc.) that enable them to act and adopt innovative solutions in teaching and research;- Teacher-researchers relatively little consulted in this expertise, but sufficiently engaged as actors on the ground to be able to predict their points of view with regard to the use of digital in their pedagogical and research activities. Teachers and researchers with relatively modest incomes would inevitably have a decisive role in any academic reform on the digital level if concrete mobilizing arguments could compensate for their shortfalls by joining digital training or development projects or programs."

These examples target one or several particular objects and use different types of equipment that can be expensive. These aspects can put off uninitiated archaeologists. So it would be appropriate to see if these techniques could be generalized to a whole class of geometrically simple and common artifacts, such as ceramics. From these observations, associated to ceramics specialists with fragments of broken ceramics, we aimed at arranging different tools and methods, including photogrammetry, to explore opportunities for a cheap and attainable reconstruction methodology and its possible applications. Our first objective was to establish a protocol for scanning fragments with photogrammetry, and for reconstruction of original ceramics.

        "text": " to propose a model whereby new species arise not by populations splitting into separate branches, but by small inbreeding groups \"budding\" from an ancestral stock. This would be driven by several advantages of inbreeding, and mainly by advantageous recessive phenotypes, which could only be retained in the context of inbreeding. Reproductive barriers would thus not arise as secondary consequences of divergent evolution in populations isolated from one another, but under the direct selective pressure of ancestral stocks. Many documented cases of speciation in natural populations appear to fit the model proposed, with more speciation occurring in populations with high inbreeding coefficients, and many recessive characters identified as central to the phenomenon of speciation, with these recessive mutations expected to be surrounded by patterns of limited genomic diversity. Conclusions: Whilst adaptive evolution would correspond to gains of function that would, most of the time, be dominant, this type of speciation by budding would thus be driven by mutations resulting in the advantageous loss of certain functions since recessive mutations very often correspond to the inactivation of a gene. A very important further advantage of inbreeding is that it reduces the accumulation of recessive mutations in genomes. A consequence of the model proposed is that the existence of species would correspond to a metastable equilibrium between inbreeding and outbreeding, with excessive inbreeding promoting speciation, and excessive outbreeding resulting in irreversible accumulation of recessive mutations that could ultimately only lead to extinction."

This standardized and repeatable method consists in a recording session of the ambient sound directly followed by an experiment using a calibrated white noise sound broadcast at different positions along a 100 m linear transect. We then used acoustic laws to reveal the basic physics behind sound propagation attenuation. 3. We demonstrate that habitat attenuation in two different kinds of forests can be modelled by an exponential decay law with a linear dependence on frequency and distance. We also report that habitat attenuation, as first approximation, can be summarized by a single value, the coefficient of attenuation of the habitat. 4. Finally, we show that the detection distance can be predicted knowing the contribution of each attenuation factor, the coefficient of attenuation of the habitat, the ambient sound pressure level and the amplitude and frequency bandwidth characteristics of the transmitted sound. We show that the detection 1 distance mostly depends on the ambient sound and may vary by a factor of up to 5 over the diel cycle and across seasons. These results reinforce the need to take into account the variation of the detection distance when performing passive acoustic surveys and producing reliable biodiversity indicators."
