Make the mount so it stands off the wall an inch or so and angle the led strip outward and back so it illuminates the WALL around the plaque.  That would draw attention to it but not make it an in-your-face light making it hard to look into.  Here is the wall effect I am thinking:\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/01/a4/a7/01a4a71296c19077fe300113f7fe0eb5.jpg\n\n\nAnother option is to edge light plexi.  You would put a plexiglas plate between the head and the wood plate and edge light the plexiglass.  The plexi could be routed (standard router) with a design or if you have a laser cutter, plexi is extremely easy to cut and etch, expecially with a CO2 laser.  Mine cuts very quickly and etches very well.  Here is an edge lit sign to get an idea:\nhttp://www.valleydesignsnd.com/catalog/images/products/ac10212015_2.jpg\n\nAnother option to look at is tossing the LED thing and looking at EL wire.  Its very flexible, easy to work with and isn't extremely intense like LED is.  Is more of a subtle but distinctive look.  Doesn't put out much light so won't do anything for lighting up your head.  But for eyecandy effects, its hard to discount.  Its soft and flexible enough to be woven into clothes and has been used in halloween costumes for quite a few years now.  Here is an example off google (not endorsing this site, just has a decent pic): \nhttps://glowproducts.com/media/catalog/product/cache/5/thumbnail/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/e/l/el_wire_kits_gp2.jpg\n\nYusunoha: Thank you for your reply and all the information. \nTo quickly summarize the project that I have in mind, I have a giraffe animal head that I want to put on a plaque, and make it look like the imguraffe. Imgur is about the color green, so I had the idea of adding LED's to the plague that you can set to green.\n\nThe effect what I'm trying to go after though is having the head be illuminated in a dark room. Having the back of the plague is an option I considered, but I wanted to focus the light on the head than rather on the plague. And by diffusing the light you will not be directly staring into the light.\n\nI had not considered the edge lit option, I'll take it into consideration, but I think it may be a step too far for me.\n"

We highlight in particular the work of Nicolas-Auguste Tissot (1824--1897), a French mathematician and geographer who (according to our knowledge) was the first to introduce the notion of a mapping which transforms infinitesimal circles into infinitesimal ellipses, studying parameters such as the ratio of the major to the minor axes of such an infinitesimal ellipse, its area divided by the area of the infinitesimal circle of which it is the image, and the inclination of its axis with respect to a fixed axis in the plane. We also give some information about the lives and works of Gr\\\"otzsch, Lavrentieff, Ahlfors and Teichm\\\"uller. The latter brought the theory of quasiconformal mappings to a high level of development. He used it in an essential way in his investigations of Riemann surfaces and their moduli and in function theory (in particular, in his work on the Bieberbach conjecture and the type problem). We survey in detail several of his results. We also discuss some aspects of his life and writings, explaining why his papers were not read and why some of his ideas are still unknown even to Teichm\\\"uller theorists. The final version of this paper will appear in the book \"Uniformization, Riemann-Hilbert Correspondence, Calabi-Yau Manifolds, and Picard-Fuchs Equations\" (ed. L. Ji and S.-T. Yau), International Press and Higher Education Press (2017)."

        "text": ". It is well established, for diverse species, that the spontaneous displacement of insects such as ants, on an horizontal planar surface, may be accurately mod-eled as a constant-speed diffusion random-walk [2-4]. We assume that a circle of radius R is drawn on the surface and we measure the average time that ants spend inside the circle when they enter it (see Fig. 1). The last assumption is that measurements are performed a long time after ants were dropped on the surface, so that the memory of their initial position is lost : this is enough to ensure that no specific direction is favored and therefore that when ants encounter the circle, their incident directions are distributed isotropically. Simple Monte Carlo simulations of such experiments (see Fig. 2) indicate without any doubt that the average encounter time (time between entry into the circle and first exit), for a fixed velocity, depends only of the circle radius. It is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion walk : the mean free path $\\lambda$ (average distance between two scattering events, i.e. between two direction-changes), and the single-scattering phase function p(u s , u i) (probability density function of the scattering direction u s for an incident direction u i). Furthermore, this average time scales as R/v, which means that the average trajectory-length < L > scales as R. The average trajectory-length would therefore be the same for different experiments with any insect species-or for any type of diffusive corpuscular motion. There are two reasons why this observation may initially sound counter-intuitive. The first reason is that the average length of diffusion trajectories between two points is known to scale approximately as d 2 /$\\lambda$ where d is the distance between the two points (1). For shorter mean (1)This scaling would be exact for an infinite domain in the limit d >> $\\lambda$ [5] c EDP Sciences"

You keep at it and see the progress, make changes on the way as you think fit (depends upon energy levels, strength in the gym etc). You can definitely build muscle over such a caloric surplus, but you've gotta track the intake.

For me personally this part confuses me a little because there's many takes on it. Lastly is 0.5-1.0 lb a week a reasonable amount of weight gain?\n\nI'll make sure to watch it, I think I plan on bulking a little more until June then doing a mini cut for 4-6 weeks. Would some cardio hurt btw? Or would the deficit be too big? Sorry for all these questions btw lol I am decently informed in calisthenics but not so much diet.\nBhav2112: Yes track macros, use apps like my fitness pal etc. The main aim of tracking those calories is to educate yourself, after tracking for a while the numbers will start coming to your head instantly and tracking won't be necessary after that. The weight range you've mentioned is an acceptable number. With lean bulking you might be gaining on the lower end though which is fine. \n\nCardio never hurts, keeps the heart healthy. You can try and do high intensity cardio. The deficit won't get too big. If you are weighing yourself each day, you'll see how much you are losing in a week. After you arrive at that number, you may cut or add calories or cardio as required. \n\nIt all sounds very daunting and it is in the beginning. After you've had some experience, all of this becomes easier. Track everything for a month and you'll have a lifetime of tracking experience.\n"

The paper presents a systematic review of existing implicit definitions of data, elaborating on the implications of these definitions and highlighting the ways in which metadata and computational technologies can restrict the interpretative potential of data. It sheds light on the gap between analogue or augmented digital practices and fully computational ones, and the strategies researchers have developed to deal with this gap.

Sub-second time variations were detected in both sources during both phases, with 0.2-0.3s a delay of the upper source with respect to the lower, suggesting superluminal velocities. This effect can be explained if the emission of the upper source was due to scattering of radiation from the source at the base of the surge. In addition, the radio emission showed signs of pulsations and spikes. We discuss possible emission mechanisms for the slow time variability component of the lower radio source. Gyrosynchrotron emission reproduced fairly well the characteristics of the observed total intensity spectrum at the start of the second phase of the event, but failed to reproduce the high degree of the observed circular polarization as well the spectra at other instances. On the other hand, type IV-like plasma emission from the fundamental could explain the high polarization and the fine structure in the dynamic spectrum; moreover, it gives projected radio source positions on the plane of the sky, as seen from STEREO-A, near the base of the surge. Taking everything into consideration, we suggest type IV-like plasma emission with a low intensity gyrosynchrotron component as the most plausible mechanism."

No big deal but a little time consuming. You're local hardware store / amazon will carry vinyl repair glue specifically for floating plank vinyl.\nLawyerStandard9368: Curious why you think they will separate on all 4 sides if removed. Are you saying that in order for the joint to remain locked it can only be put together once?\nGoArray: Basically, yeah. It can be reused, don't get me wrong, they just don't snap lock together as well the second time around.  \n\nThere's usually a tiny lip lock, about 1/16\" of material beveled to allow locking and prevent seperation, this almost always gets rounded / damaged when taking apart.  \n\nSome also have a small bead of adhesive that's single use.  \n\nThe flooring itself should still be good, but you'll need to take extra care to ensure they're locking in place the second time around, perhaps even gluing if the little lock tabs are no longer securing.\nLawyerStandard9368: Interesting. I do warranty repairs for a flooring installation company. Often times when I\u2019m fitting pieces I will engage sections of the planks to dry fit and mark for cuts. With certain, thinner lvps I\u2019ve noticed it is very easy to break tabs and bend the edge of the top layer but I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed the joints not remaining locked after disengaging and reengaging them. I wonder if it\u2019s just with certain products or if I\u2019ll notice these issues overtime. I guess glueing the planks that have been removed would be the safer route to go I would just add that you only need two or three small dabs of glue for the long edges of each plank. I wouldn\u2019t even glue the ends because if all edges are glued the ends can\u2019t separate. Only two or three small dabs of glue will be fine because the planks aren\u2019t going to separate in between glue spots, as that would require it to bend along it\u2019s width which ain\u2019t happenin. Glueing the whole edge seems like massive overkill and would make doing any future repairs a royal pita\nGoArray: Ther trick to what you're doing is not fully locking the planks while dry fitting, it's that last 1/32\" where they actually lock that's 'permanent'.  \n\nYou can do an experiment next time to check for weakening. Lock two sets of 2 pieces together, take one set apart, then put it back together. Try seperating both sets and note any difference.    \n\nEngineered wood is almost always an absolute fail, lvp \"lifeproof\" is hit or miss typically just a weaker lock, cheaper lvp the little raised lock tends to break off or start seperating.   \n\nAnd yeah, I was certainly advising overkill for OP, best to do so I imagine? In reality I tend to just carry a tube of superglue gel, 3 or 4 dots in any edges I'm resetting.\nLawyerStandard9368: Better safe than sorry for sure. Well that\u2019s good to know!

Inthe latter case, we prove that the $\\omega$-regular language is robust againstsmall perturbations of the transition weights. We next consider automata with transition weights $0$ or $1$ and show thatthey are as expressive as general weighted automata in the limit-average case,but not in the discounted-sum case. Third, for quantitative languages $L_1$ and~$L_2$, we consider the operations$\\max(L_1,L_2)$, $\\min(L_1,L_2)$, and $1-L_1$, which generalize the booleanoperations on languages, as well as the sum $L_1 + L_2$. We establish theclosure properties of all classes of quantitative languages with respect tothese four operations.$ or $ and show that they are as expressive as general weighted automata in the limit-average case, but not in the discounted-sum case.

Balancing the two sources of information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally or globally. In both contexts, supervised and un-supervised, data can be relational (augmented with one or several global graphs) as described above, or graph valued. In this latter case, each object of interest is given as a full graph (possibly completed by other characteristics). In this context, natural tasks include graph clustering (as in producing clusters of graphs rather than clusters of nodes in a single graph), graph classification, etc. 1 Real networks One of the first practical studies on graphs can be dated back to the original work of Moreno [51] in the 30s. Since then, there has been a growing interest in graph analysis associated with strong developments in the modelling and the processing of these data. Graphs are now used in many scientific fields. In Biology [54, 2, 7], for instance, metabolic networks can describe pathways of biochemical reactions [41], while in social sciences networks are used to represent relation ties between actors [66, 56, 36, 34]. Other examples include powergrids [71] and the web [75]. Recently, networks have also been considered in other areas such as geography [22] and history [59, 39]. In machine learning, networks are seen as powerful tools to model problems in order to extract information from data and for prediction purposes. This is the object of this paper. For more complete surveys, we refer to [28, 62, 49, 45]. In this section, we introduce notations and highlight properties shared by most real networks. In Section 2, we then consider methods aiming at extracting information from a unique network. We will particularly focus on clustering methods where the goal is to find clusters of vertices.

Another major finding of this study is that all GRN mutations may not have the same impact on progranulin protein synthesis. A hypomorphic effect of some mutations is supported by the presence of residual levels of plasma progranulin and low levels of normal transcript detected in one case with a homozygous splice-site mutation and late onset frontotemporal dementia. This is a new critical finding that must be considered in therapeutic trials based on replacement strategies. The first neuropathological study in a homozygous carrier provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of the disease. Hallmarks of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were present. The absence of TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions markedly differs from observations of heterozygous mutations, suggesting a pathological shift between lysosomal and TDP-43 pathologies depending on the mono or bi-allelic status. An intriguing observation was the loss of normal TDP-43 staining in the nucleus of some neurons, which could be the first stage of the TDP-43 pathological process preceding the formation of typical cytoplasmic inclusions. Finally, this study has important implications for genetic counselling and molecular diagnosis. Semi-dominant inheritance of GRN mutations implies that specific genetic counseling should be delivered to children and parents of CLN11 patients, as they are heterozygous carriers with a high risk of developing dementia. More broadly, this study illustrates the fact that genetic variants can lead to different phenotypes according to their mono- or bi-allelic state, which is a challenge for genetic diagnosis."

A few years later, a \" deformation theory of geometric structures \" on manifolds of dimension n was introduced and one may quote riemannian, symplectic or complex analytic structures. Though often conjectured, the link between the two approaches has never been exhibited and the aim of this paper is to provide the solution of this problem by new methods. The key tool is made by the \" Vessiot structure equations \" (1903) for Lie groups or Lie pseudogroups of transformations, which, contrary to the \" Cartan structure equations \", are still unknown today and contain \" structure constants \" which, like in the case of constant riemannian curvature, have in general nothing to do with any Lie algebra. The main idea is then to introduce the purely differential Janet sequence $0 \\rightarrow \\Theta \\rightarrow T \\rightarrow F_0 \\rightarrow F_1 \\rightarrow ... \\rightarrow F_n \\rightarrow 0$ as a resolution of the sheaf $\\Theta \\subset T$ of infinitesimal transformations and to induce a purely algebraic \" deformation sequence \" with finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps, even if $\\Theta$ is infinite dimensional. The infinitesimal equivalence problem for geometric structures has to do with the local exactness at $ F_0 $ of the Janet sequence while the deformation problem for algebraic structures has to do with the exactness of the deformation sequence at the invariant sections of $F_1 $, that is ONE STEP FURTHER ON in the sequence and this unexpected result explains why the many tentatives previously quoted have not been successful. Finally, we emphasize through examples the part that could be played by computer algebra in any explicit computation."

The running time of this algorithm is difficult to analyse in general, but we calculate it for several examples. In the case where $p$ is uniform over a finite set of boxes, then the algorithm just checks boxes uniformly at random among all non-checked boxes and is essentially $2$ times worse than the coordinating algorithm.We also show simple algorithms for Pareto distributions over $M$ boxes.

I haven't purchased one yet, but I'm wondering if it is sufficient. Some videos I've seen on youtube suggest using a rototiller, but the examples I've seen didn't talk about being able to use it on stones. Will the rocks damage the tiller?  Would the smaller stones just fly everywhere? Also, I heard that doing so brings about more weeds as it brings seeds to the surface. \n\nAn excavator is also out of the question simply because there is no way to drive one into the area... yet. I can accept it if the answer is to just slowly comb through the area with the bar, but of course I should explore other options. \n\nRegarding the weeds, I'm also hesitant to resort to weed-killers because of wildlife that roams through. \n\n\nHere are a couple [photos](http://imgur.com/a/n5Bf5) of what the ground looks like.\nLukeDemeo: Not really sure if this will work but I'll give my suggestion anyways, I would suggest going at it with a pick axe to loosen up the soil and rock and then scooping up the loose soil with a shovel to sift it.\nthe_perkolator: This.  Pretty much anything that will pre-break up the dirt so the rock chunks move when your shovel tries to penetrate - a pick axe, breaker bar, roto tiller, etc. even simply softening the dirt with water can help.  The roto tiller is probably the easiest since it involves the least elbow grease, but it can skip and jump around when you hit a larger stone that won't pass through the blades or move away when broken free.\n\nOnce you get a section loose, shovel it out and screen your dirt to remove the rocks.  A simple wood frame with hardware cloth is all you need.  No matter what, if you're agitating the soil the weeds will follow.\n\nGood luck, sounds like you've got quite a project\nIchi-Guren: Yeah I'm both excited at the possibilities but dreading the cost of it all. \n\nThe stone in the third photo is about 2/3 the size of my head. Will those damage a tiller or will the blades simply jam/skip? That's what I'm worried about. Their presence is too uniform throughout the soil to avoid and some are hidden by dirt. I guess hopefully I'm meticulous enough with the pick/bar to find them all?  \nthe_perkolator: In my experience the tiller will skip when they hit one of those rocks, sometimes it'll pull them up and even crush them depending on the tiller and type of rock.  You're likely gonna have to also use a breaker bar or pick axe to dislodge some of these.  Luckily the tiller will make quick work of loosening the areas without big rocks, so you'll be able to more easily spot the ones you need to go back in by hand\n\nEither way, your dirt does look more rocky than anything, in order to get grass to grow you'd likely have to top it off new new soil - so just that will eliminate rocks in the top few inches.  Don't forget to dig trenches to install irrigation for watering it easier, hopefully no boulders deeper under the top :)\n"

The Rideal\u2013Walker test was widely used, but the test conditions chosen were unrealistic, and impossibly high values for the coefficient were claimed by disinfectant manufacturers. Distinguished bacteriologist Sir Ashley Miles, reviewing the subject, described the test as \"...at best a grossly over-simplified answer to a difficult problem and, at worst little short of bacteriological prostitution\".  Modifications were made by Dame Harriette Chick and Sir Charles James Martin in 1908. They used more realistic conditions, including 3% sterile faeces to mimic the conditions in which many disinfectants were used. The Chick\u2013Martin test was then widely used until replaced by more suitable tests not reliant on phenol and reflecting the conditions  in which modern disinfectants are used.\nCalculations by Harriette Chick showed that the killing of bacteria by disinfectants followed first order kinetics. So, the bactericidal activity of a particular disinfectant at a given concentration can be expressed as a constant (k) calculated by employing the formula k = N/C\u00b7T where N is the number of surviving cells, C is the concentration of agent applied and T is the time for which the agent is applied, so k is inversely proportional to dose (C\u00b7T is collectively called dose). \nOne way to compare disinfectants is to compare how well they do against a known disinfectant and rate them accordingly using the Phenol coefficient. The disinfectant to be tested is compared with phenol on a standard microbe (usually Salmonella typhi or Staphylococcus aureus). Disinfectants that are more effective than phenol have a coefficient greater than 1; those that are less effective have a coefficient less than 1."

Knowledge of the distance and the local dust extinction enables comparison of the afterglows of LAT-detected GRBs with the general sample.

The afterglows of long bursts exhibit power-law decay indices alpha from less than 1 to ~2.3 and spectral indices (beta) values from 0.65 to ~1.2 which are fairly standard for GRB afterglows. Constraints are placed on the jet half opening angles of less than 2.1 deg to greater than 6.4 deg which allows limits to be placed on the beaming corrected energies. These range from less than 5x10^50 erg to the one of the highest values ever recorded, greater than 2.2x10^52 erg for GRB090902B, and are not consistent with a standard candle. The extremely energetic long Fermi bursts have optical afterglows which lie in the top half of the brightness distribution of all optical afterglows detected in the Swift era or even in the top 5% if incompleteness is considered. The properties of the host galaxies of these LAT detected bursts in terms of extinction, star formation rates and masses do not appear to differ from previous samples."

We show that the long-time behavior of this system is the result of a delicate interplay between $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ and $b$, in contrast to systems where the diffusion function is subquadratic. In particular, let $\\hat{a}(i,j)={1/2}[a(i,j)+a(j,i)]$, $i,j\\in \\mathbb{Z}^d$, denote the symmetrized transition kernel. We show that: (A) If $\\hat{a}(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is recurrent, then for any $b>0$ the system locally dies out. (B) If $\\hat{a}(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is transient, then there exist $b_*\\geq b_2>0$ such that: (B1)d The system converges to an equilibrium $\\nu_{\\Theta}$ (with mean $\\Theta$) if $0<b<b_*$. (B2) The system locally dies out if $b>b_*$. (B3) $\\nu_{\\Theta}$ has a finite 2nd moment if and only if $0<b<b_2$. (B4) The 2nd moment diverges exponentially fast if and only if $b>b_2$. The equilibrium $\\nu_{\\Theta}$ is shown to be associated and mixing for all $0<b<b_*$. We argue in favor of the conjecture that $b_*>b_2$. We further conjecture that the system locally dies out at $b=b_*$. For the case where $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is symmetric and transient we further show that: (C) There exists a sequence $b_2\\geq b_3\\geq b_4\\geq ... >0$ such that: (C1) $\\nu_{\\Theta}$ has a finite $m$th moment if and only if $0<b<b_m$. (C2) The $m$th moment diverges exponentially fast if and only if $b>b_m$. (C3) $b_2\\leq (m-1)b_m<2$. uad(C4) $\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}(m-1)b_m=c=\\sup_{m\\geq 2}(m-1)b_m$. The proof of these results is based on self-duality and on a representation formula through which the moments of the components are related to exponential moments of the collision local time of random walks. Via large deviation theory, the latter lead to variational expressions for $b_*$ and the $b_m$'s, from which sharp bounds are deduced. The critical value $b_*$ arises from a stochastic representation of the Palm distribution of the system. The special case where $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is simple random walk is commonly referred to as the parabolic Anderson model with Brownian noise. This case was studied in the memoir by Carmona and Molchanov [Parabolic Anderson Problem and Intermittency (1994) Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI], where part of our results were already established."

By assuming that the artifacts are on the ground, they are detected using a Top-Hat of the hole filling algorithm of range images. Then, several features are extracted from the detected connected components and a stepwise forward variable/model selection by using the Wilk's Lambda criterion is performed.

Either someone gives them to me or I manage to fix what I've got, else I've got nothing to work with.  :/\n\nIf I pry the grill off without damaging it, would normal superglue be good enough to put them back on so they don't look like crap?\njonvon65: Ahh, I see. The issue isn't getting the speakers open as much as fixing the blown drivers themselves. I haven't heard many success stories of blown drivers being restored. The only spare speakers I have are little mid rangers from my car (one of them pops when turned too loud but otherwise works fine). I would send them to you but they're 2.75 inches in diameter which is a lot smaller than the ones you have. Normal superglue probably wouldn't adhere that well to the front grills because it's a little too thin. Thicker glue like hot glue or gorilla glue would be better for this situation.\n2LateImDead: I might be able to get some Gorilla glue if it's even fixable.  Probably isn't though, like you said.  Thanks for the offer of those speakers from your car.  I'm pretty sure they're actually about the size of these ones - I shone a light through the mesh to look inside and these things are like 90% casing, the speaker inside is fairly small.  I don't have any exact measurements, though.\n\nDo you have an estimate of how much it'd cost to mail them?  I live in Virginia.  I don't really have any money because my job sucks and I'm going through college and supporting myself, but I could skip paying my phone bill this month to cover shipping costs, potentially.  But I can't imagine they'd be huge, even shipping from Asia is normally no more than $10, if it's something reasonably small.\njonvon65: Honestly, don't worry about the shipping, I've got you covered. I'm testing them out right now and they're not half bad. Also they're just bare speakers and I'd like to put them in an enclosure of some sort before I ship them. What would you be hooking them up to?\n2LateImDead: I've got an old Sony amplifier that uses the basic black and red speaker wires to hook things up.  It's also got RCA (yellow-white-red, minus the yellow since it's just audio) outputs and inputs.  I've got an AUX-RCA adapter to input sound.  I've never used the RCA outputs but I'm under the impression that they'd work the same, so whatever is easiest for you.\n\nThanks a bunch, by the way.  I've been really stressed about not having any speakers.  I'll still need to find more, but getting back 2 when I lost 4 cuts the loss in half, which is a big help.  And even 2 is enough to get back to practicing and recording.  :)\n\nI'll send you a PM with my address.\njonvon65: Ahh ok, good, that makes it easy then! Of course, just letting you know beforehand that these speakers are good quality but they are rather small, you won't be pissing off the neighbors with them. That being said, just don't turn them up too loud and you should be fine. I'll start on building the enclosures tomorrow and hopefully I can get them shipped out to you sometime this week. You're welcome!\n"

All these methods require to compute second derivatives of the complete data log-likelihood which leads to some disadvantages from a computational point of view. In this paper, we present a new approach to estimate the FIM in latent variable model. The advantage of our method is that only the first derivatives of the log-likelihood is needed, contrary to other approaches based on the observed FIM. Indeed we consider the empirical estimate of the covariance matrix of the score. We prove that this estimate of the Fisher information matrix is unbiased, consistent and asymptotically Gaussian. Moreover we highlight that none of both estimates is better than the other in terms of asymptotic covariance matrix. When the proposed estimate can not be directly analytically evaluated, we present a stochastic approximation estimation algorithm to compute it. This algorithm provides this estimate of the FIM as a by-product of the parameter estimates. We emphasize that the proposed algorithm only requires to compute the first derivatives of the complete data log-likelihood with respect to the parameters. We prove that the estimation algorithm is consistent and asymptotically Gaussian when the number of iterations goes to infinity. We evaluate the finite sample size properties of the proposed estimate and of the observed FIM through simulation studies in linear mixed effects models and mixture models. We also investigate the convergence properties of the estimation algorithm in non linear mixed effects models. We compare the performances of the proposed algorithm to those of other existing methods."

We also present detectability confidence limits from the radial-velocity data sets and show how these can be used to gain a better understanding of these systems when combined with the imaging data. For HD32778 and HD91204 the detectabilities help little in constraining the companion and hence almost all our knowledge is drawn from the SDI images. Therefore, we can say that these stars do not host cool methane objects, out to on-sky separations of ~2'', with contrasts less than 10-11 magnitudes. However, for HD25874, HD120780 and HD145825, the contrasts and detectabilities can rule out a number of possible solutions, particularly at low angular separations, and for the best case, down to strong methane masses of 40MJ at 1'' separation. The contrast curves constructed for these five stars show 5 sigma contrasts (Delta F1) of ~9.2-11.5 magnitudes at separations of >/=0.6'', which correspond to contrasts of ~9.7-12.0 magnitudes for companions of mid-T spectral type. Such limits allow us to reach down to 40MJ around fairly old field dwarfs that typically constitute high precision radial-velocity programs. Finally, the analysis performed here can serve as a template for future projects that will employ extreme-AO systems to directly image planets already indirectly discovered by the radial-velocity method."

To deconvolve them from the hyperfine structure and to separate the blend that is due to various velocity components on the sightline, we fit model spectra consisting of an appropriate number of Gaussian profiles using a method combining simulated annealing with downhill simplex minimization. Together with HF and/or CH as a surrogate for H2, and HI $\\lambda$21 cm data, the molecular hydrogen fraction f^N\\_H2 = N(H 2)/(N(H) + 2N(H 2)) can be determined. We then investigated abundance ratios as a function of f^N\\_H2. Results. The column density of OI is correlated at a high significance with the amount of available molecular and atomic hydrogen, with an atomic oxygen abundance of $3 \\times 10 ^{-4}$ relative to H nuclei. While the velocities of the absorption features of OH and OH+ are loosely correlated and reflect the spiral arm crossings on the sightline, upon closer inspection they display an anticorrespondence. The arm-to-interarm density contrast is found to be higher in OH than in OH+. While both species can coexist, with a higher abundance in OH than in OH+, the latter is found less frequently in absence of OH than the other way around, which is a direct consequence of the rapid destruction of OH+ by dissociative recombination when not enough H2 is available. This conjecture has been substantiated by a comparison between the OH/OH+ ratio with f^N\\_H2, showing a clear correlation. The hydrogen abstraction reaction chain OH+ (H2,H) H2O+ (H2,H)H3O+ is confirmed as the pathway for the production of OH and H 2 O. Our estimate of the branching ratio of the dissociative recombination of H3O+ to OH and H2O is confined within the interval of 84 to 91%, which matches laboratory measurements (74 to 83%). -- A correlation between the linewidths and column densities of OH+ features is found to be significant with a false-alarm probability below 5%. Such a correlation is predicted by models of interstellar MHD turbulence. For OH the same correlation is found to be insignificant because there are more narrow absorption features. Conclusions. While it is difficult to assess the contributions of warm neutral-neutral chemistry to the observed abundances, it seems fair to conclude that the predictions of cold ion-neutral chemistry match the abundance patterns we observed."

In fact, it is usually on a dedicated circuit which is code.\nghostfacr: This is correct and proper.  There is a junction box at the bottom front of like, every dishwasher.\ndfoley1313: That isn't code. Code is having a GFCI with dedicated circuit. You can use a pig tail to connect to the outlet under the sink, but yes you can connect hardwired. But again why do that, it is not a code issue and it is more of a pain in the ass to do so. Also Norther Cali \ngottapoop: Code in Canada doesn't require GFCI. Most dishwashers are hardwired here so you'd have to buy an expensive GFCI breaker. You sure about that code? Our codes are very similar\ndfoley1313: Yes gfci breaker is needed sorry forgot to put \"breaker\" in.  We always run 12/3 one goes to the top which stays hot then we break the tab run the other hot to the switch back to the bottom outlet and you have a outlet that has both a 20amp circuit. There is no problem doing a pig tail on a appliance and plugging it into a outlet instead of just hardwiring it to the device. Again it is a little extra work but it makes installing it easier and is code. I have done a lot of remodels of kitchens and inspectors ALWAYS check for this. \ngottapoop: Ya I just did a little googling and saw that our codes are definitely different for dishwashers. We don't even have anything relating to specifically to dishwashers just that they are a known motor and heating load so they have to be on their own circuit. Most are hardwired luckily because if you put them on a receptacle they would have to be on an AFCI due to new code rules requiring all receptacles unless otherwise stated needing to be AFCI protected.\n\nDoes the receptacle you install for the dishwasher go on the counter top and you run the power cable up or do you install under the kitchen sink and do the split receptacle thing for future additions like garberators or undercab lighting?\ndfoley1313: Goes under the cabinet usually in the sink base. Never thought of using it for under cab lighting usually just the disposal. Using the 12/3 and the split receptacle is the easiest way to do it. Now most of the times we don't even run a switch for the garbage disposal we just have them both hot but on different home runs, but use a air gap switch for the garbage disposal mounted on the sink. \n"

A specific feature of MECE formulations is that forward and adjoint solutions are governed by a fully coupled system, whose mathematical properties play a fundamental role in the qualitative and computational aspects of MECE minimization. We prove that this system has a unique and stable solution at any frequency, provided data is abundant enough (in a sense made precise therein) to at least compensate for any missing information on BCs. As a result, our formulation leads in such situations to a well-defined solution even though the relevant forward problem is not \\emph{a priori} clearly defined. This result has practical implications such as applicability of MECE to partial interior data (with important practical applications including ultrasound elastography), convergence of finite element discretizations and differentiability of the reduced MECE functional. In addition, we establish that usual least squares and pure ECE formulations are limiting cases of MECE formulations for small and large values of $\\kappa$, respectively. For the latter case, which corresponds to exact enforcement of kinematic data, we furthermore show that the reduced MECE Hessian is asymptotically positive for any parameter perturbation supported on the measurement region, thereby corroborating existing computational evidence on convexity improvement brought by MECE functionals. Finally, numerical studies that support and illustrate our theoretical findings, including a parameter reconstruction example using interior data, are presented."

We develop a method to estimate the causal effect of a treatment using an IV when there are nonignorable missing covariates as in our data, where we allow the missingness to depend on the fully observed outcome as well as the partially observed compliance class, which is a proxy for the unmeasured risk of complications. A simulation study shows that under our nonignorable missingness assumption, the commonly used estimation methods, complete-case analysis and multiple imputation by chained equations assuming missingness at random, provide biased estimates, while our method provides approximately unbiased estimates. We apply our method to the NICU study and find evidence that high-level NICUs significantly reduce deaths for babies of small gestational age, whereas for almost mature babies like 37 weeks, the level of NICUs makes little difference. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the sensitivity of our conclusions to key assumptions about the missing covariates.

It\u2019s always me making the plans.\u2026.we have new acquaintances tell us they want to hangout all the time but it never ends up happening\u2026we just continue on with our lives like the conversation never happened. It comes to a point where I feel awkward because I\u2019ve asked someone to hangout three times and it has fell through every time\u2026is it me? Am I bipolar? Do I judge my \u201cfriends\u201d too much? I\u2019ve never not had any friends but right now I just don\u2019t know if my friendships are healthy and genuine. I\u2019d love some positive help if anyone has any. Thanks in advance.\nFL-Irish: Re: the old friends, the whole hard drugs/alcoholic scene are pretty toxic in general, and extremely bad for young families, so if they're heading in that direction you need to REALLY limit how often you see these friends. (as you have with the one who's on drugs) Maybe be there for them in a pinch, but it doesn't even sound like you're enjoying hanging out with the alcoholic one. I don't think you're judging them as human beings. I think you're just protecting your normal life from stuff that has the potential to drag you down. \n\nSo moving on, it's hard to assess your situation. You say a few things have fallen through -- that's pretty common in the adult world, honestly, where everyone is busy with life. So, to go from that to a possible idea of being \"bipolar?\" That's quite the jump! Do you have any reason to suspect mental health issues? If so, it might be worth making a one-off appointment with a counselor just to discuss that. Anyway, hard to judge from what you've said. \n\nSo I'd continue to reach out to the acquaintances. Something like, \"Hey, the wife and I are considering doing X this weekend. Any chance you guys would like to join us?\"\n\nIf the answer is they can't, then just say, \"No problem, maybe some other time!\" Keep the energy and enthusiasm level high. You don't want to be giving off negative or disappointed vibes. Check in by text at least once a week.\n\nAt the same, don't invest all your eggs in this one social basket. If there are other couples who have potential, make it a habit to reach out and mention potential things you could do together. A picnic. A show. A barbecue. Go out for dinner. A movie. A farmers market. Go to the gym or the dog park. Hit a garage sale. \n\nIt's easier to make friends when you've got more than one thing going on, and you can issue casual invitations that don't seem high pressure. \"Oh, we're doing this if you're interested. Let us know!\"\n\nDon't get discouraged. I think you're on the right track. Good luck!\nHighlightSame7499: Thank you soooo much for this. I really needed it. It definitely helped me relieve some anxiety/stress with my situation and was very enjoyable to read. I\u2019m going to keep trying because I do want quality friends in my life.

Good luck choosing.\nBandatandWarrior: Do you mind if I ask why you wouldn't recommend anything by Dragon Door? I started using Convict Conditioning a month and a half ago and I'm seeing benefits. That said, I'm not the most athletic. I drank and smoked for years, so I'm gradually getting into body weight fitness. I'm genuinely curious though, as I've been doing it for such a short amount of time. I was going to supplement CC with the naked warrior as I heard good stuff. Any reasons why? I don't want to waste my money on an inferior product.\n\nThanks.\nJackofMA: If you choose to go Dragondoor, make sure you look at the Kindle versions on Amazon- not the PDF versions on the Dragondoor site. These are substantially cheaper than what is offered on the Dragondoor website for the paperback and for the Dragondoor PDF version. \n\nIn general, people are down on DD products because they are expensive with a lot of fluff. Full size pictures of one exercise when a smaller one would do. Huge margins and large type.\n\nThat being said- Naked Warrior is different from CC and may not offer what you are looking for. It focuses on techniques for tension to help you do one arm pushup and the pistol. Shows some progressions, but these boil down to manipulating height to make exercise easier. NW might help at the upper progressions of CC.\n\nWhether or not you get NW, do a search for Naked Warrior Bonus Material. One free pdf that comes up is for hanging leg raises. Pretty sure there is another one too. These are offered through the DD website, so it's not like you're downloading from some pirate site.\nBandatandWarrior: Thanks very much for the advice sir.\nAshamed to admit it but a month and a half in and I'm still on step one of the exercises. Since I turned 19 I let my fitness deteriorate badly. Only starting to get into it now as an outlet for my anxiety. Drives me crazy though because I boxed from 16 - 19 at an amateur level and used to be super fit. Anyway, thank you very much for taking time out of your day to comment. Have a good one.\n"

The series comprises Confessions of a Window Cleaner (directed by Val Guest, 1974), Confessions of a Pop Performer (1975), Confessions of a Driving Instructor (1976) and lastly Confessions from a Holiday Camp (1977). The Confessions series put Smith and Cohen in direct competition with the Carry On series of films. \"Things have changed since the Carry-Ons\" Smith remarked to Films Illustrated in September 1975: \"Humour is more sophisticated, people are more aware. Not that I'm running down the Carry-Ons for one moment. They're one of my favourite types of film, and always have been. But maybe they're a little dated now.\"A commercial, but diverse, filmmaker, Smith's other work from this period included producing the glam rock extravaganza Never Too Young to Rock (1976), the documentary  The Importance of Being Dublin (1974) and the third film  adaptation of The Thirty-Nine Steps (1978). Plans for a 1978 film adaptation of Dennis Potter's Pennies from Heaven (meant to have been produced by Smith for Norfolk International Productions) did not come to fruition, however, nor did plans to make a fifth Confessions film \u2018Confessions from a Haunted House\u2019 in 1978.\nSmith began turning more to producing for television, including the well-remembered Shillingbury Tales (1980), working in the field until the late 1990s.

I'm gonna start the beginner workout today, and I'm just wondering. Thank you!\nColoredMarxers: Realistically, I would say 2-3 weeks in was when I began to notice some major changes.

If you are serious about training and eat accordingly you will notice measurable results (ie you can do 1-2 more pushups or whatever) in maybe 2 weeks. And if you say start eating properly and exercise then your muscle may store more water and whatnot. So you may have a quick antithetical result as well.\nHowever if you have more bodyfat initially, then your visual results may come a bit later.\nlegatostaccato: yeah that's fair. i'm fairly lean now, though dreading going back to a skinny-fat \"look\", hehe. hopefully bulk will go well in a week or two when i start. got a clean diet at least.\n"

The rate of exchange between the atomic levels is proportional to the intensity of the laser field. The whole system is the physically natural nonlinear model. In order to provide an important and explicit example, we completely analyze the specific (two dimensional) Transverse Magnetic case, for which formulae turn out to be simpler.

A 3-D non-linear constitutive relation for the soil is implemented in the framework of the Finite Element Method in the time domain. The complex rheology of soils is modelled by mean of a multisurface cyclic plasticity model of the Masing-Prandtl-Ishlinskii-Iwan type. The great advantage of this choice is that the only data needed to describe the model is the modulus reduction curve. A parametric study is carried out to characterize the changes in the seismic motion of the surficial layers due to both incident wavefield properties and soil non-linearities. The numerical simulations show a seismic response depending on several parameters such as polarization of seismic waves, material elastic and dynamic properties, as well as on the impedance contrast between layers and frequency content and oscillatory character of the input motion. The 3-D loading path due to the 3C-polarization leads to multi-axial stress interaction that reduces soil strength and increases non-linear effects. The non-linear behaviour of the soil may have beneficial or detrimental effects on the seismic response at the free surface, depending on the energy dissipation rate. Free surface time histories, stress-strain hysteresis loops and in-depth profiles of octahedral stress and strain are estimated for each soil column. The combination of three separate 1D-1C non-linear analyses is compared to the proposed 1D-3C approach, evidencing the influence of the 3C-polarization and the 3-D loading path on strong seismic motions."

The grounding and the confidence in these results comes from the fact that we have performed our experiments on 32'058'823 lines of Python code, which is by far the largest test set for a freely available Python parser. We have also designed the experiment in such a way that it aligned with prior research on design defect detection in Java in order to ease the comparison if we treat our own actions as a replication.

Then I can incorporate Front lever holds further into my workout to make them harder cause One leg out 1 leg ADV tuck has gotten kinda easy, so i can make it harder, maybe some short straddle holds.\n\nI posted a bit more in climbharder recently on OAC training.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/75si0i/one_arm_pull_strength_progressions/do8n3gs/\n\nBasically, negatives and/or pulley assisted OAC concentrics are the best. I personally like negatives and those I've coached tend to have the best results with them, but assisted is solid as well. Some supplemental work is necessary for certain people.\nongew: Steve, are the lower numbers (70%) correlated to lighter/shorter people, while the higher numbers (90%) are correlated to the 6footers?\neshlow: No. It just depends how much someone has practiced weighted pullups and how much they have practiced OAC/OAP movements.\n\nIf you practice mostly weighted pullups with little practice to OAC you'll probably be closer to 95%. If you mostly practice OAC without much practice for weighted pullups, you'll be on the lower range.\nongew: Thanks, Steven.\n"

To realize this aim, we leverage the exploration-explanation paradigm of human-data interaction to let human stakeholders explore subsets and groupings of complex multi-attribute ranking data using visual explanations of model fit and attribute influence on rankings. We realize this explanation paradigm for transparent ranking interpretation in TRIVEA, a visual analytic system that is fueled by: i) visualizations of model fit derived from algorithmic rankers that learn the associations between attributes and rankings from available data and ii) visual explanations derived from XAI methods that help abstract important patterns, like, the relative influence of attributes in different ranking ranges. Using TRIVEA, end users not trained in data science have the agency to transparently reason about the global and local behavior of the rankings without the need to open black-box ranking models and develop confidence in the resulting attribute-based inferences. We demonstrate the efficacy of TRIVEA using multiple usage scenarios and subjective feedback from researchers with diverse domain expertise.

No barber uses an electric razor, at that point there's no point in getting the license. You also can't use electric clippers with kids with autism at first.\nShellphon3: Its true i am confusing them, why cant you use clippers on a kid with autism though?  They probably wont like the sound but they wouldnt get hurt.\nChaotross: Kids with autism don't simply \"not like sounds\". They get sensory overload very easily and can get themselves hurt badly from their reactions.\nShellphon3: Unless you provide some specifics,  all i see is you placing more emphasis on the same thing i said.\nChaotross: Except I countered what you said, saying they would in fact get hurt. Autistic children can have a complete breakdown from certain sensory input, a common one is irritating buzzing noises and the feeling of clippers over the head. Autism is a spectrum of symptoms, I can't say one specific reaction or symptom every child with autism will have. Look up some information yourself, man.\nShellphon3: If you want to posit that children will be hurt by clippers cite an instance of something like that happening, I dont know how you think the burden lies on me to fact check you.\nChaotross: Because you claimed you could cut anyone's hair out of nowhere with zero issue without any training even as a barber. I am countering your claim, the burden of proof is on you. You're being willfully ignorant.\n\nhowever, [here](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-39502366) is a similar article where a child had to be physically restrained while screaming before he found a barber that works with autistic and terminally ill children. If he wasn't physically restrained he would've injured himself.\nShellphon3: Clippers wont cut a kid,  and outside of kids who fall out of chairs I don't see how the distress of a haircut will cause physical harm. Tue article you linked makes the point that the kids are disruptive to business in barber shops, which is much more compelling than the notion that clippers will harm kids.\nChaotross: When did I *ever* say the clippers would cut them? The answer is never. The kid would hurt himself trying to fight out of being restrained. Kids falling out of chairs is *exactly* the issue, along with possibly causing injury to themselves if they hit themselves with their reaction. Have some basic reading comprehension, please.\nShellphon3: It was perfectly clear that I was referring to children not being hurt by clippers and safety scissors,  please refer to my initial post.\n"

Make the mount so it stands off the wall an inch or so and angle the led strip outward and back so it illuminates the WALL around the plaque.  That would draw attention to it but not make it an in-your-face light making it hard to look into.  Here is the wall effect I am thinking:\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/01/a4/a7/01a4a71296c19077fe300113f7fe0eb5.jpg\n\n\nAnother option is to edge light plexi.  You would put a plexiglas plate between the head and the wood plate and edge light the plexiglass.  The plexi could be routed (standard router) with a design or if you have a laser cutter, plexi is extremely easy to cut and etch, expecially with a CO2 laser.  Mine cuts very quickly and etches very well.  Here is an edge lit sign to get an idea:\nhttp://www.valleydesignsnd.com/catalog/images/products/ac10212015_2.jpg\n\nAnother option to look at is tossing the LED thing and looking at EL wire.  Its very flexible, easy to work with and isn't extremely intense like LED is.  Is more of a subtle but distinctive look.  Doesn't put out much light so won't do anything for lighting up your head.  But for eyecandy effects, its hard to discount.  Its soft and flexible enough to be woven into clothes and has been used in halloween costumes for quite a few years now.  Here is an example off google (not endorsing this site, just has a decent pic): \nhttps://glowproducts.com/media/catalog/product/cache/5/thumbnail/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/e/l/el_wire_kits_gp2.jpg\n\nYusunoha: Thank you for your reply and all the information. \nTo quickly summarize the project that I have in mind, I have a giraffe animal head that I want to put on a plaque, and make it look like the imguraffe. Imgur is about the color green, so I had the idea of adding LED's to the plague that you can set to green.\n\nThe effect what I'm trying to go after though is having the head be illuminated in a dark room. Having the back of the plague is an option I considered, but I wanted to focus the light on the head than rather on the plague. And by diffusing the light you will not be directly staring into the light.\n\nI had not considered the edge lit option, I'll take it into consideration, but I think it may be a step too far for me.\n"

Work up to 100 reps total each workout.  Once that gets easy, start adding weight.\nColoredMarxers: That is because most peoples goals focus around hypertrophy and strength. As soon as they hear something along the lines of \"30 minute abs\" or \"100 pushups a day\" They freak out because most of these programs are money/attention grabbing schemes, yet very rarely are they actually geared towards muscle endurance like they should be.\nbipocni: Unless I was in the business of selling chinup bars, parallell bars, rings or weight belts I don't see how I could profit from this.\nColoredMarxers: Oh no, I think you may have misconstrued my statement, i was simply mentioning that the reason you may have been downvoted is a knee-jerk response many people on this sub have built in concerning programs that *sound* like the one you suggested. I actually believe a sizable volume of dips and pullups (leg free workouts) would be beneficial and fitting for his goals/condition.\nbipocni: Yeah, it's pretty much the only two exercises that would work.\n\nFor otherwise healthy people you can literally just add 100 reps of weighted decline situps, and that's all the upper body strength training you need.  Add elbow conditioning and/or balance practice if your goals involve advanced calisthenics, but for simple strength/size it really is all you need.\nColoredMarxers: I would even go as far to possibly add some parallel bar or ring support work if he was up for it. Maybe even bar deadhangs for grip strength. It would be fun to integrate a little twist into a workout that could possibly get a bit tedious with time.\nbipocni: 100 dips &amp; pullups gets tedious like hill sprints get tedious.  It's hard, and it sucks, but you won't exactly get *bored*.\n\nDwas hangs and support work aren't strictly speaking necessary, but they could be fun.  There's also the capacity to do different *kinds* of pullups, like chins, mixed grip, neutral, offset, towel grip, ect.  Dips could at least be moved up to Russian dips occasionally.  There's definitely room for play, as long as the spirit of the thing is kept intact.\nColoredMarxers: 100% agree.

In this review, we propagate the functional renormalization group (FRG) as a suited approach to investigate multi-orbital Fermi surface instabilities. The primary goal of the review is to describe the FRG in explicit detail and render it accessible to everyone both at a technical and intuitive level. Summarizing recent progress in the field of multi-orbital Fermi surface instabilities, we illustrate how the unbiased fashion by which the FRG treats all kinds of ordering tendencies guarantees an adequate description of electronic phase diagrams and often allows to obtain parameter trends of sufficient accuracy to make qualitative predictions for experiments. This review includes detailed and illustrative illustrations of magnetism and, in particular, superconductivity for the iron pnictides from the viewpoint of FRG. Furthermore, it discusses candidate scenarios for topological bulk singlet superconductivity and exotic particle-hole condensates on hexagonal lattices such as sodium-doped cobaltates, graphene doped to van Hove Filling, and the kagome Hubbard model. In total, the FRG promises to be one of the most versatile and revealing numerical approaches to address unconventional Fermi surface instabilities in future fields of condensed matter research."

The exchange with the HOF experts resulted in a hierarchical analysis of ''radiogram interpretation'' tasks (31 sub-tasks) and a list of contextual and organizational factors that may affect the performance of interpretation of films by the operator. From such a description the CREAM method allows to determine critical tasks and probability of ``errors'' linked to a limited set of ``Common Performance Conditions'' (CPC). The first conclusions of this study are that the model CREAM seems well-adapted to the estimation of the impact of HOF on NDT performances.

Building on the reservation-based intersection control model proposed by Dresner and Stone, we consider two different scenarios: one with a single intersection and one with a network of intersections. In the former, we analyse the performance of a novel policy based on combinatorial auctions for the allocation of reservations. In the latter, we analyse the impact that a traffic assignment strategy inspired by competitive markets has on the drivers route choices. Finally we propose an adaptive management mechanism that integrates the auction-based traffic control policy with the competitive traffic assignment strategy."

We also report several lines of SiO, HN13C and H13CO+ toward new positions around this outflow, to investigate the spatial extent of the over-excitation of the ions in L1448-mm. From the isotopologue observations, we find that the emission of H13CO+ and HN13C from the precursor is optically thin if this emission is extended. Using the new collisional coefficients, an electron density enhancement is still needed to explain the excitation of H13CO+ for extended emission and for gas temperatures of\\le 400 K toward L1448-mm (0,-10), and possibly also toward L1448-mm (0,0). For compact emission the data cannot be fitted. We do not find any evidence for the over-excitation of the ion fluid toward the newly observed positions around L1448-mm. The observed line emission of SiO, H13CO+ and HN13C toward L1448-mm (0,0) and (0,-10) is consistent with an electron density enhancement in the precursor component, if this emission is spatially extended. This is also true for the case of high gas temperatures (\\le400 K) toward the (0,-10) offset. The electron density enhancement seems to be restricted to the southern, redshifted lobe of the L1448-mm outflow. Interferometric images of the line emission of these molecules are needed to confirm the spatial extent of the over-excitation of the ions and thus, of the electron density enhancement in the magnetic precursor of L1448-mm."

The game included three Zombies experiences on release day, four if a special edition of the game, or the Black Ops Pass, was purchased. The locations of the maps include the RMS Titanic, a Gladiatorial Arena in Roman Egypt, and Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. The game also introduced a battle royale mode called Blackout, which features up to 100 players in each match. Many characters from this and other Black Ops titles can be used as the player's character model in this mode.\nDevelopment for the game started shortly after the release of Black Ops III. Treyarch chose not to create a traditional singleplayer campaign for the game at the beginning of production, instead focusing on a new 'Career' mode with a greater focus on the multiplayer aspect. They cited an increased interest for multiplayer and lack of time spent by the playerbase on the campaign mode as reasons why they shifted their focus. Black Ops 4 utilizes Blizzard's Battle.net platform for the Windows version instead of Steam, the first game in the series to do so. Teasing of the game began in March 2018, with a full reveal taking place later in May. Two betas were held for the game; one for the multiplayer in August and one for Blackout in September. The release date was moved up to October instead of the series' usual November in an attempt to avoid coinciding with the release of other high-profile games.\nPre-release reception of the game was negative due to the game's lack of a campaign mode and the Black Ops Pass, a season pass that distributes downloadable content (DLC) in the form of \"Operations\". Black Ops 4 received positive reviews upon release, with praise towards its three modes, particularly Blackout. It drew criticism for the design of its microtransactions implemented in updates. Despite physical retail sales for the game being the lowest in the series in a decade, it was the best-selling digital launch in Activision's history, surpassing 2017's Call of Duty: WWII."

        "text": " aimed to formalize the conditions in which spatial biological control can be achieved by generalists, through an analytical approach based on reaction-diffusion equations. The population of the focal prey - the invader - is assumed to grow according to a logistic function. The predator has a type II functional response and is present everywhere in the domain, at its carrying capacity, on alternative hosts. Control, defined as the invader becoming extinct in the domain, may result from spatially independent demographic dynamics or from a spatial extinction wave. Using comparison principles, we obtain sufficient conditions for control and for invasion, based on scalar bistable partial differential equations (PDEs). The searching efficiency and functional response plateau of the predator are identified as the main parameters defining the parameter space for prey extinction and invasion. Numerical explorations are carried out in the region of those control parameters space between the super-and subso-lutions, in which no conclusion about controllability can be drawn on the basis of analytical solutions. The ability of generalist predators to control prey populations with logistic growth lies in the bis-table dynamics of the coupled system, rather than in the bistability of prey-only dynamics as observed for specialist predators attacking prey populations displaying Allee effects. The consideration of space in predator-prey systems involving generalist predators with a parabolic functional response is crucial. Analysis of the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) system identifies parameter regions with monostable (extinction) and bistable (extinction or invasion) dynamics. By contrast, analysis of the associated PDE system distinguishes different and additional regions of invasion and extinction. Depending on the relative positions of these different zones, four patterns of spatial dynamics can be identified : traveling waves of extinction and invasion, pulse waves of extinction and heterogeneous stationary positive solutions of the Turing type. As a consequence, prey control is predicted to be possible when space is considered in additional situations other than those identified without considering space. The reverse situation is also possible. None of these considerations apply to spatial predator-prey systems with specialist natural enemies."

In this state, the internal energy of gas particles in a volume of the object's surface layer increases over all limits in the frame of the volume and this opens the question if the horizon of events actually is an insuperable barrier. It seems to be possible that some matter can be temporarily lifted above the surface or, so far, be ejected from the object and can emit a radiation detectable by a distant observer. In our contribution, we demonstrate a general validity of the functional form of the potential-type energy found in our previous work. The consistency of the RETE with its non-relativistic approximation can occur only for this functional form. We also point out some observational consequences of the approximate identity of ES and RETE before the object collapses, in the proper time, to its gravitational radius as well as the possible observational consequences of the infinitely high internal energy in the surface layer of already collapsed object. In general, we propagate the idea that a lot of phenomena observed at the stellar-sized or supermassive black holes (or not-yet black holes) can be not necessarily related to the structures in a vicinity of the black hole, e.g. to an accretion disk, but they can be linked directly to the behaviour of the central, ultra-compact object."

        "text": " human beings, are a part of nature, and since we experience what we call love, love is logically a part of nature.\n\nNow, where did love come from? When did humans first come up with the idea of love? Humans identify with love, along with most deep emotions like hatred and jealousy, independently from the rest of the animal kingdom. We believe that we are unique in these feelings and thoughts. In essence, this is correct, no other animal has the human emotion we call love. However that does not mean it has no origin in basic animal instinct.\n\nLove, and other feelings of strong affection for an individual, is simply the advanced form of our reproductive instinct. Love for your children and for your kin is what we humans, with our extremely advanced brains, call the maternal/paternal instinct to protect those who are of our same blood: it is part of the basic animal instinct of advancing the perfect genes through reproduction and protecting those we create. Of course because of our deeper form of thinking, we attribute this form of love to those even not of our gene pool, like adopted children or unrelated cousins.\n\nWhen we attain puberty as humans, we begin a cycle of mindless love and what is socially called \u201cteenage love\u201d, in after which we mature and become more and more critical in how we love. In the world today, the older we get the more knowledgeable on love we become. However that may not be the case. As teenagers, males look for the most attractive female, and females look for the most attractive male, usually regardless of any other aspect like personal attributes. As we get older, we look for these more and more, until eventually as adults, physical attractiveness is very low on the list. This is a result of the animal instinct of finding the perfect mate while using our advanced human minds, which results in an eventual deeper analysis on the individual rather than searching for the physically and genetically perfect mate. Romance, in essence, goes against our animal instinct to reproduce.\n\nLove, in conclusion, is a made up term we use to try and specialize our unique form of the reproduction instinct. Because of our extremely advanced minds, this instinct is made into something much more psychological rather than biological, which is why we end up with situations like parental love for an adopted child, homosexual love, and love for an individual who might not be the best choice for advancing the human gene pool. Love is thus very unique in that sense, and something we must all be grateful for, for it is the only thing that separates us from the anarchic world of the rest of the animal kingdom.\n\nThoughts?\nnbca: It's a chemical reaction in our brain.\nKytro: The emotion certainly is. Your answer though is similar to somebody asking what is in chocolate cake and you say \"atoms\".\n\nBesides the emotion, there are also the concepts of love.\nnbca: Certainly, but most of what was once considered philosophy in regards to love have moved to other sciences as they have been more apt to answer the questions.\n"

Compared to a standard optimization, such a description markedly eases the treatment of systems with small number of agents. It becomes however useless for a large number of agents. In a second step therefore, we show that for a large number of agents, the previous description is equivalent to a more compact description in terms of field theory. This yields an analytical though approximate treatment of the system. This field theory does not model the aggregation of a microeconomic system in the usual sense. It rather describes an environment of a large number of interacting agents.

I feel gaming falls outside this category and more into sports or entertainment.\nBonzoTheBoss: With equal respect, I disagree with your definition of \"hobby.\" To me, at least, it is simply anything done during your leisure time for entertainment. That does certainly include the more \"hands on\" hobbies that you describe, but I do not think that it needs to have a physical outcome in order to be considered a hobby.\n\nFor example, I would classify reading as a hobby, but that has no \"physical\" outcome, rather just the satisfaction of a completed book.\n\nI also wouldn't say that a hobby needs to be a solitary pursuit. Why just recently I attended a beekeepers society event, where amateur beekeepers from around the county gathered to show off their wares and have them judged. All in good spirit, of course, but there was definitely a sense of friendly competition.\n\nSo, with all that in mind I wouldn't say that gaming was any less of a hobby than reading when it comes to physical outcomes, and no less a hobby for playing with others than beekeeping. There are, of course, those who choose to play single-player games exclusively, and those who never attend a beekeeping event but I would not say that their individual activities are any \"more\" (or less) of a hobby that those who interact with others.\n\nMy point, to reiterate, was more that whereas previously I might hop on for a few friendly rounds and have fun regardless of my performance the friendly competition and winning were secondary to the enjoyment of the match. Obviously I prefer to win but if I had fun it didn't really matter if I lost. These days it seems like the only reason people seem to play is to win, and any lack of performance (real or perceived) is ridiculed and insulted in most toxic fashions.\nasinine_qualities: &gt; simply anything done during your leisure time for entertainment\n\nI would expand this a bit. A hobby should also involve a fair amount of trial-and-error, learning, failing, figuring stuff out, getting better and mastery. I don\u2019t believe a hobby is limited to entertainment, because then it becomes a product that\u2019s passively enjoyed, like a book, it\u2019s readymade with the purpose of entertaining the reader. Still, I\u2019m not familiar with online gaming so cannot comment on whether these are aspects of it.\n\n"

Furthermore, if I did manage to get lucky, I am afraid of being shamed or laughed at the second the girl knew that I have no fucking clue of what im doing. \n\nI told one of my other friends about my insecurity with starting to have sex and he kept telling me to watch videos of how to eat a girl out and that I should just go for it. But even then, I dont feel comfortable because how the fuck am I supposed to feel confident without proper practice?\n\nI want to make sure that I can trust the woman I am with that she wont shame me or feel like she is doing me a favor by having sex with me. I want her to be excited about it and be happy to teach me the ropes. I don't want to have sex with someone that I feel might shame me and I don't think that im gonna find that person in a single night.  I now feel nervous as hell to go to this party because it feels like he is making the goal of the party the sex and now I feel like if I refuse to have sex or that if I do and fail, that he will look down on me. I've never been in a situation like this or had a friend like him before in my life. How can I take the pressure off myself?\nDisjoint_Set: I don't understand how his wanting to have sex puts pressure on you. All you have to do is not interfere with his pursuits, and maybe keep a woman or two engaged in conversation while he tries to seduce someone. You could be the guy that tells people it's his birthday, that plays better than him announcing it to women himself.\nHaunting-Leading-652: Makes sense. The issue is that I consistently feel like I have to prove myself to him. And I feel like he might have high expectations for me and Im afraid of falling short of them. I never felt like I had to prove to myself to a specific person before but ever since I saw just how good this guy is with women and how I pale in comparison, I felt like I always have to prove to him that I am just as much a man than he is. I am not even 100% sure he secretly thinks less of me(this could all very well just be in my head), but even then I can't stop fearing that he might.\n\nIn my head it was as if he was saying: \"Theres gonna be a lot of hot girls here, this is what im gonna do and what I expect all single guys to do\".\n\nEdit: Just thought about this. I think the fact that he constantly mentions that there are gonna be a ton of \"culitos\"(little asses in Spanish, which basically means, hot chicks), combined with the fact that he says that he is gonna fuck means that he might be expecting me to do the same because why else would you say that there gonna be a lot of \"culitos\"? Get me?\nElegantEntropy: You don't owe anything to any one, unless you actually borrowed or promised them something. \n\nTell him to have fun and that you will be there for the party. Then just do whatever you want to do.\n"

He is also the chief advisor for architectural policy to the ministers of VROM, of Housing, Neighborhoods and Integration and other ministers with responsibilities in this policy area. He is the head of his own staff bureau, the Chief Architect's Studio (Dutch: Atelier Rijksbouwmeester), which assists him in his duties. Starting in 2005 the Studio also houses three other policy advisors with similar tasks: the Government Advisor on Landscape, the Government Advisor on Infrastructure and the Government Advisor on Cultural Heritage. The four together are the College of Government Advisors.\nThe Chief Architect has great influence on urban building projects, as he decides which architects are allowed to bid on projects of the Rijksgebouwendienst.\nThe position of Chief Government Architect of the Netherlands has existed, under one name or another, since 1806. In that year Jean-Thomas Thibault was first named Royal Architect. The position was not unique between 1870 and 1920 as several Master Builders held the title simultaneously, each working for a different government service doing some sort of construction. After the formation of the Rijksgebouwendienst in 1924, only one Chief Architect position remained and he was in charge of the actual design work for government building. This changed to the current advisory position in the period 1958-1971, when Jo Vegter was Chief Architect. Following the new definition of the office (which was more neutral), the requests for the Chief Architect's involvement increased. During the 1980s his responsibilities were increased as well and finally it became necessary to create the other three Government Advisorships, to deal with the glut of work.\nIn 1998 a similar position was created in Flanders, the Flemish Government Architect."

It's extra hard for me b/c I am semi-tall (6'1\"), which means that on sit starts I am very scrunched up and have lots of legs and body in the way or hanging off the rock as I explode upward.\n\nFew gym problems are designed to train this kind of move, but they're super common outdoors. (Or when they exist, they just aren't nearly as difficult and awkward as what I encounter outdoors.)\n\nDo any of you have ideas for exercises that will help build *explosive* core power? Currently I do the RR about 3x/wk but do the bodyline drills daily. I think that training the front lever could help me a bit, but since it's not an explosive movement it can only help me so much. My only other idea so far is to do hanging leg lifts more explosively, but this will probably be pretty annoying b/c each set will require a lot of time to stop my momentum and reset. (Though on the other hand, maybe stopping my momentum will also mimic what you have to do on the rock once you've stuck the move?) I also wonder if deadlifts will help for this, though much of the power for this type of move has to come from abs, not lower back or hamstrings.\n\nMaybe users like /u/eshlow and the climbers and gymnasts on this subreddit in particular will have some good ideas.\ndarrensurrey: Not BW but BB glute bridges?\nohneEigenschaften01: Interesting, but I think what I need is the exact inverse motion. I'm always open to non-BWF exercises.\ndarrensurrey: Are you sure? If so, hanging leg raises? V sits from lying on back?\n\nI can't think how explosive core power would help a sit start.\nohneEigenschaften01: I understand your skepticism re core power for sit starts. I guess it came to me last weekend while I was in Bishop and really felt the strain in my core when I was trying these sit start kinds of moves--even ones with pretty positive hand holds. I think I felt it all over the core.\n\nI mean, I have room to improve all over--finger strength, arm/shoulder strength, back strength, *technique*! But for the rest of these I know exactly how to work on it.\ndarrensurrey: Well, from an overhanging sit start you are trying to keep your feet from touching the ground but that does not require \"explosive\" core power. It requires you to just engage the core to keep your feet off the ground. If this is the case, then try hanging L-sits.\n"

I can\u2019t tell you how often I\u2019ve seen people livid about being declined for something despite their great credit score and then say yes when I ask if they\u2019ve ever frozen their credit followed by no when I ask if they ever unfroze it.\ntazmologist: I would argue that a byproduct of freezing your credit is that you have to be more thoughtful in it's use.  If you have to unfreeze before you apply for a credit card or an increase, you will take at least a moment to say \"Do I really need to do this\"?  At least that has worked for me and improved my credit score by 200 points in the last 2 years in the process.\nGoodAbbreviations164: I had my credit frozen for a few years.

It makes saying \"no\" much easier.  \n\nBut yes, when I was trying to get a car loan after my car had been totalled, it did add an extra layer of inconvenience trying to get that unfrozen for the day so they could inquire about my credit.    I am in the middle of a lot of change in my life, so when it's all back to boring every day is the same type of life, I will probably refreeze it.\nSmartass_Narrator: Yeah it\u2019s tough cuz the company can\u2019t even tell you upfront that the reason you\u2019re declined is because of a freeze. Logically, the consumer should know about the freeze and If it\u2019s frozen it means the person applying *could* be the baddie and not the actual person (who should know about the freeze\u2026. But maybe they forgot! So many variables!). The lender don\u2019t know! It\u2019s hard on everyone! So\u2026 decline. Better safe than sorry.

These automata are specially restricted deterministic finite automata with translucent letters. In the other novel model we present, it is allowed that for a state the set of translucent letters and the set of letters for which transition is defined are not disjoint. One can interpret this fact that the automaton has a nondeterministic choice for each occurrence of such letters to see them (and then erase and make the transition) or not to see that occurrence at that time. Based on these semi-translucent letters, the expressive power of the automata increases, i.e., in this way a proper generalization of the previous models is obtained."

While many scientists have emphasized their concern for aesthetics and the impact it has on their activity, few computer scientists have actually written about their thought process while programming. What makes us like or dislike such and such language or paradigm? Why do we shape our programs the way we do? By answering these questions from the angle of aesthetics, we may be able to shed some new light on the art of programming. Starting from the assumption that aesthetics is an inherently transversal dimension, it should be possible for every programmer to find the same aesthetic driving force in every creative activity they undertake, not just programming, and in doing so, get deeper insight on why and how they do things the way they do. On the other hand, because our aesthetic sensitivities are so personal, all we can really do is relate our own experiences and share it with others, in the hope that it will inspire them to do the same. My personal life has been revolving around three major creative activities, of equal importance: programming in Lisp, playing Jazz music, and practicing Aikido. But why so many of them, why so different ones, and why these specifically? By introspecting my personal aesthetic sensitivities, I eventually realized that my tastes in the scientific, artistic, and physical domains are all motivated by the same driving forces, hence unifying Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido as three expressions of a single essence, not so different after all. Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are governed by a limited set of rules which remain simple and unobtrusive. Conforming to them is a pleasure. Because Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are inherently introspective disciplines, they also invite you to transgress the rules in order to find your own. Breaking the rules is fun. Finally, if Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido unify so many paradigms, styles, or techniques, it is not by mere accumulation but because they live at the meta-level and let you reinvent them. Working at the meta-level is an enlightening experience. Understand your aesthetic sensitivities and you may gain considerable insight on your own psychology of programming. Mine is perhaps common to most lispers. Perhaps also common to other programming communities, but that, is for the reader to decide..."

Surely they'd still have loving mothers even if their father was busy with business or a bunch of other children? But then there exist traditionally married families with children in the double figures or uncaring, work-driven fathers so this isn't the fault of polygamy. \n\nI really don't see how anything you've said is worse than the current state of marriage in which wealthy men have wives and several mistresses. Any why is that morally wrong anyway? The women live in splendor and the man gets his sexy time. They're all consenting adults here.\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: One man having 20 wives creates a surplus of male children that must be driven off to preserve the status quo, this is how polygamy is practiced in the real world. \nimjusthereforkitties: Contraception?\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: How would contraception help? They want numerous children, they don't want men to compete for wives with. \nimjusthereforkitties: Oh i thought the kids would be accidents if they were being driven away upon maturation. Well that sucks, though i still think polygamy would go down differently in western culture...but i guess this is what FallingSnowAngel said about polygamy's difference as an abstract and an ideal.\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: Polygamy is in like this in America in fundamentalist morman communities, that might not be the West you were thinking of but it's hard to think of a religion more American. The problem with polygamy is that it can't be a relationship between equals. The man makes the decisions and the women have to live with it. I don't have a problem with polyamory, but a system where a man can have an unlimited number of wives to use and control does seem morally and ethically suspect. If people have freedom to choose, education, opportunities it doesn't seem like a relationship that is based on women being property would organically arise. While monogamy has it's roots in property exchange, we have dating today, marriage is based on friendship, love, affection, commitment regardless of gender and not the economic and political institution it was originally created to be. Egalitarian group marriage is a whole nother can of worms, nothing wrong with having a poly family and it obviously works for some but I can't begin to imagine how to address the issue legislatively. If marriage is about love and building a life and creating a family (not necessarily children) then we should be able to find a way, but we certainly haven't gotten there yet.\n"

Obviously, losing weight would help with this and that's in process. But I'd like to work on pullups in the meantime.\n\n* How married should I be to doing the whole routine 3x per week? I feel like it might help my motivation and progress to split up push and pull workouts, which might look like \n-day 1: pull-ups, rows, dumbbell shrugs, squats\n-day 2: wall plank, parallel bar support, pushups, dips\n-day 3: rest\n-repeat\n\n\n* I have heard from trustworthy people that core work can be an everyday thing. I'm thinking about doing bodyline more frequently, like 4-6 days/week. Thoughts?\nThenthereweretwo: 1. Can you do diamond pushups? The RR says not to start pull ups until you can do diamonds. You'll probably do them anyway, so one way you can do that is by getting a band and looping your foot through it, reducing the weight.\n\n2. The FAQ says that beginners progress best with full body workouts 3x/week, but if you are more likely to stick with it if you do something else, I'd say do that. Just know that it may not be the 'best' way of doing it. To be honest, it sounds like you want to skip to a split routine because you think you'll progress faster, but its likely the opposite. \n\n3. I do body line every day. No problems there at all, and its awesome for my back.\nJonWhiteFanged: Quick point...\n\nThe diamond push up requirement is for dips.\nHorizontal rows is for pull ups.\nPogueMahone82381: That's kind of a problem for me then. I don't have a good setup for rows. \n\nI can do incline rows by resting my feet on a stepstool and using my pullup bar. Those are pretty easy for me, so I imagine I'd be doing horizontals if I had the equipment. I'm guessing the disconnect here has to do with the relatively large amount of weight I carry in my legs as compared to my upper body.\nFourOhTwo: Can you do a dead hang?\nPogueMahone82381: I can, and now that I look into it, it seems that's what I ought to be doing - thanks for the tip!\nFourOhTwo: No problem!\n\nMake sure to try to keep the scapula packed (retracted), open up the chest and look up.

It will notably be shown how a negative polarization of samples during deposition allows obtaining crystalline morphologies ranging from the classical columnar structure to a highly disordered polycrystalline structure with grains of several nanometers (nearly amorphous). The nanostructures of the films could be categorized in three types: 1) type 1 was nanocolumnar (width of column ~ 15 nm), 2) type 2 was made of short columns (width of column ~ 10 nm) and 3) the last type was made of equiaxed nanocrystallites (size of grains ~3-4 nm).High-resolution photoluminescence spectroscopy was performed to characterize their optical behaviour. The samples were excited by the laser wavelengths at 458, 488 or 514 nm. A broad photoluminescence band was observed centred around 520 nm in columnar samples. In the same energy range, the highly resolved spectra also showed several sharp emission peaks. This fine structure could be attributed to erbium transitions. This fine structure tended to disappear going from type 1 to type 3 samples. Indeed, the relative intensity of the peaks decreased and their full width at half maximum increased. This change could be related to the density of defects that increased when the size of the grains decreased. The photoluminescence properties of the films in the visible range will be discussed in relation with their structure."

As a consequence, optimization leads to parameters with low batch functional dimensions. We call this phenomenon geometry-induced implicit regularization.The batch functional dimension depends on both the network parameters and inputs. To understand the impact of the inputs, we study, for fixed parameters, the largest attainable batch functional dimension when the inputs vary. We prove that this quantity, called computable full functional dimension, is also invariant to the symmetries of the network's parameterization, and is determined by the achievable activation patterns. We also provide a sampling theorem, showing a fast convergence of the estimation of the computable full functional dimension for a random input of increasing size. Empirically we find that the computable full functional dimension remains close to the number of parameters, which is related to the notion of local identifiability. This differs from the observed values for the batch functional dimension computed on training inputs and test inputs. The latter are influenced by geometry-induced implicit regularization."

If this is the case then why isn\u2019t it the norm?\nsunnyday420: Because what nikola tesla was teaching was too accurate and liberating in my opinion. Knowledge is power and to understand light would be too empowering. It could be weaponized and it liberate humanity and remove the wealth disparities. \n\nI appreciate you hearing me out because i get alot of bad reactions when i explain the ether. People think its outdated and debunked.\n\nSo the ether was called \"quintessence\" by the greek philosophers and \"prime material\" in alchemy. There are like hundreds of names for the ether in different cultures and everyone acknowledged it until 1915 with einsteins theory of relativity. \n\nIn his theory of relativity it gives you medium of dark matter and spacetime.

Any other suggestions?\n[deleted]: I think humidity damage is inevitable but you can take steps to minimize and reduce the damage.\n\n* Proper flooring.   A nice tile or vinyl floor is going to be much more resistant than wood floor.\n\n\n* Drywall - It will probably be fine as long as it's well painted.   You may want to re-paint and seal the drywall once a year with a bathroom rated paint.\n\n* Ventilation - I would install a bathroom style fan that's rated for at least as many sq feet as your room and perhaps it's a good idea to oversize it.   Remember, for an exhaust fan you'll also need a place for fresh air to come in.   Have this fan on a timer.   Run it whenever the cover is off the tub and for 30-60 minutes after you put the cover on.\n\n* More? - If water is going to be splashing directly on any drywall, it's probably not good.  Replace this drywall with tile, or something more resistant to moisture.\nIf you wanted to go real fancy you could finish much of the room in cedar like a sauna.   \n\n* Caulking - If you anticipate lots of water on the floor, or on any place it might be wise to caulk places where the water might run.  I'm thinking like along the baseboards.\n\n* Cleaning - Keep the place clean.  Mop up any standing water on the floor when you're done.\n\n\nI think with some common sense you should have few problems.\n \nxanderrobar: Thank you! This is some great advice. I hadn't considered that most solutions designed for bathrooms should similarly work for this hot tub room. \nthews: These are all good ideas, but definitely add some extra foundation where the hot tub will be.  And it would be best to tile the floor with enough slope to push water into a drain spot.  You wouldn't necessarily have to drain it into the sewer,  putting a P pipe on it and letting it slope off outside somewhere where it won't mess up the foundation would be okay.\nxanderrobar: Is [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_%28plumbing%29) what you mean when you say \"P Pipe\"? I would definietely have to do what you're suggesting, as this building has no water running to it. It has a fully separate electrical panel and a natural gas line with gas heater, but no water (and therefore no drainage into the sewer very easily). \nyoda2088: Afraid to click the link.\nheaded4thecrapper: p-pipe or a p-trap is just a p-shaped piece of pipe that holds water to prevent sewer gasses from coming out.\n\nMight be good to tile the whole damn thing and put a floor drain in the middle so that any standing water has somewhere to go?\n"

For this, it is important that the channel has a cross-section size below a given threshold, which depends on the liquid surface tension and (for a static fluid) on the gravity acceleration. In space, when only residual accelerations are acting, such a static size threshold is virtually infinite, while a finite dynamic threshold exists even in the absence of gravity. The concept of a ''Space PHP'' was originally developed in 2014 by the team, and from then 17 Parabolic Flight Campaigns (PFC) and 3 Sounding Rocket (SR) experiments have been carried out to generate the data for the preparation of an experiment targeting a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) mission. Both a tubular and a flat plate PHP have been successfully tested in reduced gravity and on ground, by using different combinations of fluids and building materials. The need for having an experiment on a LEO environment is mainly because, during a PFC, only 22sec of reduced gravity are possible, which is a period below the characteristic time for reaching a steady state condition for almost all of the tested devices. Instead, a steady state was reached using the SR campaigns: in this case however, only one experimental condition was achievable, and long-duration data of the PHP performance still remains beyond reach. Several measurement methodologies have been used to characterise the Space PHP, like infrared analysis, high-speed camera visualisation techniques, with data processed with different techniques, from wavelets to inverse heat transfer problem solution. The results clearly showed that PHPs are very interesting for space applications due to their simplicity of construction, the capacity to transfer heat up to several hundred watts, a high power/weight ratio, their geometrical adaptability, and, in particular, the Space PHP will be a breakthrough technology for space thermal management."

I think if I wasn't doing grip training deadhangs I wouldn't even be able to hang off a bar. \n\nWould appreciate advice. Either put my head down and continue building reps with CC step  (I'm currently up to about 19 on the first set, 12 on the second. At my current rate I'd estimate I'll take another 4-5 months to reach progression standard) or move to a better more useful progression - if so what?\nhybridchildren: Hey, don't be disheartened, man! I've spent over 1 year stuck on some exercise then suddenly progress super fast once I discovered the weakness in my training. I'm confident you can do it too.\n\nSo let me get this straight; you could do 3-4 full pull ups before doing CC? If so, why not start at level 5 instead of level 2? I'm guessing I'm misunderstanding you.\n\nAnyway, like m092 says, my suggestion is to practice negatives to build up strength to reach full pull ups. I don't know how dedicated you are to CC, but I also suggest you abandon it (AT LEAST for pull ups; you can work on the other big 6 if you like) in favor of a different progression method. Depending on your goals, I think you can achieve full PU and OAPU following a simpler path. \n\nSo here's what I'd do if I were you. \n\n#1 do (or build up to) 3x5 sets of FULL, slow negatives for your PU training. No more jack knife pulls. \n\n#2 I don't know the rest of your workout, but if this is an important goal, put the negatives in the beginning of the workout. \n\n#3 Once you are more confident with your negatives, give PUs a shot again. If you can do 1 set of 3 reps, I'd say thats enough to move on from negatives and start training PUs themselves. Work up to 3x5 again.\n\n#4 If you have spare weight in the form of fat, focus on losing some of it through healthier/reduced eating. This will not only help your PUs but all other BW exercises. DO NOT amputate a leg or two for quick gainz.\n\n#5 report back in 2 weeks with progress, no matter how small or big. \n\ncomputersaidno: I'll try this. \nmyp123: Errr, still waiting on that report.\n"

In this paper, we propose a model-based approach that was conceived to handle annotations in a systematic way along the development process of interactive systems. As part of the solution, we propose an annotation model built upon the W3C's Web Annotation Data Model. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by means of a tool suite featuring a plugin, which has been deployed and tested over the multi-artefacts. The overall approach is illustrated on the design of an interactive cockpit application performing two design iterations. The contribution brings two main benefits for interactive systems engineering: i) it presents a generic pattern for integrating information in multiple usually heterogenous artefacts throughout the design process of interactive systems; and ii) it highlights the need for tools helping to rationalize and to document the various artefacts and the related decisions made during interactive systems design.

As addressing the blind spots, the neglected theoretical gaps in the text, is the central work of deconstruction, you have to apply the same ethic that Derrida applies to Rousseau to your own reading of Derrida, and in doing so you should (Derrida might hope) be able to discern the method that's at work.\n\nBasically, the work is in a lot of ways an exposition of Derrida's method, so what you should be reading for is not a concrete set of points in which he agrees or disagrees with Rousseau, but a set of tools that he uses and which you might be able to use in your own readings.  So look in the blind spots, look at what Derrida is doing, more than the results that may or may not be coherently spit out at the end.\n\nOne last semi-tip: Paul de Man's essay in \"Blindness and Insight\" on Derrida's reading of Rousseau is an illuminating work of deconstruction in its own right, and for me it made the process of reading Derrida make a lot more sense (i.e. I knew what the hell I was doing when I was reading Derrida, which as I've implied here is more important than knowing what he is \"actually saying\")\n\nAlso, understanding Derrida to some degree is absolutely essential to grappling with most things that could rightly be called post-[put anything here].  That, and it's one of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding things I've ever read.  It made me feel like I needed to go back and re-read everything I've ever read with a new critical energy.  Some call it wordy and dry, but for me it was a lot of fun!

We will in particular concentrate on the Fokker-Plack case, where u[$\\rho$] = V and V is a fixed function (with possible regularity assumptions) independent of $\\rho$, on the case where u[$\\rho$] = W * $\\rho$ is obtained by convolution and models interaction between particles, and on the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel case where u[$\\rho$] is related to $\\rho$ via an elliptic equation. This last case models the evolution of a biological population $\\rho$ subject to diffusion but attracted by the concentration of a chemo-attractant, a nutrient which is produced by the population itself, so that its distribution is ruled by a PDE where the density $\\rho$ appears as a source term. Under the assumption that the production rate of this nutrient is much faster than the motion of the cells, we can assume that its distribution is ruled by a statical PDE with no explicit time-dependence, and gives rise to a system which is a gradient flow in the variable $\\rho$ (the parabolic-parabolic case, where the time scale for the cells and for the nutrient are comparable, is also a gradient flow, in the product space W2 x L 2 , but we will not consider this case). Since we mainly concentrate on the case of bounded domains, in the Keller-Segel case the term u[$\\rho$] cannot be expressed as a convoluton and requires ad-hoc computations. In all the paper, the estimates will be studied on a time-discretized version of these PDEs, consisting in the so-called JKO (Jordan-Kinderleherer-Otto) scheme, based on iterated optimization problems involving the Wasserstein distance W2.

The resolution of inverse problems implies systematically the minimisation of a divergence between physical measurements and a model depending of the unknown parameters. In the context image reconstruction, the model is generally linear and the constraints that must be taken into account are the non-negativity as well as (if necessary) the sum constraint of the unknown parameters. To take into account in a simple way the sum constraint, we introduce the class of scale invariant or affine invariant divergences. Such divergences remains unchanged when the model parameters are multiplied by a constant positive factor. We show the general properties of the invariance factors, and we give some interesting characteristics of such divergences.An extension of such divergences allows to obtain the property of invariance with respect to both the arguments of the divergences; this characteristic can be used to introduce the smoothness regularization of inverse problems, that is a regularisation in the sense of Tikhonov.We then develop in a last step, minimisation methods of the divergences subject to non-negativity and sum constraints on the solution components. These methods are founded on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions that must be fulfilled at the optimum. The Tikhonov regularization is considered in these methods.Chapter 11 associated with Appendix 9 deal with the application to the NMF, while Chapter 12 is dedicated to the Blind Deconvolution problem.In these two chapters, the interest of the scale invariant divergences is highlighted."

More recently G\\\"ardenfors [2004, 2014] has developed a model of concepts in which conceptual spaces provide geometric structures, and information is represented by points, vectors and regions in vector spaces. The same compositional approach has been applied to this formalism, giving conceptual spaces theory a richer model of compositionality than previously [Bolt et al., 2018]. Compositional approaches have also been applied in the study of strategic games and Nash equilibria. In contrast to classical game theory, where games are studied monolithically as one global object, compositional game theory works bottom-up by building large and complex games from smaller components. Such an approach is inherently difficult since the interaction between games has to be considered. Research into categorical compositional methods for this field have recently begun [Ghani et al., 2018]. Moreover, the interaction between the three disciplines of cognitive science, linguistics and game theory is a fertile ground for research. Game theory in cognitive science is a well-established area [Camerer, 2011]. Similarly game theoretic approaches have been applied in linguistics [J\\\"ager, 2008]. Lastly, the study of linguistics and cognitive science is intimately intertwined [Smolensky and Legendre, 2006, Jackendoff, 2007].

The main shareholder in \u201cBulstrad\u201d was the Finance Ministry and one of the principal shareholders was DZI itself. \u201cBulstrad\u201d  dealt with all insurance contracts related to obligations outside of the territory of the country \u2013 marine, aviation, tourist etc., while DZI kept its monopoly over insurance business inside the country.\nApart the monopoly on insurance, after 1946 the State gradually raised the relative share of compulsory (by law) insurance. The Law for Property insurance was voted in 1958 and the modifications of 1969 enlarged considerably the range of compulsory property insurance.\nThe juridical monopoly on insurance has been kept strictly until 1989, when started real competition in insurance. Should be noticed, that although some of the names coincided, the newly created insurance companies were by no means successors of those existing before 1946.\nThe rise of the new situation in the business was a challenge for DZI, which successfully transformed itself to market conditions and kept its pre-eminent position thanks to excellent performance and the offering of insurance products of the highest standard. Together with its business development, the Company has collaborated actively for the establishment of an appropriate insurance legislation and was among the co-founders of the Bulgarian insurers association in 1992.\nIn October 1998 DZI was transformed into a public company with 100% state ownership. On 7 December 1999 in the \u201cState Gazette\u201d, issue 107 was published the decision of the Privatisation Agency to open a procedure for privatisation of the \u201cState Insurance Institute \u2013 DZI\u201d Plc. which ended with the sale of the company on 27 August 2002 to Emil Kyulev\u2019s \u201cContract Sofia\u201d Ltd.\nOn 10 October 2002 at the shareholders\u2019 General Meeting was taken the decision to rename the \u201cState Insurance Institute \u2013 DZI\u201d Plc. to \u201cDZI\u201d Plc.\nOn 21 December 2006, Eurobank EFG acquired over 90% of DZI's banking division, which was merged into Postbank in the third quarter of 2007.\nOn 3 August 2007 KBC received all needed approval\u2019s documents from regulations authorities and successfully finalised the acquisition of DZI with total amount of the acquired shares reaching 80,457%. \nDZI is headquartered in a six-storey landmark building in the centre of Sofia built 1914-1926 by architect G.

We find that intense dissipation regions mainly correspond to sheets: locally, density, velocity and magnetic fields vary primarily across one direction. We identify these highly dissipative regions as fast/slow shocks or Alfv{\\'e}n discontinuities (Parker sheets or rotational discontinuities). On these structures, we find the main deviation from 1D planar steady-state is mass loss in the plane of the structure. We investigate the effect of initial conditions which yield different imprints at early time on the relative distributions between these four categories. However, these differences fade out after about one turnover time, when they become dominated by weakly compressible Alfv{\\'e}n discontinuities. We show that the magnetic Prandtl number has little influence on the statistics of these discontinuities, but it controls the Ohmic vs viscous heating rates within them. Finally, we find the entrance characteristics of the structures (such as entrance velocity and magnetic pressure) are strongly correlated. Conclusions. These new methods allow to consider developed compressible turbulence as a statistical collection of intense dissipation structures. This can be used to post-process 3D turbulence with detailed 1D models apt for comparison with observations. It could also reveal useful as a framework to formulate new dynamical properties of turbulence."

An ad hoc probabilistic model of the input random vector is finally proposed in order to take into account uncertainties on the network input and to perform a robustness analysis of the network output with respect to the input uncertainties level. The capability of the proposed neural network-based identification method to efficiently solve the underlying statistical inverse problem is illustrated through two numerical examples developed within the framework of 2D plane stress linear elasticity, namely a first validation example on synthetic data obtained through computational simulations and a second application example on real experimental data obtained through a physical experiment monitored by digital image correlation on a real heterogeneous biological material (beef cortical bone)."

We assessed its performance by applying two or more of these steps to a rich epidemiological dataset. Privacy and utility metrics were computed for each of the resulting synthetic datasets, which were further assessed using machine learning approaches.Results: Computed metrics showed a satisfactory level of protection against attribute disclosure attacks for each synthetic dataset, especially when the full framework was used. Membership disclosure attacks were formally prevented without significantly altering the data. Machine learning approaches showed a low risk of success for simulated singling out and linkability attacks. Distributional and inferential similarity with the original data were high with all datasets.Discussion: This work showed the technical feasibility of generating publicly releasable synthetic data using a multi-step framework. Formal and empirical tools specifically developed for this demonstration are a valuable contribution to this field. Further research should focus on the extension and validation of these tools, in an effort to specify the intrinsic qualities of alternative data synthesis methods.Conclusion: By successfully assessing the quality of data produced using a novel multi-step synthetic data generation framework, we showed the technical and conceptual soundness of the Open-CESP initiative, which seems ripe for full-scale implementation."

Primrose automatically selects the set of valid container implementations for which the *library specifications*, written by the developers of container libraries, satisfies the specified properties. Finally, Primrose ranks the valid library implementations based on their runtime performance. Knowledge: With Primrose, application developers can specify the expected behaviour of a container as a type refinement with *semantic properties*, e.g., if the container should only contain unique values (such as a `set`) or should satisfy the LIFO property of a `stack`. Semantic properties nicely complement *syntactic properties* (i.e., traits, interfaces, or type classes), together allowing developers to specify a container's programming interface *and* behaviour without committing to a concrete implementation. Grounding: We present our prototype implementation of Primrose that preprocesses annotated Rust code, selects valid container implementations and ranks them on their performance. The design of Primrose is, however, language-agnostic, and is easy to integrate into other programming languages that support container data types and traits, interfaces, or type classes. Our implementation encodes properties and library specifications into verification conditions in Rosette, an interface for SMT solvers, which determines the set of valid container implementations. We evaluate Primrose by specifying several container implementations, and measuring the time taken to select valid implementations for various combinations of properties with the solver. We automatically validate that container implementations conform to their library specifications via property-based testing. Importance: This work provides a novel approach to bring abstract modelling and specification of container types directly into the programmer's workflow. Instead of selecting concrete container implementations, application programmers can now work on the level of specification, merely stating the behaviours they require from their container types, and the best implementation can be selected automatically."

You should notice a difference. Good luck!\nRough_Bonus: I should mention I only do it once a week, along with two different workouts a week for a max of 3.\nhiiknowjoel: I see. Since you've mentioned that, i suggest increase the frequency of your pull up and push up training, but with a lower training volume. Grease the groove more days a week, with a lower intensity. If your trying to get familarised with a movement/do more reps, its best to keep practising it. I suggest greasing the groove about 3-4 times a week.\n\n\nEverytime you walk past a pull up bar, just do your 5 pull ups and 10 pushups. But spread it out throughout the day. You can think of it as being somewhat \"lazy\" in your training. Keep your rests between sets a minimum of 30 minutes. I used to walk past my pull up bar, and do a random number of pull ups each time. Just did it when i felt like it. \n\n\n\nIn short, reduce your training volume and increase training frequency so you can get familarised with the movement, resulting in better form and evantually more reps. Good luck!\nRough_Bonus: Awesome, what if I got to a park for pull-ups?\nhiiknowjoel: Grease the groove still applies. Rest when you feel like it, and do when you feel like it. If the park is located near your house, crank out a few reps when your on the way to school. Crank out some more when coming back home. Crank out some when your on the way to work.

I'm a vegetarian so I don't get as much protein as most might from their food, but it's pretty adequate, plus I do drink a protein shake daily. I eat mostly fruits and veggies, quinoa, some veggie burgers (shit's expensive, yo), peanut butter, and oatmeal. Soda maybe once or twice per year, chips and crappy snacks maybe once a month. \n\nMy question is, will bodyweight fitness put on a lot of muscle? How hard can I expect to plateau, eventually (I'm no stranger to plateaus, they happen quite frequently in jiu jitsu and I've seen them mentioned a bit here)? Anyone else in the same, or a similar, boat?\nADDSail: It doesn't put on as much muscle as lifting weights would in the same amount of time. You will for sure get stronger and depending on your diet, get bigger if you eat above your TDEE. You can make sure you gain minimal size by controlling your diet and (arguably) staying in strength related rep ranges of 3-5 reps per set. \n\nAs for plateaus, with proper training, diet, consistency and patience you can bust out of them pretty quickly. Obviously skills like the planche may not include measurable progress every session. If you're just starting plateaus are not something to worry about. Given perfect circumstances, strength will go up every 1-2-3 workouts for a long time. \n\nGreat idea to supplement BJJ with BWF. I casually rolled with a V10 level rock climber once and the grip strength was on another level. Inescapable wrist control, even when sweaty. \neman_resu_tluafed: I go back and forth between deficit and surplus every day or so. I mostly go for maintenance but I have cut out some cardio and circuit training to be able to do BWF. \n\nOn another note, one of the guys I trained with at my old gym was a rock concert and former stone mason. His collar grips were unbreakable. \nADDSail: Yeah day to day variance is fine. If you don't want to cut cardio and circuit training you can just eat a little bit more. But if you're rolling every day you probably don't need too much supplementary conditioning. I always think it's insane how 45 minutes jogging on a treadmill doesn't even add up to a Big Mac calorie-wise. \n\nGi? Booo. \neman_resu_tluafed: Don't like the gi?\n"

It is quite expressive and features a novel combination of constructs that has not been studied before. The distinguishing constructs are number restrictions, which generalize existence and functional dependencies, inverse roles, which allow one to refer to the inverse of a relationship, and possibly cyclic assertions, which are necessary for capturing real world domains. We are able to show that it is precisely such combination of constructs that makes our logic powerful enough to model the essential set of features for defining class structures that are common to frame systems, object-oriented database languages, and semantic data models. As a consequence of the established correspondences, several significant extensions of each of the above formalisms become available. The high expressiveness of the logic we propose and the need for capturing the reasoning in different contexts forces us to distinguish between unrestricted and finite model reasoning. A notable feature of our proposal is that reasoning in both cases is decidable. We argue that, by virtue of the high expressive power and of the associated reasoning capabilities on both unrestricted and finite models, our logic provides a common core for class-based representation formalisms."

I'm working on it with Google Sketchup. The thing is, it looks good in my head and seems like the design should be sturdy, but without me actually physically building the thing I have no idea. I've never really built anything this big before.\n\nI'm using 4 4x4 6 foot corner posts, and thinking about connecting them with 2x4s. The question is how to go about doing that in the sturdiest way.\nrgraham888: I would use 2x6s around the edge and to connect your 4x4s together.  Depending on the length, you might want to add additional 4x4 legs if you have a particularly long span.  Connect the 2x6s to the 4x4s with at least 2 carriage bolts on each join.  Also, it sounds like you want this to be free standing, so you'll want some cross bracing on the sides and back between the legs.\ncalion009: It needs to be about 7 feet long and 5 feet wide. Think I'd need more than 4 4x4 posts? \nrgraham888: probably.  I'd at least do another post along the back section  in the middle of the 7\" span.  THat is, assuming you want to have the front section open for coutches, etc.\n"

        "text": " step. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started by doing a bridge hold and trying to push my stomach as high in the air as possible. I'm not particularly flexible and my bridge kind of sucks, so I think it's important to keep stretching those muscles to get that synovial fluid in there. Followed up with a few L-Holds, and I was surprised to discover that I can actually hold my legs out almost straight with my butt almost completely off the ground for a couple seconds before collapsing. Couldn't even get my butt off the ground at all a few months ago. I rounded out the stretches with some twist holds and amazingly I can actually lock my hands behind my back on my right side. Left side is still pretty tight but I'm seeing slow progress with a hand towel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn to pushups. I started with just a few conventional pushups to get the blood circulating, and then a few close pushups. I migrated to one of the beer die tables in the backyard and did a few one-arm incline pushups with legs apart at first, then together. Legs together is so much fucking harder it's not even funny, even with such a steep incline. I can feel my feet slipping from underneath me. I'm trying so hard to not rotate my torso when coming back up, and I'm trying to avoid splaying my elbows. Left arm is having a hell of a time keeping up with the right. I transitioned to the ground for some slow and steady close pushups. I've stopped counting and recording reps like I used to, I just go until it hurts but before failure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext were leg raises. Started out on the ground with straight legs, and the next set I moved to the bar. Hanging leg raises are a lot harder for me because I feel more of a strain in my quads, and I tend to swing a little. I tried keeping my core flexed and tight the whole time to avoid swinging, but at this point I feel like I can get my muscles burning more on my back because my stamina is so much less while hanging. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, grip training. Started with some clenched eagle claws, then 2 sets of 5 fingertip pushups to work the tops of the fingers. I did a few hangs from the bar to warm up, and then started some towel hangs. Jesus, is my endurance lower with the towel, and it's not even a thick one. But if I can get up to 30 seconds with the towel I'll be pretty happy with that, as I can do about a minute on the bar. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was it for the day. I went in, made my 1 giant meal for the day, started my fasting timer, and I'll try to hop on the stationary bike later tonight. Just thought I'd share this momentous day of getting off my ass and doing the right thing for a change. I'll keep going this whole week and stop being a lazy fuck. Thank you to this sub for keeping me mostly motivated throughout these many months. Cheers.\n5sav1age9: A week off can actually be really good for you and just what you need. Every 2-3 months I\u2019ll take about 5 or so days off just to give myself a chance to recover mentally and physically and I always come back feeling stronger than I ever have\nColdBoreShooter: Amen\n"

A LOT. It's not a big deal.\n\nSo here's what happens when you run out of money and try to pay for something with no \"protection\"-\n\nThe sale or transfer is declined and you are immediately notified. There are no penalties and you have an opportunity to investigate/transfer money/ or just decline the sale. Nothing happens and you dont lose anything you dont owe anything.\nEssentially you are promptly made aware of your financial status and are able - FREE OF CHARGES - to make decisions regarding that status.\nThis prevents you from spending what you dont have and costs nothing. Its essential. \n\nWith overdraft \"protection\"\nYou are NOT notified that there isn't enough money to cover something. The bank instead agrees to the sale on your behalf, gives you a loan to cover it and charges you 30 bucks for the service. You're giving them permission to fine you 30 bucks for not having money to cover something, WHY? \n\nNot having enough money sucks but for the love of God do not ask a bank to take 30 bucks from you every time it happens.\n\nEdit adding example for context:\nImagine you wake up payday, and it's a federal holiday you weren't aware of. You haven't been paid but you *think* you have so you go about your day. \nIf you have overdraft protection every purchase you make that day will have a 30$ fee tied to it. Get gas, buy coffee, buy lunch and BOOM you owe 90 bucks because you didnt know it was veterans day.\nWithout protection you'll be notified you dont have $ instantly and learn your bank doesn't process checks on veterans day so nothing happens.\nJJ_burrito: My bank just charges interest on the overdraft balance, can\u2019t believe yours charges $30 per transaction.\nMaybe look for another bank?\ntexaseclectus: I can't believe youre ok with paying interest for no reason. \n\nI could literally just tell your bank \"no overdraft protection\" and I'm being charged less than you. Maybe tell your bank \"no overdraft protection\"?\nJJ_burrito: I\u2019m paying interest on a loan. It comes out to cents per day which is much preferred to $30 per transaction.\n\nSometimes I need the overdraft\ntexaseclectus: \"Cents per day\" amounts to the same thing as that 30 bucks when you compare the alternative of 0.\nBoth sums are this equation:\n\n I'm not paying any money and you're paying *some* money.\n\nMicro loans are never necessary and you never need overdraft.\nJJ_burrito: Not true. Altogether I\u2019ve never paid $30 in overdraft interest.\n\nJust switch banks bro stop being dumb\ntexaseclectus: Drop your overdraft protection dude. I promise it doesn't hurt. I'm at your bank they said it's cool, you dont have to be scared anymore.\n\nthis dude is so triggered by my common sense he's reported me to reddit care resources!

Yeah people did then in NFL and bodybuilding. The side effects would actually be detrimental to a boxer. The strain on your heart would ruin you. \n\nThe guy trained 12 hours a day 6 days a week starting when he was 12. PEDs don't up cardio-pulmonary endurance, proprioception, reflexes, muscle memory, skills or power which is what boxers train for. They largely decrease recovery or muscles to trigger more adaptations in a time interval. \n\nWhen he had back surgery recently his bone density was so high there were complications from damaging the tools and his bones being too hard to cut. That's from training so hard at a young age.\nMFFKraven: You think someone can train that much with good genetics only? PLEASE. At some point he used PED's, theres no doubt about it. Different PED's do different things. Not everything will involve your heart that much.\nchadtwashington: So you're still just spewing conjecture and have zero proof. Not even some possibly qualified conjecture from someone credible? Yeah, he wouldn't be the first. Was Ali on PEDs?\nMFFKraven: Its hard to prove everything, it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t the standard. You probably think elite cross fitters are natural too eh?\nchadtwashington: One, I don't think about what Crossfitters do because I'm a heterosexual. \n\nTwo, what Crossfitters do today has nothing to do with what Tyson did in 80s. Fact is Tyson trained very hard for a very long time. You speak as if it's not reasonable for him to have received the results he got from it. How would you know? How much do you train?\n\nI didn't ask you to prove anything. But the fact that you can't find one single source of more credible conjecture than some random idiot on Reddit assuming isn't going to get me saying it definitely happened because of what Crossfit people did. \n\nHonestly, if it was an issue with how much spotlight that guy had it would likely would have been public discourse.\n\nThing is Crossfit training would benefit much more than boxing training from drugs. Tyson's training program was endurance first, hypertrophy as the result of having that work capacity. His soft tissues had tons of time to adapt to those stresses. It's just running, push-ups, dips, sit-ups and shrugs. Then sparring. And jump rope.  All limited by cardio which recovers much more quickly than weight training. \n\nCrossfit is much different. Weights. And all that cardio. Lots of conflicting adaptations. \n\nYeah I don't know man if you find 1, somewhat credible person that wrote reasonable assumptions with some sort of grounding in at least 1 fact I would entertain it.\n"

It looks like I could probably blow the air into the basement through the (wood) wall between the floor joists, immediately above the foundation's cement walls...but I'm wondering if there's a better way (read: \"is that unreasonable?\").\n\nAssuming I can get the air into ducts situated between the joists, I'd like to ultimately direct the air into the main level.  I'd love to have a register (or several, depending on CFM requirements) in the wall(s) of the entryway, but I'm not sure what to expect when it comes to running ductwork from an open space (the basement) into a (non-load-bearing) wall cavity.\n\nSo: Am I out of my mind?

Do you have some closets perhaps, that you can use to travel between floors and act as a place to run the ductwork through?\n\nMy cooler outputs 6500 cubic feet per minute.  Waaay more than an A/C, so the ducts need to accommodate the much higher air flow.\nTreDubZedd: The house currently runs electric baseboard heaters throughout.  I'd ultimately like to replace them with in-ceiling radiant heating (probably also electric, rather than hydronic), but that's a project for another time.\n\nI recognize that a cooler like this is going to have large exhaust (and intake) requirements.  I think if I run three ducts between floor joists, I might be close enough (while allowing for some air to blow into the basement itself)--each would be 16\" x 8\", at least.\n\nUltimately, I'm less concerned about how to get the air circulating through the house than how to get it *into* the house.\n"

It is a well-known fact that posets with the same underlying comparability graph have the same dimension. The first result of this paper links the dimension of a poset to the boxicity of its underlying comparability graph. In particular, we show that for any poset $\\poset$, $\\boxi(G_\\poset)/(\\chi(G_\\poset)-1) \\le \\dim(\\poset)\\le 2\\boxi(G_\\poset)$, where $\\chi(G_\\poset)$ is the chromatic number of $G_\\poset$ and $\\chi(G_\\poset)\\ne1$. It immediately follows that if $\\poset$ is a height-2 poset, then $\\boxi(G_\\poset)\\le \\dim(\\poset)\\le 2\\boxi(G_\\poset)$ since the underlying comparability graph of a height-2 poset is a bipartite graph. The second result of the paper relates the boxicity of a graph $G$ with a natural partial order associated with the \\emph{extended double cover} of $G$, denoted as $G_c$: Note that $G_c$ is a bipartite graph with partite sets $A$ and $B$ which are copies of $V(G)$ such that corresponding to every $u\\in V(G)$, there are two vertices $u_A\\in A$ and $u_B\\in B$ and $\\{u_A,v_B\\}$ is an edge in $G_c$ if and only if either $u=v$ or $u$ is adjacent to $v$ in $G$. Let $\\poset_c$ be the natural height-2 poset associated with $G_c$ by making $A$ the set of minimal elements and $B$ the set of maximal elements. We show that $\\frac{\\boxi(G)}{2} \\le \\dim(\\poset_c) \\le 2\\boxi(G)+4$. These results have some immediate and significant consequences. The upper bound $\\dim(\\poset)\\le 2\\boxi(G_\\poset)$ allows us to derive hitherto unknown upper bounds for poset dimension such as $\\dim(\\poset)\\le 2\\tw(G_\\poset)+4$, since boxicity of any graph is known to be at most its $\\tw+2$. In the other direction, using the already known bounds for partial order dimension we get the following: (1) The boxicity of any graph with maximum degree $\\Delta$ is $O(\\Delta\\log^2\\Delta)$ which is an improvement over the best known upper bound of $\\Delta^2+2$. (2) There exist graphs with boxicity $\\Omega(\\Delta\\log\\Delta)$. This disproves a conjecture that the boxicity of a graph is $O(\\Delta)$. (3) There exists no polynomial-time algorithm to approximate the boxicity of a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with a factor of $O(n^{0.5-\\epsilon})$ for any $\\epsilon>0$, unless $NP=ZPP$."

The method was firstly validated by the study of unbound states in $^{25}$F, for which resonances were already observed in a previous experiment.Method: Radioactive beams of $^{26}$Ne and $^{27}$Ne, produced at about $440A$\\,MeV by the FRagment Separator at the GSI facility, were used to populate unbound states in $^{25}$F and $^{26}$F via one-proton knockout reactions on a CH$\\_2$ target, located at the object focal point of the R$^3$B/LAND setup. The detection of emitted $\\gamma$-rays and neutrons, added to the reconstruction of the momentum vector of the $A-1$ nuclei, allowed the determination of the energy of three unbound states in $^{25}$F and two in $^{26}$F. Results: Based on its width and decay properties, the first unbound state in $^{25}$F is proposed to be a $J^{\\pi} = 1/2^-$ arising from a $p\\_{1/2}$ proton-hole state. In $^{26}$F, the first resonance at 323(33)~keV is proposed to be the $J^{\\pi} =3^{+}\\_1$ member of the $J^{\\pi} = 1^{+}\\_1 - 4^{+}\\_1$ multiplet. Energies of observed states in $^{25,26}$F have been compared to calculations using the independent-particle shell model, a phenomenological shell-model, and the ab initio valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group method.Conclusions: The deduced effective proton-neutron interaction is weakened by about 30-40\\% in comparison to the models, pointing to the need of implementing the role of the continuum in theoretical descriptions, or to a wrong determination of the atomic mass of $^{26}$F."

This is the same mentality as the person who steals your credit card and blows $100 on stupid shit at a gas station. It doesn\u2019t matter what they steal, it\u2019s the mindset of getting something for nothing.\nXavierYourSavior: 1. I never stole\n2. Stealing someone\u2019s credit card is.. theft? Not sure how that\u2019s relevant.\n3. In Russia for example, whatever the price tag is that\u2019s what they have to legally sell it for. It\u2019s not theft, it\u2019s ignorance on the stores part. If I sold my PC for 100 USD and it\u2019s an alien ware high end pc, and later realized it\u2019s worth 2000 and regret it, it\u2019s still not theft on the buyers part. Even if they knew it\u2019s under valued, it was sold for that amount and isn\u2019t theft.\nPats2k1: We are not talking about pricing an item poorly we are talking about a typo made by a clerk. This isn\u2019t ignorance it\u2019s a mistake. Have you ever gotten back too much change? I assume you would have kept that too.\nXavierYourSavior: I honestly wouldn\u2019t count my change because it\u2019s something I usually trust they get right and never occurred to me to count it unless it\u2019s a big mistake, one time someone at a gas station gave me a twenty dollar bill. I kept telling him it was a mistake and it took a few tries because he was confused and didn\u2019t speak English lol. Regardless, it\u2019s still not theft. If you have an item and accidentally wrote 5 dollars instead of 10, that\u2019s their fault and it\u2019s not theft.\nPats2k1: Your logic still doesn\u2019t make it right. Let\u2019s not use little $5.00 mistakes that an honest person might miss just to try and make a point. This guy is stealing thousands of dollars and people in here are boasting about how they got away with stealing hundreds and thousands of dollars from ATMs etc.\n"

Unfortunately, as we show, existing gradual type systems such as TypeScript and Flow are unsound in the presence of method extraction. The problem for typing any such system is that the flexibility it allows must be tamed by requiring a connection between the object the method was extracted from, and the function value that is later called. In Racket, where a method extraction-like facility, dubbed \"structure type properties\", is fundamental to classes, generic methods, and other APIs, these same challenges arise, and must be solved to support this feature in Typed Racket. We show how to combine two existing type system features -- existential types and occurrence typing -- to produce a sound approach to typing method extraction. We formalize our design, extending an existing formal model of the Typed Racket type system, and prove that our extension is sound. Our design is also implemented in the released version of Racket, and is compatible with all existing Typed Racket packages, many of which already used a previous version of this feature."

I'd guess you should start over with the floor. The siding probably should come off to get sheathing underneath it. I would think this would be in the range of several thousands, probably more than you, as a renter, would want to do, and you'd certainly need to get the owners permission.\n\nThat being said, you could give it a good cleaning. Pull the ivy back away from the structure and keep it trimmed back (if the owner is OK with that). That will help you find a lot of holes that critters can get into. You can patch those in a variety of ways (steel wool, boards, expanding foam etc.). I wouldn't insulate the walls until/unless you seal it from mice (it will give them a permanent place to live). If you wanted to spring for some floor paint, that might help keep dust down (after a very good cleaning). I wouldn't build a false floor over it (permanent critter home). Since you said there are no obvious leaks, you can use it for storage. I'd suggest racks to keep stuff off the floor. Turning it into a hang out spot will be a big undertaking.\nprozhack: that makes sense, I think we're going to do something like this, just seal the holes pull back the ivy and maybe use gravel to level the floor out. \n\nThanks everyone!\n"

This can drive the receiver design process by, for instance, allowing the instrument designer to identify which component imperfections contribute most to receiver systematic errors, and hence place firm specifications on individual components. Using SNS to perform this analysis is preferable to traditional Jones matrix-based analysis as it includes internal reflections and is able to model noise: two effects which Jones matrix analysis is unable to describe. SNS can be used to model any receiver in which the components can be described by scattering matrices. Of particular interest to the sub-mm and terahertz frequency regime is the choice between coherent and direct detection technologies. Steady improvements in mm and sub-mm Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) mean that coherent receivers with LNAs as their first active element are becoming increasingly competitive, in terms of sensitivity, with bolometer-based receivers at frequencies above ~100 GHz. As an example of the utility of SNS, we use it to compare two polarimeter architectures commonly used to perform measurements of the polarized Cosmic Microwave Background: differencing polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in polarization sensitive bolometer-based polarimeters; and pseudo-correlation polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in coherent, LNA-based, polarimeters. We parameterize common sources of receiver systematic errors in both architectures and compare them through their Mueller matrices, which encode how well the instruments measure the Stokes parameters of the incident radiation. These analytic Mueller matrices are used to demonstrate the different sources of systematic errors in differencing and correlation polarimeters."

However, it is necessary to maintain all explored nodes up to the final solution in order to prevent the search from re-expanding them at higher cost. Earlier approaches to reduce the Closed list are either incompatible with pruning methods for the Open list, or must retain at least the boundary of the Closed list. In this article, we present an algorithm that attempts at combining the respective advantages; like A* it uses a heuristic for pruning the search space, but reduces both the maximum Open and Closed size to O(kN^(k-1)), as in Dynamic Programming. The underlying idea is to conduct a series of searches with successively increasing upper bounds, but using the DP ordering as the key for the Open priority queue. With a suitable choice of thresholds, in practice, a running time below four times that of A* can be expected. In our experiments we show that our algorithm outperforms one of the currently most successful algorithms for optimal multiple sequence alignments, Partial Expansion A*, both in time and memory. Moreover, we apply a refined heuristic based on optimal alignments not only of pairs of sequences, but of larger subsets. This idea is not new; however, to make it practically relevant we show that it is equally important to bound the heuristic computation appropriately, or the overhead can obliterate any possible gain. Furthermore, we discuss a number of improvements in time and space efficiency with regard to practical implementations. Our algorithm, used in conjunction with higher-dimensional heuristics, is able to calculate for the first time the optimal alignment for almost all of the problems in Reference 1 of the benchmark database BAliBASE."

An alternative, relatively unexplored approach is to support such techniques at a higher abstraction level, using metaprogramming or reflection techniques. Can advanced programming techniques make it easier to transfer provenance research results into practice? We build on a recent approach called language-integrated provenance, which extends language-integrated query techniques with source-to-source query translations that record provenance. In previous work, a proof of concept was developed in a research programming language called Links, which supports sophisticated Web and database programming. In this paper, we show how to adapt this approach to work in Haskell building on top of the Database-Supported Haskell (DSH) library. Even though it seemed clear in principle that Haskell's rich programming features ought to be sufficient, implementing language-integrated provenance in Haskell required overcoming a number of technical challenges due to interactions between these capabilities. Our implementation serves as a proof of concept showing how this combination of metaprogramming features can, for the first time, make data provenance facilities available to programmers as a library in a widely-used, general-purpose language. In our work we were successful in implementing forms of provenance known as where-provenance and lineage. We have tested our implementation using a simple database and query set and established that the resulting queries are executed correctly on the database. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub. Our work makes provenance tracking available to users of DSH at little cost. Although Haskell is not widely used for scientific database development, our work suggests which languages features are necessary to support provenance as library. We also highlight how combining Haskell's advanced type programming features can lead to unexpected complications, which may motivate further research into type system expressiveness."

Truffle Instrumentation includes: (1) low overhead capture of execution events by dynamically adding \"wrapper\" nodes to executing ASTs; (2) extensions to the Language Implementation Framework that allow per-language specialization, primarily for visual display of values and names, among others; and (3) versatile APIs and support services for implementing many kinds of tools without VM modification. Knowledge: It is now possible for a client in a production environment to insert (dynamically, with thread safety) an instrumentation probe that captures and reports abstractly specified execution events. A probe in fully optimized code imposes very low overhead until actually used to access (or modify) execution state. Event capture has enabled construction of numerous GraalVM services and tools that work for all implemented languages, either singly or in combination. Instrumentation has also proved valuable for implementing some traditionally tricky language features, as well as some GraalVM services such as placing bounds on resources consumed by running programs. Grounding: Tools for debugging (via multiple clients), profiling, statement counting, dynamic analysis, and others are now part of GraalVM or are in active development. Third parties have also used Truffle Instrumentation for innovative tool implementations. Importance: Experience with Truffle Instrumentation validates the notion that addressing developer tools support as a forethought can change expectations about the availability of practical, efficient tools for high-performance languages. Tool development becomes a natural part of language implementation, requiring little additional effort and offering the advantage of early and continuous availability."

Perhaps just the fact that unhealthy food is cheaper relative to healthy food is part of it, but then that boils to poor choices, meaning we should focus on education. \n\nYou pair that with a drastic decrease in physical activity due to multiple reasons (decrease in labor intensive jobs, increase in sedentary leisure activities like watching TV) and people are going to gain weight.

At some point every discipline relies on philosophical tenets and axioms in order to start. The sciences for instance, rely on certain claims established in philosophy of science.

Energy cost is minimised when the diver passes through neutral buoyancy conditions during the dive. This generally implies the presence of prolonged gliding phases in both ascent and descent, where the buoyancy (varying with depth) is best used against the drag, reducing energy cost. This is in agreement with past results (Miller et al., 2012; Sato et al., 2013) where, when the buoyant force is considered constant during the dive, the energy cost was minimised for neutral buoyancy. In particular, our model confirms the good physical adaption of dolphins for diving, compared to other breath-hold diving species which are mostly positively buoyant (penguins for example). The presence of prolonged glides implies a non-trivial dependency of optimal speed on maximal depth of the dive. This extends previous findings (Sato et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2011) which found no dependency of optimal speed on dive depth for particular conditions. The energy cost of the dive can be further diminished by reducing the volume of gas-filled body parts in divers close to neutral buoyancy. This provides a possible additional explanation for the observed exhalation of air before diving in phocid seals to minimise dive energy cost. Until now the only explanation for this phenomenon has been a reduction in the risk of decompression sickness."

I used to put a lot of emphasis on it. I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe only way I can imagine focusing on the other person is by asking questions. Although, there's a slight problem with that... I often get really direct answers, from which I cannot develop the conversation any further. This mostly happens with people my age. With adults it seems to work really really nice.\n\nThere was this guy of his 40-somethings (a family friend), to whom I said: *I've always wondered, what do you do for a living?* We talked for more than half an hour and it was very interesting. He was so happy with that simple question that he went to praise me to my mother, later that day.\nSelfeducation: You hit the nail on its head. Ask simple questions, then ask questions about their answer. Easy way to keep a conversation flowing. Here and there interject your opinion or perspective, then ask them about their opinion. Eventually you'll notice natural conversations starting from this.\nIberianCat: Thanks! What do you do when it doesn't go so well? I've had people giving me one-word answers and it just straight up annoyed me. I usually take it as a sign of lack of interest and try to end it there.\n"

Its not a surprise...\nchadtwashington: So what you're saying is you don't have one single source and you've DV'd me for asking for one because you assume it must be true and because you've assumed it then so it is? \n\nGotchya douchebag. \n\nEveryone at that level of sports today, not the 80s. Yeah people did then in NFL and bodybuilding. The side effects would actually be detrimental to a boxer. The strain on your heart would ruin you. \n\nThe guy trained 12 hours a day 6 days a week starting when he was 12. PEDs don't up cardio-pulmonary endurance, proprioception, reflexes, muscle memory, skills or power which is what boxers train for. They largely decrease recovery or muscles to trigger more adaptations in a time interval. \n\nWhen he had back surgery recently his bone density was so high there were complications from damaging the tools and his bones being too hard to cut. That's from training so hard at a young age.\nMFFKraven: You think someone can train that much with good genetics only? PLEASE. At some point he used PED's, theres no doubt about it. Different PED's do different things. Not everything will involve your heart that much.\nchadtwashington: So you're still just spewing conjecture and have zero proof. Not even some possibly qualified conjecture from someone credible? Yeah, he wouldn't be the first. Was Ali on PEDs?\nMFFKraven: Its hard to prove everything, it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t the standard. You probably think elite cross fitters are natural too eh?\nchadtwashington: One, I don't think about what Crossfitters do because I'm a heterosexual. \n\nTwo, what Crossfitters do today has nothing to do with what Tyson did in 80s. Fact is Tyson trained very hard for a very long time. You speak as if it's not reasonable for him to have received the results he got from it. How would you know? How much do you train?\n\nI didn't ask you to prove anything. But the fact that you can't find one single source of more credible conjecture than some random idiot on Reddit assuming isn't going to get me saying it definitely happened because of what Crossfit people did. \n\nHonestly, if it was an issue with how much spotlight that guy had it would likely would have been public discourse.\n\nThing is Crossfit training would benefit much more than boxing training from drugs. Tyson's training program was endurance first, hypertrophy as the result of having that work capacity. His soft tissues had tons of time to adapt to those stresses. It's just running, push-ups, dips, sit-ups and shrugs. Then sparring. And jump rope.  All limited by cardio which recovers much more quickly than weight training. \n\nCrossfit is much different. Weights. And all that cardio. Lots of conflicting adaptations. \n\nYeah I don't know man if you find 1, somewhat credible person that wrote reasonable assumptions with some sort of grounding in at least 1 fact I would entertain it.\n"

Supporting garbage plastic products which is basically trash from the get go is Environmentally unfriendly and shoul not be encouraged.

Dumbbells are small, convenient, cheap and easy to store, a barbell isn't. The Barbell has its uses and is a very good piece of equipment, but the reason most people are on bodyweight fitness is because they either can't afford the full kits or don't have the storage capacity. I used to have a good barbell but I had to get rid of it when I moved house because I had nowhere to put it. \n\nAlso screwing a pipe into a wall might not be the easiest if you don't own the house, a lot of landlords won't let you have any fixtures, heck I've even known some that don't let their tenants hang pictures on the walls!\n\nI do agree with you that the product in the post looks like garbage and teleshopping equipment isn't worth it and shouldn't be encouraged.\n"

This established him as chief of the Gitando tribe.\nIn 1871 Dudoward married Mary Catherine, later known as Kate Dudoward, who was the daughter of a Tsimshian mother and a non-Native customs officer named Holmes. Kate's mother had been killed the year before in an ambush en route from Victoria, B.C., to Lax Kw'alaams, where she had been traveling to assume a chieftainship for which there was no male heir. Kate assumed the chieftainship instead.\nDudoward's own mother Elizabeth Diex was referred to by one missionary as \"the mother of Methodism among the Tsimpshean tribes.\"  Diex was converted to Christianity in Victoria in 1873 during a mass revival targeting First Nations people for conversion. When her son, Alfred Dudoward, arrived in a large war canoe to express his displeasure at this mass conversion, he soon converted as well.\nAfter returning home, Kate and Alfred organized religious instruction in Lax Kw'alaams and lobbied the Methodist church to establish a mission there, which they eventually did, in 1874 under the Rev. Thomas Crosby. In fact, it was the Dudowards who agitated for the Methodist church to establish a mission there.\nRepeated conflicts between traditionalism and Christianity led Crosby to suspend the Dudowards' membership in the church several times, until finally the Dudowards quit and joined the Salvation Army in 1895.\nDudoward had no (matrilineal) heirs and so adopted his own son and a niece into the House of Sgagweet in order to perpetuate the line. The son inherited the name Sgagweet and held it in 1938, when the anthropologist Viola Garfield recorded the house's order of succession. He had designated the niece's son as his successor.\nHis children included the carver Charles Dudoward."

From this extension, a parameter $\\gamma $ naturally appears, which is a measure of richness or diversity of species. We rederive the sampling formulae for a population with infinitely many species, together with the distribution of the number $P_{k}$ of distinct sampled species. We investigate the estimation of $\\gamma $ problem from the sample size $k$ and the observed value of $P_{k}$. We then exhibit a large special class of Gibbs-Poisson distributions having the property that sampling from a discrete abundance model may equivalently be viewed as a sampling problem from a random partition of unity, now in the continuum. When $n$ is finite, this partition may be built upon normalizing $% n$ infinitely divisible iid positive random variables by its partial sum. It is shown that the sampling process in the continuum should generically be biased on the total length appearing in the latter normalization. A construction with size-biased sampling from the ranked normalized jumps of a subordinator is also supplied, would the problem under study present infinitely many species. We illustrate our point of view with many examples, some of which being new ones."

Methods: In this prospective case control study, 27 soccer players with non-time loss GP (GP group: GPG), and 27 healthy ones (control group: CG) were enrolled. Static and dynamic unipedal postural balance asymmetry were evaluated with a force platform using symmetry index (SI), and Y-balance test (Y-BT), respectively. Additionally, subsequent noncontact lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries were tracked for 10 months. Results: The GPG revealed higher (p < 0.01) SI in eyes closed condition, higher (p < 0.001) side-to-side asymmetry in anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral reach distances and in composite Y-BT score compared to CG. They showed lower (p < 0.001) composite score for injured limb and higher (p < 0.001) side-to-side asymmetry in posteromedial reach distance compared to the cutoff values of 89.6 % and 4 cm, respectively. Moreover, GPG exhibited higher odds (OR= 7.48; 95 % CI = 2.15, 26.00; p < 0.01) of sustaining subsequent injuries compared to CG. Significance: The Y-BT should be instituted into existing pre-participation physical examinations to screen for soccer players with non-time loss GP at an elevated risk of sustaining subsequent injuries. This could help coaches and clinicians make valid return to play decisions."

It's kinda covered in grease by design (inside the head at peast) so might be hard to show anything pertinent.\nReptarKingOfCalzones: Just an overall picture to see where you are in the assembly process and what model you have.\nSecretConspirer: [Here](https://imgur.com/efF0hCh) is a photo of what I have going on. Added grease to the appropriate portions of assembly. This is obviously without the head reattached. With the top portion reassembled, I add the 5 screws underneath to connect the base to the head, then go to attach the planetary assembly. It's at that point that the friction between the shaft and the planetary assembly is so great that it shifts the planetary shaft upwards. Without the top on, of course, it would simply go all the way up (and you wouldn't be able to get the screws in anyway since they sit underneath the planetary assembly).\nReptarKingOfCalzones: Okay I have had issues like this in the past but not to this degree. Have you tried degreasing the bottom end of the planetary shaft and the hole in the planetary assembly with a solvent?\nSecretConspirer: It was cleaned with 70% isopropyl alcohol, then soap and water, prior to reassembly. This machine hadn't been serviced since it was manufactured in 2002. However, I will try giving the shaft another polishing (pun intended) and see if that reduces friction.\nReptarKingOfCalzones: This is the reason why I prefer the models where the top is removable with screws under the metal band. Much easier to service.\nSecretConspirer: So here's how I got it done. Cleaned the portion of the shaft sticking out below with iso again, and made sure to clean inside the pin hole. Cleaned the pin hole of the planetary attachment and also cleaned extra super well inside the hole where the shaft would go. Attached the planetary portion and it was juuuust enough to give a tiny view of the pinhole on the shaft. Shoved a paperclip through there and use pliers to force the shaft down enough while my partner held the planetary attachment in place, thereby aligning the holes ever so sightly more. It was just enough that I was able to get the pin punch into the pinhole of the shaft and leverage it further down, again as my partner held the attachment up. Bent the pin punch, too, but eventually I got it fully aligned. Then hammered the shit out of the pin because it didn't want to go back in either.\n\nBut it works. I cleaned it myself, reassembled, and it works! For a bit, at least, hopefully another year or two. There's still a whir when it runs, but I'm no electrician.\n"

A LOT. It's not a big deal.\n\nSo here's what happens when you run out of money and try to pay for something with no \"protection\"-\n\nThe sale or transfer is declined and you are immediately notified. There are no penalties and you have an opportunity to investigate/transfer money/ or just decline the sale. Nothing happens and you dont lose anything you dont owe anything.\nEssentially you are promptly made aware of your financial status and are able - FREE OF CHARGES - to make decisions regarding that status.\nThis prevents you from spending what you dont have and costs nothing. Its essential. \n\nWith overdraft \"protection\"\nYou are NOT notified that there isn't enough money to cover something. The bank instead agrees to the sale on your behalf, gives you a loan to cover it and charges you 30 bucks for the service. You're giving them permission to fine you 30 bucks for not having money to cover something, WHY? \n\nNot having enough money sucks but for the love of God do not ask a bank to take 30 bucks from you every time it happens.\n\nEdit adding example for context:\nImagine you wake up payday, and it's a federal holiday you weren't aware of. You haven't been paid but you *think* you have so you go about your day. \nIf you have overdraft protection every purchase you make that day will have a 30$ fee tied to it. Get gas, buy coffee, buy lunch and BOOM you owe 90 bucks because you didnt know it was veterans day.\nWithout protection you'll be notified you dont have $ instantly and learn your bank doesn't process checks on veterans day so nothing happens.\nJJ_burrito: My bank just charges interest on the overdraft balance, can\u2019t believe yours charges $30 per transaction.\nMaybe look for another bank?\ntexaseclectus: I can't believe youre ok with paying interest for no reason. \n\nI could literally just tell your bank \"no overdraft protection\" and I'm being charged less than you. Maybe tell your bank \"no overdraft protection\"?\nJJ_burrito: I\u2019m paying interest on a loan. It comes out to cents per day which is much preferred to $30 per transaction.\n\nSometimes I need the overdraft\ntexaseclectus: \"Cents per day\" amounts to the same thing as that 30 bucks when you compare the alternative of 0.\nBoth sums are this equation:\n\n I'm not paying any money and you're paying *some* money.\n\nMicro loans are never necessary and you never need overdraft.\nJJ_burrito: Not true. Altogether I\u2019ve never paid $30 in overdraft interest.\n\nJust switch banks bro stop being dumb\ntexaseclectus: Drop your overdraft protection dude. I promise it doesn't hurt. I'm at your bank they said it's cool, you dont have to be scared anymore.\n\nthis dude is so triggered by my common sense he's reported me to reddit care resources!

The main focus of this paper is the process of iterative development of visualizations as interactive interfaces generated with the open-source software Advene, that were an integral part of the research process. In this regard, the timeline visualization is not only of interest for visual argumentation in (digital) humanities publications, but also for the creation of annotations as well as the exploration of this data. In the first part of the paper we describe this interdisciplinary collaboration as instrumental genesis on a general level-as an evolving and iterative process. In the second part we focus on the specific challenge of designing a visualization framework for the temporal dynamics of audiovisual aesthetics. Lastly we zoom out by reflecting on experiences and insights that might be of interest for the wider digital humanities community."

In fact, it is usually on a dedicated circuit which is code.\nghostfacr: This is correct and proper.  There is a junction box at the bottom front of like, every dishwasher.\ndfoley1313: That isn't code. Code is having a GFCI with dedicated circuit. You can use a pig tail to connect to the outlet under the sink, but yes you can connect hardwired. But again why do that, it is not a code issue and it is more of a pain in the ass to do so. Also Norther Cali \ngottapoop: Code in Canada doesn't require GFCI. Most dishwashers are hardwired here so you'd have to buy an expensive GFCI breaker. You sure about that code? Our codes are very similar\ndfoley1313: Yes gfci breaker is needed sorry forgot to put \"breaker\" in.  We always run 12/3 one goes to the top which stays hot then we break the tab run the other hot to the switch back to the bottom outlet and you have a outlet that has both a 20amp circuit. There is no problem doing a pig tail on a appliance and plugging it into a outlet instead of just hardwiring it to the device. Again it is a little extra work but it makes installing it easier and is code. I have done a lot of remodels of kitchens and inspectors ALWAYS check for this. \ngottapoop: Ya I just did a little googling and saw that our codes are definitely different for dishwashers. We don't even have anything relating to specifically to dishwashers just that they are a known motor and heating load so they have to be on their own circuit. Most are hardwired luckily because if you put them on a receptacle they would have to be on an AFCI due to new code rules requiring all receptacles unless otherwise stated needing to be AFCI protected.\n\nDoes the receptacle you install for the dishwasher go on the counter top and you run the power cable up or do you install under the kitchen sink and do the split receptacle thing for future additions like garberators or undercab lighting?\ndfoley1313: Goes under the cabinet usually in the sink base. Never thought of using it for under cab lighting usually just the disposal. Using the 12/3 and the split receptacle is the easiest way to do it. Now most of the times we don't even run a switch for the garbage disposal we just have them both hot but on different home runs, but use a air gap switch for the garbage disposal mounted on the sink. \n"

In order to get complementary physical insight on the properties of magnetic skyrmions and to corroborate our research results, we utilise a plethora of key state-of-the-art advanced magnetic imaging techniques, namely: i) Spin-polarised Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (SP-STM), Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (Lorentz TEM) as well as, Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM). These imaging experiments can therefore stand as the base for all the other objectives in WP1 as well as WP2 that will study Dynamic properties: nucleation, propagation and detection of skyrmions. Imaging has been aimed to test and get feedback from the theoretical and numerical investigations of skyrmion systems of WP3. Finally, for WP4: Towards skyrmion based devices for information storage and processing, some of the techniques detailed here in D1.1 will enable us to image and test the first devices and their functionality. In short, the MAGicSky consortium research results in D1.1 constitute a major milestone that acts as a stepping-stone to every other experimental effort and we have achieved it.

The elementary displacements of the structure (e.d.p.s.) coincide with elementary rods displacements in the junctions. Any e.d.p.s. is given by two functions belonging to $H1(S;R3)$ where S is the skeleton of the structure (the plates mid-surfaces set). One of these functions : U is the skeleton displacement. We show that U is the sum of an extensional displacement and of an inextensional one. The first one characterizes the membrane displacements and the second one is a rigid displacement in the direction of the plates and it characterizes the plates flexion. Eventually we pass to the limit as $\\delta \\to 0$ in the linearized elasticity system, on the one hand we obtain a variational problem that is satisfied by the limit extensional displacement, and on the other hand, a variational problem satisfied by the limit of inextensional displacements."

If you are only able to do 5 full-motion reps, add on 3 negatives at the end of each set.\n\nBTW: for pistols, don't add band-assisting on only one side.  Do your weak side first until you fail.  Then do your strong side and stop when you reach the number of reps you were able to do on your weak side.  That is, if you can only do 2 reps on your left, don't do any more than 2 reps on your right side.  This will help you balance your strength. \n\nIf you'd really want to stick with band-assist, be sure to band assist on the right too, but still don't exceed the reps performed on the left.\nporkburp: Thanks for your help here! Sounds like you may have gone through the same issue as me. How are you doing with them now.\n\nI'm due for a workout later today; I'm going to try adding 2 more sets and will likely have to add a bit more assistance to complete all of them. We'll see how that goes for the next 2 weeks and hopefully I can break that plateau.\n\nAs for pistols, I'm doing band-assisted on both sides to keep it even, but only require for the left side at present. And I'm very close to evening that imbalance out.\njakehildreth: My best for bar pull-ups was ~~3x8~~ 9,8,7,4 ~~back sometime in June or July~~ on August 1st before I really started bulking up.  (Getting fat makes pull-ups HARD!)\n\nOn Monday, I did 6,6,6,5,4 ring pull-ups.  Was aiming for 5x6 but couldn't quite keep it up for the whole session.  I normally shoot for 3 sets, but like you, I wasn't getting enough volume because I could only pull 4 or so reps at once.  You (generally) want a total of &gt;20 reps every session, even if that means adding more sets.\n"

The last thing I bought was some hydrolyzed silk protein that I add to my hair and skin moisturizers. I also sometimes buy fragrances and flavors to add to existing products.\n\nThe thing is, you have to use common sense or do your own research. I'm just a consumer with zero experience in product development. If you want to get serious, you can contact M.C. for help with any formulation.

E.g. the inclusion of water in products providing the environment for bacteria etc to grow.  I find the idea of making my own products very appealing but for things like cosmetics I feel like there's a lot that can go wrong if you don't know what you're doing (not saying you don't know what you're doing, I mean in a more general sense).\nZestfullyclean87: The first thing that comes to mind is fragrance oils.  A lot of those oils can become very dangerous if they come in contact with certain cleaning products (such as bleach)\n\nAll it takes is someone to throw a used towel with bleach on it, into a laundry basket with other towels with the wrong oils, maybe you have used that towel to wipe up  the ingredients you used to make soap, homemade lotion.  You can burn down your home\nBruceInc: That makes very little sense and the likelihood of it happening is zero. Bleach reacts with ammonia which isn\u2019t a likely ingredient in a skin care product.\nZestfullyclean87: I literally know someone that this happened to.  They used bleach to wash rags that were used to clean up fragrance oil.  The heat from the dryer made it worse, so it wasn\u2019t an immediate thing, but over the next day or so they had smoke filling up the house and the fire dept discovered the towels burning through the box it was sitting in\nBruceInc: Some Essential oils have very low flashpoint. Bleach likely had nothing to do with it.\nZestfullyclean87: We\u2019re not even talking essential oils, I can\u2019t speak to that.  I\u2019m talking fragrance oils, which are often very different - something you would use *just* for the fragrance\n\nAn essential oil is when you take a concentrated essence from something (like flowers, lemons, peppermint).  They may have a natural fragrance, but fragrance oils are not the same as essential oils.  Raw fragrance oils are flammable \n\nOnce they\u2019re mixed in with something like a skincare product it\u2019s fine, but if you wiped up spilled oil with a rag, don\u2019t use bleach.\n"

The construction of the fluxes thus does not need any Rie-mann or approximate Riemann solver, and yields easily implementable algorithms. The stability is obtained without restriction on the time step for the pressure correction scheme and under a CFL-like condition for explicit variants: preservation of the integral of the total energy over the computational domain, and positivity of the density and the internal energy. The semi-implicit first-order upwind scheme satisfies a local discrete entropy inequality. If a MUSCL-like scheme is used in order to limit the scheme diffusion, then a weaker property holds: the entropy inequality is satisfied up to a remainder term which is shown to tend to zero with the space and time steps, if the discrete solution is controlled in L $\\infty$ and BV norms. The explicit upwind variant also satisfies such a weaker property, at the price of an estimate for the velocity which could be derived from the introduction of a new stabilization term in the momentum balance.

We have in mind that this is an alternative way to introduce selection or fitness in both WF-like diffusions, leading to branching diffusion models ideas. For this Doob-transform model of fitness, the usual selection drift sigma x(1-x) should be superposed to the one of x_{t} to form tilde{x}_{t} which is the process that can branch, binarily. In the first neutral case, there is a trade-off between branching events giving birth to new particles and absorption at the boundaries, killing the particles. Under our assumptions, the branching diffusion process gets eventually globally extinct in finite time with exponential tails. In the second case with mutations, there is a trade-off between killing events removing some particles from the system and reflection at the boundaries where the particles survive. This branching diffusion process also gets eventually globally extinct but in very long finite time with power-law tails. Our approach relies on the spectral expansion of the transition probability kernels of both x_{t} and tilde{x}_{t}."

When I switched on the dishwasher with the paper clip in line (in place of the flood switch) there was a tiny bit of smoke coming up from the paper clip for a brief moment.\n\nAll I can suspect right now is that the water valve is seized or something and potentially drew too much amperage, But then I would have expected a fuse to blow, but the drain pump works, the main pump works, the detergent dispenser flip door opens, all of the other electronic functions still work fine.\n\nMy first instinct would be to check the fuse that protects the flood switch water valve circuit but the wiring diagram does not show any such fuse exists In fact the wiring diagram does not show any fuses for the whole dishwasher, a Google search revealed that most dishwasher don't have fuses but rather might have a fusible link at the control board, but only one, and if that was the case then I wouldn't have power going to anything else especially the high amperage consumers like the motors/pumps...\n\nI'm not really sure what to check next, thanks for any help you can provide.\nlocus2779: Go to repairclinic.com and look up your dishwasher. Jumping a switch with a paperclip is dangerous for many reasons, but the expensive one has to do with logic. The control board may be expecting to see a specific voltage drop across that circuit, or have it pulled high or low. Simply jumping it runs the risk of shorting something out in the control board.\n\nAlso, you very likely want to see DC, probably 5, 12, or 24v, not AC. AC and control systems don't play nicely.\nSunstar823: Thanks,\n\n1) I went to repair clinic, it doesn't provide much information other than trying to sell parts which will be fine when I'm ready to buy parts.\n\n2) The system runs on 120 volt AC, I'm looking at the wiring diagram right now and it measured at all the main pumps and functioning units.\nbig_like_a_pickle: Unless your dishwasher is 30+ years old, it has a microcontroller inside it and additional digital circuitry. Digital all runs on DC. \n\nAgain, unless it's old. I'm guessing the only components that directly use AC are the pump and heating element. The valves are likely DC solenoids. \n\n\n&gt; there was a tiny bit of smoke coming up from the paper clip for a brief moment\n\nNot sure what the mystery is here? When you let the magic smoke escape out of DC components, they no longer function.\nSunstar823: The water valve runs on AC, I measured it today with my multimeter. The unit is 20 years old. I posted the model number above. I can assure you the water valve is AC on my unit.\n"

I don\u2019t think that such a selfish hedonistic reason for violence reflects Christian values, when the other option is peace and compassion for God\u2019s creations, creations that God made suffer and feel pain just like we do.\n\nTo me, dominion means protecting those weaker than us, not using our power to exploit and harm them.\nihateapartments59: You know Jesus fed the whole mass of people that was there gathered with a basket of fish\nMarkAnchovy: At a time when humans needed to consume meat for survival.

By considering spatial interactions with neighboring individuals, our model reveals several interesting effects: First, moralists can fully eliminate cooperators. This spreading of punishing behavior requires a segregation of behavioral strategies and solves the \"second-order free-rider problem\". Second, the system behavior changes its character significantly even after very long times (\"who laughs last laughs best effect\"). Third, the presence of a number of defectors can largely accelerate the victory of moralists over non-punishing cooperators. Forth, in order to succeed, moralists may profit from immoralists in a way that appears like an \"unholy collaboration\". Our findings suggest that the consideration of punishment strategies allows to understand the establishment and spreading of \"moral behavior\" by means of game-theoretical concepts. This demonstrates that quantitative biological modeling approaches are powerful even in domains that have been addressed with non-mathematical concepts so far. The complex dynamics of certain social behaviors becomes understandable as result of an evolutionary competition between different behavioral strategies."

Several species are components of biological soil crusts and contribute to the formation and stabilisation of soil. Some semi-aquatic lichens occur in this family, including about two dozen species of marine lichens. Traditionally, Verrucariaceae species have been grouped into genera based largely on the growth form of the thallus, and on the septation of the spores. Molecular phylogenetics research conducted in the past couple of decades has helped to clarify the phylogenetic framework of the family, but many genera remain poorly investigated."

It cannot estimate potential improvement in data locality through dependence preserving transformations that change the execution schedule of the operations in the computation. In this article, we develop a novel dynamic analysis approach to characterize the inherent locality properties of a computation and thereby assess the potential for data locality enhancement via dependence preserving transformations. The execution trace of a code is analyzed to extract a computational directed acyclic graph (CDAG) of the data dependences. The CDAG is then partitioned into convex subsets, and the convex partitioning is used to reorder the operations in the execution trace to enhance data locality. The approach enables us to go beyond reuse distance analysis of a single specific order of execution of the operations of a computation in characterization of its data locality properties. It can serve a valuable role in identifying promising code regions for manual transformation, as well as assessing the effectiveness of compiler transformations for data locality enhancement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using a number of benchmarks, including case studies where the potential shown by the analysis is exploited to achieve lower data movement costs and better performance."

This paper proposes richer counter-example structures called tree-like annotated counter-examples (TLACEs), for properties in Action-Restricted CTL (ARCTL), an extension of CTL quantifying paths restricted in terms of actions labeling transitions of the model. These counter-examples have a branching structure that supports more complete description of property violations. Elements of these counter-examples are annotated with parts of the property to give a better understanding of their structure. Visualization and browsing of these richer counter-examples become a critical issue, as the number of branches and states can grow exponentially for deeply-nested properties. This paper formally defines the structure of TLACEs, characterizes adequate counter-examples w.r.t. models and failed properties, and gives a generation algorithm for ARCTL properties. It also illustrates the approach with examples in CTLK, using a reduction of CTLK to ARCTL. The proposed approach has been implemented, first by extending the NuSMV model checker to generate and export branching counter-examples, secondly by providing an interactive graphical interface to visualize and browse them."

They were all at slightly different elevations and all slightly off level, but I put a post into them and built my deck off the posts, because after I had them all up I could go around and cut them all off at the same level. Using a post system was more forgiving than the joists because I could wiggle a post back and forth a bit within the block to get it in the right spot whereas the joists I could not, they would move the whole block.  \n\nThe deck block doesn't have to sit perfectly level if you are using posts. Pound it into place and then put the post in, and the post should have just enough wiggle room that you can level it separately. \nsoul_system: I was researching these 4x4 posts + blocks now. Do the posts just sit down into the blocks without any additional fasteners? Is that not insecure?\nSophieFrise: Yes, the 4x4 sit in the middle area and then you can bolt the frame to the post. Some use deck screws, but we will probably use lag screws to really secure it.  The deck with all the frame and the ribs and the deck boards should make it extremely heavy to where it isn't \"suppose\" to really move and it isn't like all the weight is in one area, but I guess there is always that chance depending on weather and soil etc.  In some cases, you don't have a choice, especially if your yard slopes like ours do.  So we will probably put a couple of them at that end where needed.  My choice for the part that can sit ground level is to have the frame on the actually cement deck blocks.  That is our preference, but for the life of us, we just can't get the deck blocks to level on the ground. That's why I was reaching out to see if anyone can do it better than we can.\n\n It seems almost impossible to level it.  So now, we are either going to dig a little lower, use flat pavers on top of our gravel/sand and level the pavers \\(which should be easier than the heavy 50lb blocks\\) and once that is level and seated to the ground, we will put our blocks on top of that and it should sit level.  Another option, again, dig a little lower and then we can use the 4x4 and have that come out of the ground and get as close to ground level as we can, but... honestly, having my entire frame on post that aren't cemented into the ground is not my first option.  I know folks that have their deck on post, but for the most part, the posts are cemented into the ground.  \n"

Furthermore, in certain conversations theme mentions are localized in specific conversation segments while in other conversations mentions cannot be localized. As a consequence, approaches to feature extraction with and without mention localization are considered. Application domain relevant themes identified by an automatic procedure are expressed by specific sentences whose words are hypothesized by an automatic speech recognition (asr) system. The asr system is error prone. The word error rates can be very high for many reasons. Among them it is worth mentioning unpredictable background noise, speaker accent, and various types of speech disfluencies. As the application task requires the composition of proportions of theme mentions, a sequential decision strategy is introduced in this paper for performing a survey of the large amount of conversations made available in a given time period. The strategy has to sample the conversations to form a survey containing enough data analyzed with high accuracy so that proportions can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. Due to the unpredictable type of theme mentions, it is appropriate to consider methods for theme hypothesization based on global as well as local feature extraction. Two systems based on each type of feature extraction will be considered by the strategy. One of the four methods is novel. It is based on a new definition of density of theme mentions and on the localization of high density zones whose boundaries do not need to be precisely detected. The sequential decision strategy starts by grouping theme hypotheses into sets of different expected accuracy and coverage levels. For those sets for which accuracy can be improved with a consequent increase of coverage a new system with new features is introduced. Its execution is triggered only when specific preconditions are met on the hypotheses generated by the basic four systems. Experimental results are provided on a corpus collected in the call center of the Paris transportation system known as ratp. The results show that surveys with high accuracy and coverage can be composed with the proposed strategy and systems. This makes it possible to apply a previously published proportion estimation approach that takes into account hypothesization errors ."

Therefore, it is expected that, assuming nodes can gather sufficient information about their neighborhood, one could get rid of the identities, without employing extra mechanisms for breaking symmetry. We tackle this question in the framework of the $\\local$ model. Let $\\LD$ be the class of all problems that can be decided in a constant number of rounds in the $\\local$ model. Similarly, let $\\LD^*$ be the class of all problems that can be decided at constant cost in the anonymous variant of the $\\local$ model, in which nodes have no identities, but each node can get access to the (anonymous) ball of radius $t$ around it, for any $t$, at a cost of $t$. It is clear that $\\LD^*\\subseteq \\LD$. We conjecture that $\\LD^*=\\LD$. In this paper, we give several evidences supporting this conjecture. In particular, we show that it holds for hereditary problems, as well as when the nodes know an arbitrary upper bound on the total number of nodes. Moreover, we prove that the conjecture holds in the context of non-deterministic local decision, where nodes are given certificates (independent of the identities, if they exist), and the decision consists in verifying these certificates.

To this end, the relationship between the properties interleaved in the univariate equioscillation theorem is clarified: first, a weak Haar condition is proposed, which simply implies existence. Second, the equioscillation condition is shown to be equivalent to the optimality condition of convex optimization, hence characterizing optimality independently from uniqueness. It is reformulated as the synchronized oscillations between the error extrema and the components of a related Haar matrix kernel vector, in a way that applies to multivariate approximation. Third, an additional requirement on the involved Haar matrix and its kernel vector, called strong equioscillation, is proved to be sufficient for the strong uniqueness of the solution. These three disconnected conditions give rise to a multivariate equioscillation theorem, where existence, characterization by equioscillation and strong uniqueness are separated, without involving the too restrictive Haar condition. Remarkably, relying on optimality condition of convex optimization gives rise to a quite simple proof. Instances of multivariate problems with strongly unique, non-strong but unique and non-unique solutions are presented to illustrate the scope of the theorem."

The later parts of this paper use the spinor representation to investigate minimal surfaces with embedded planar ends. In general, we show for a spin structure S on a compact Riemann surface M with punctures at P that the space of all such (possibly periodic) minimal immersions of M\\setminus P into \\bbR^3 (upto homothety) is the the product of S^1\\times H^3 with the Grassmanian of 2-planes in a complex vector space \\calK of meromorphic sections of S.

Our algorithm is then compared to a random forest method; the two showed similar performances but the algorithm presented in this paper improved insight into the grounds of each classification.Conclusions. This robust classification method can be tailored to include additional or different source classes and can be applied to other X-ray catalogs. The transparency of the classification compared to other methods makes it a useful tool in the search for homogeneous populations or rare source types, including multi-messenger events. Such a tool will be increasingly valuable with the development of surveys of unprecedented size, such as LSST, SKA and Athena, and the search for counterparts of multi-messenger events."

However, while the green route has had a positive evolution, it has been the publication in gold journals that has boosted access to Argentine production more rapidly. We concluded that the OA-based methodology, piloted here for the first time, is viable for tracking Open Access in Argentina since it yields percentages similar to other national and international studies.

        "text": " subsequent Cold War, suggestions were made that the Soviet presence in Eastern Europe may have been reduced had Eisenhower sent a narrow-front thrust to race the USSR to Berlin in 1945.\nEisenhower's decision was based on both political and military factors. There were serious reservations in the autumn of 1944 about whether the Allied logistical system could support the narrow-front strategy, because at that time there were insufficient working ports to support large formations far from the coast, the road and rail transport network was already under severe strain, and there were concerns about being able to protect the narrow supply lines deep into enemy territory, through terrain that included crossing many rivers, in weather which hampered air support. In addition the Allied occupation zones in Germany had been agreed upon in February 1944, and a faster Allied advance in the autumn of 1944 would not have altered this. The Soviet Union would have also benefited from a rapid German collapse, and its participation in the war against Japan was greatly desired. The staff at Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) considered Montgomery's proposed advance on the Ruhr and Berlin and Bradley's proposed advance on Metz and the Saar, and assessed both to be feasible, but only on the assumptions that the port of Antwerp was brought rapidly into service, that considerable additional air, rail and road transportation became available, and that the other Allied armies were already poised on the German border. These assumptions were not met until very late in the year, by which time circumstances had changed. The consequences if the narrow front advance had failed, would have been severe.\nThe British historian A. J. P. Taylor credited Chester Wilmot's The Struggle For Europe (1952) as the work that \"launched the myths that Eisenhower prevented Montgomery from winning the war in 1944\". Few historians on either side of the Atlantic accept ending the war in 1944 was possible. \"Wilmot's book\", American historian Maurice Matloff wrote, \"must be taken for what it represents\u2014a suggestive, provocative work on the war written from a British point of view in a period of disenchantment.\" Montgomery's Chief of Staff, Major-General Freddie de Guingand, stated in his post-war account that he had opposed Montgomery's narrow front strategy on political and administrative grounds, but Montgomery's wartime Chief Administrative Officer, Major-General Miles Graham defended his contention that the narrow front advance was logistically feasible."

The operator $R(A)$ has also two setbacks: -i) it is not an idempotent (and therefore it does not have a genuine Connes-Chern character); -ii) even if it were an idempotent, its Connes-Chern character would belong to the cyclic homology of the algebra of smoothing operators (with \\emph{arbitrary} supports, which is \\emph{trivial}. This paper presents a new solution to the difficulties raised by the two setbacks. For which concerns -i), we show that although $R(A)$ is not an idempotent, it satisfies the identity $ (\\mathbf{R}(A))^{2} \\;=\\; \\mathbf{R}(A) - [\\mathbf{R}(A) . e + e .\\mathbf{R}(A) ]. $ We show that the operator $R(A)$ has a genuine Chern character provided the cyclic homology complex of the algebra of smoothing operators is \\emph{localised} to the separable sub-algebra $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{C} + \\mathbb{C} . e$, see Sect. 8.1. For which concerns -ii), we introduce the notion of \\emph{local} cyclic homology; this is constructed on the foot-steps of the Alexander-Spanier homology, i.e. by filtering the chains of the cyclic homology complex of the algebra of smoothing operators by their distributional support, see Sect. 7. Using these new instruments, we give a reformulation of the Connes-Moscovici local Index Theorem, see Theorem 23, Sect. 9. As a corollary of this theorem, we show that the \\emph{local} cyclic homology of the algebra of smoothing operators is at least as big as the Alexander-Spanier homology of the base manifold. The present reformulation of Connes-Moscovici local index theorem opens the way to new investigations, see Sect. 10."

A tea that contains carcinogens is going to have the potential to insurance your risk for cancer depending on how long, how often, and how much you consume. \n\nTeas and supplements are the least regulated industries and are very often found to contain none of the active ingredients promised, contaminants like prescription drugs, high levels of pesticides and harmful chemicals, and/or much higher or lower levels of the active ingredients promised on the label. Because of these inconsistencies and unknowns they can be very dangerous, or just be a waste of money. There have been some studies that have shown an increased risk of certain types of cancers (esophageal and stomach) with drinking Yerba mate tea, but they aren\u2019t conclusive or entirely sure if it\u2019s the temperature of the tea or the preparation. Either way, it\u2019s important to understand that you should know what you\u2019re putting in your body.

You can take things for years and they aren\u2019t going to cause immediate problems. Cancer doesn\u2019t show up over night or even within weeks. Things like organ failure can happen, but it usually takes a pretty high dose of something, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not causing issues.\n6BlueWolf9: Bro chill, this is just casual conversation.

Here we analyze how shadow libraries can affect researchers' citation practices, highlighting some counter-intuitive findings about their impact on the Open Access Citation Advantage (OACA). Based on a large randomized sample, this study first shows that OA publications, including those in fully OA journals, receive more citations than their subscription-based counterparts do. However, the OACA has slightly decreased over the seven last years. The introduction of a distinction between those accessible or not via the Scihub platform among subscription-based suggest that the generalization of its use cancels the positive effect of OA publishing. The results show that publications in fully OA journals are victims of the success of Sci-hub. Thus, paradoxically, although Sci-hub may seem to facilitate access to scientific knowledge, it negatively affects the OA movement as a whole, by reducing the comparative advantage of OA publications in terms of visibility for researchers. The democratization of the use of Sci-hub may therefore lead to a vicious cycle, hindering efforts to develop full OA strategies without proposing a credible and sustainable alternative model for the dissemination of scientific knowledge."

We examine the current state of the art and areas in need of continued development. For example, medical image-based model-building software has been developed based on numerous different methods. However, none of them can be used to construct a model with a simple \"click of a button\". The creation of a faithful, representative anatomic model, especially in pediatric subjects, often requires skilled manual intervention. In addition, information from a second imaging modality is often required to facilitate this process. We describe the technical aspects of model building, provide a definition of some of the most commonly used terms and techniques (e.g. meshes, mesh convergence, Navier-Stokes equations, and boundary conditions), and the assumptions used in running the simulations. Particular attention is paid to the assignment of boundary conditions as this point is of critical importance in the current areas of research within the realm of congenital heart disease. Finally, examples are provided demonstrating how computer simulations can provide an opportunity to \"acquire\" data currently unobtainable by other modalities, with essentially no risk to patients. To illustrate these points, novel simulation examples of virtual Fontan conversion (from preoperative data to predicted postoperative state) and outcomes of different surgical designs are presented. The need for validation of the currently employed techniques and predicted results are required and the methods remain in their infancy. While the daily application of these technologies to patient-specific clinical scenarios likely remains years away, the ever increasing interest in this area among both clinicians and engineers makes its eventual use far more likely than ever before and, some could argue, only a matter of [computing] time."

For low back, there are two ways you can do it-- by moving your low back with it, or not. If you want to keep it out of your low back, then tuck your tailbone while you lift your legs solely with your butt + legs. Don't expect to lift your legs very high this way, but you do put more work on your butt/legs. Instead of thinking \"tuck your tailbone\", you could also think of it like trying to draw your navel up away from the floor while you lift your legs.\n\nIf your low back isn't irritated by it, there's no inherent harm in moving with your low back. You could even try both ways!\nvaughannt: Awesome, thank you for the reply!\nstickysweetastytreat: Yw, good luck!\n"

The dust-cover box they came in says \"multi-purpose and flooring\".\n\nSo, the door is aligned the way it needs to be to not scrape the grass when opened, and now there's a broken screw jutting out where I need to put an actual whatever-type-of-fastener.\n\nHelp?

Screws will last a lot longer than nails if you can manage to get them installed. The kind of screws you want are \"decking\" or \"exterior coated\" screws. If you have trouble driving them in, use a 1/8\" drill bit to predrill the holes. Go about the length of the screw minus half an inch deep with the drill bit, then drive the screw in the hole.\n[deleted]: Yeah, no exterior coated anything. A few rust coated screws about the same size/shape that I could clean off. \n\nThe nails are left-overs from when we (my neighbors and beer) put together a patio, but I can only assume (because the neighbour got them, not us) that they were rated for outdoors.\njakkarth: If they're not coated, they'll rot/rust. That'll lead to poor structural performance (your fence falls apart) and discoloration (black stains trailing down from the screw heads). In some cases the exterior rated screws are also stronger than their interior counterparts.\n[deleted]: What i'm taking from that is \"Exterior coated nails, though inferior to exterior coated screws, are preferable to interior coated screws\"?\njakkarth: That is my recommendation, yes. I would not build a fence for my mother using anything less than exterior coated screws, but given a choice between galvanized/exterior nails and drywall/interior screws, I'd go with the nails.\n[deleted]: Thanks, your mother is a lucky lady. I'm going to grab some exterior screws later in the day, and make sure to drill in some holes before I try to install 'em.\n\nAlso, the pliers didn't work to pull out the screw, it just stripped the screw more. So I cut it off. Is that \"ok\", or are there screw-removal pliers is should look into?\njakkarth: I'd probably leave it. The [vice grip](http://tungstencarbidefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/vicegrip.jpg) pliers are my go-to for removing screws with broken-off heads, so if that didn't work you're probably better off just cutting it off.

The method, named SICOMORE, reduces the dimension of the search space by selecting a subset of supervariables in the two complementary datasets. These supervariables are given by a weighted group structure defined on sets of variables at different scales. A Lasso selection is then applied on each type of supervariable to obtain a subset of potential interactions that will be explored via linear model testing. Results. We compare SICOMORE with other approaches in simulations, with varying sample sizes, noise, and numbers of true interactions. SICOMORE exhibits convincing results in terms of recall, as well as competitive performances with respect to running time. The method is also used to detect interaction between genomic markers in Medicago truncatula and metagenomic markers in its rhizosphere bacterial community. Software availability.

If the cat has enough stimulation (cat trees, toys, owners who spend time playing with it etc.) it can live a perfectly happy life indoors. You can also use a harness to walk your cat like a dog, if you want it to experience the outdoors safely.\n\nIt's not only safer for wildlife, but also for the cat itself (no worrying about other cats attacking/infecting it, dogs or wild predators killing it, awful people stealing or hurting it, cars running over it, etc.).\nno112358: So you're saying animals behave the same if locked up or free?

Even a few leftover can easily repopulate. \n\nOf course they don't kill 100% of birds, but there are plenty of studies about cat impact on wildlife (not on lit birds, also rodents, lizards, marsupials etc.).

        "text": " a compiler is even harder. We address this problem by developing a compiler design approach that reuses parts of an existing non-incremental compiler to lower the cost of building an incremental compiler. It also gives an intuition into compiling difficult-to-incrementalize language features through staging. Approach: We use the compiler design approach presented in this paper to develop an incremental compiler for the Stratego term-rewriting language. This language has a set of features that at first glance look incompatible with incremental compilation. Therefore, we treat Stratego as our critical case to demonstrate the approach on. We show how this approach decomposes the original compiler and has a solution to compile Stratego incrementally. The key idea on which we build our incremental compiler is to internally use an incremental build system to wire together the components we extract from the original compiler. Knowledge: The resulting compiler is already in use as a replacement of the original whole-program compiler. We find that the incremental build system inside the compiler is a crucial component of our approach. This allows a compiler writer to think in multiple steps of compilation, and combine that into a incremental compiler almost effortlessly. Normally, separate compilation \\`a la C is facilitated by an external build system, where the programmer is responsible for managing dependencies between files. We reuse an existing sound and optimal incremental build system, and integrate its dependency tracking into the compiler. Grounding: The incremental compiler for Stratego is available as an artefact along with this article. We evaluate it on a large Stratego project to test its performance. The benchmark replays edits to the Stratego project from version control. These benchmarks are part of the artefact, packaged as a virtual machine image for easy reproducibility. Importance: Although we demonstrate our design approach on the Stratego programming language, we also describe it generally throughout this paper. Many currently used programming languages have a compiler that is much slower than necessary. Our design provides an approach to change this, by reusing an existing compiler and making it incremental within a reasonable amount of time."

In this work, we model the address space of memory-disaggregated systems as the far-memory model, present the collective allocator abstraction, which enables us to specify object placement aware of memory address subspaces, and apply it to programming aware of the far-memory model. The far-memory model provides a view of the nonuniform memory space while hiding the details. In the model, the virtual address space is divided into two subspaces; one is subject to swapping and the other is not. The swapping subspace is further divided into even-sized pages, which are units of swapping. The collective allocator abstraction forms an allocator as a collection of sub-allocators, each of which owns a distinct subspace, where every allocation is done via sub-allocators. It enables us to control object placement at allocation time by selecting an appropriate sub-allocator according to different criteria, such as subspace characteristics and object collocation. It greatly facilitates implementing container data structures aware of the far-memory model. We develop an allocator based on the collective allocator abstraction by extending the C++ standard allocator for container data structures on the far-memory model and experimentally demonstrate that it facilitates implementing containers equipped with object placement strategies aware of spatial locality under the far-memory model in a high-level, modular manner. More specifically, we have successfully implemented B-trees and skip lists with the combined use of two placement strategies. The modifications therein for the original implementations are fairly modest: addition is mostly due to specifying object placement; deletion and modification are at most 1.2 % and 3.2 % of lines of the original code, respectively. We have experimentally confirmed that the modified implementations successfully have data layouts suppressing swapping. We forecast that the collective allocator abstraction would be a key to high-level integration with different memory hardware technologies because it straightforwardly accommodates new interfaces for subspaces."

Wearing *the right gloves under some circumstances* can be a safety benefit, rather than a potential danger.  Even while using rotating machinery.  In fact, it's a must in some circumstances.\n\n______________________________\nWhile I certainly advocate safety and well being, and I appreciate the sentiment that is being made, you guys are all hyperbolizing this glove issue tremendously.  Perhaps it should be said that if you are an amateur, or unfamiliar with safe, best practices and are not a regular user then by all means, take every precaution.  However, professionals, people who especially work outside building and maintaining the structures that you live in and work and play in wear gloves on a regular basis while they are cutting and assembling materials.    Maybe it's excessively cold out, or handling treated lumber all day, day in and day out.  Nobody should be handling treating lumber on a regular basis bare-handed.  There are all kinds of reasons why people who use tools on a daily basis wear gloves.   Safely, too.  I've been doing it for almost 20 years, and the only time I've ever hurt myself on a construction jobsite was with a chisel that would have been stopped if I had been wearing my gloves! \n\nI always use and recommend good quality gloves, of course, that fit well and don't have any fraying hanging things.  And for god's sake, keep your shit as far as possible from the blade!\n\nI don't use a blade guard on my tablesaw, either.  For shame.\n\n\n\nSwarley_Chaplin: You should still never wear gloves while operating a table saw, a guard is not necessary but using gloves is retarded. They are perfectly fine for job site use though, just not tablesaws. Spreading thoughts like this is how people new to woodworking lose all their fingers while operating equipment unsafely.\njmorrisweb: More important than a guard is a riving knife. Especially for someone new, as it limits the ability to create a kickback situation tho not entirely. I have gotten to the point of relying on it, once you push a piece through you no longer have to keep as much pressure on the side and can worry about the feed rate. Without it, I seem to have to hold the piece much more (I use two wood push sticks) I don't like keeping that amount of pressure, I am not quite leaning into it or anything but it's enough if the sticks got ate from under me I don't know if I would be maintaining a comfortable distance. \n\nThat said I could see something like vinyl gloves maybe(they rip easy) but that's pretty much it I rather touch treated lumber than lose a whole hand. Gloves and moving parts simply are not [OSHA](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3170.pdf) and it's only mentioned like 11 times there are also many reports of full hand or practically full hand amputations. I can see the argument of hands shouldn't be that close to the blade, I personally don't like to stack mistakes. I am sure compounded mistakes are how many freak accidents happen.\n"

It is ruggedised and sensitive enough to detect changes with different dome vent configurations, as well as slow local variations of the index of refraction in the UH88'' telescope tube. The instrument is portable enough that it can be used to locate sources of turbulence inside and around domes, but it can also be used in an operational setting without affecting observations to characterise the local optical turbulence responsible for dome seeing. Thus, it could be used in real-time observatory control systems to configure vents and air handlers to effectively reduce dome seeing.

Water works great, concrete, not so much\nKayakingtheredriver: Seems to me we have a ton of old coal mines that just need a reservoir built upstream of them. Put generators all throughout the main mine shaft, and use the rest of the mine as the downward reservoir. Pump water out during the day, when you want to store energy, let the water turn the generators in the night when you want to add that energy to the grid as it fills the mine back up. Hundreds if not thousands of mine shafts all over under ground to conveniently *hide* half of the process and take up far less room, and room is always far more a problem than cost or ability.\nNewSauerKraus: The water has to go somewhere after it drops.\nKayakingtheredriver: https://www.adv-geosci.net/45/45/2018/adgeo-45-45-2018-avatar-web.png\n\nThat is what all the tunnels in the mine are for.

Run pipes down the shaft to the end of the mine tunnels with topside pumps to bring the water back up.\nNewSauerKraus: So your solution is to pump water up while energy is cheap, and let it flow down at night?\nKayakingtheredriver: Yep, or just *use* on site wind or solar stations to run the pumps during the day converting it into energy that is more valuable when there isn't sun and less wind at night. It is efficient, and renewable and the costs to maintain/build are far lessened because old mines have done most of the excavation for you and can be had dirt cheap, compared to building a dam and 2 reservoirs.\nNewSauerKraus: It\u2019s much cheaper, easier, and cleaner to just use a damn instead of a mine.\nKayakingtheredriver: Lol, dams are *so* easy and cheap to build huh? I will concede this water would become caustic with all the mixed in coal dust over time, but cost and and ease of build (from all the environment impact studies, what effect it will have on the river, displacement, and on and on) are far in the mine shafts favor. The mine only needs a above ground reservoir. It doesn't need an upstream or down stream river, a downstream reservoir, or displacement of land owners up/down stream or the years necessary to build all of that plus the dam. Just an upstream tank, the piped turbines (that you have to build either way) and the pump station (that you would have to build either way). None of the rest. It would cost way less in time and money.\nDannyBlind: I disagree, check my other comment. Coal dust is way more dangerous than you'd think\n"

Each of these pathways is part of the main hydrothermal system and is connected to the main hydrothermal reservoir at depth. In both 2006 and 2008, around Dolomieu crater, based on our results, the hydrothermal activity sections are located between 2300 and 2500 m a.s.l., which correlate well with the elevation of the observed fumarole belt within the post-2007-collapse crater wall. Our results show that the depths of the local hydrothermal activity sections change substantially over the investigated period. Vertical displacement of the main potential generation area, associated withthese hydrothermal activity sections, is observed on the order of several hundred meters at the transition between the period of quiescence (1993--1997) and the resumption of eruptive activity in 1998 and 2007, respectively. From 1999 to March 2008, the hydrothermal system was consistently located at relatively shallow depths.By quantitatively determining the vertical displacement of hydrothermal fluids over 16 years, we identify a significant link between hydrothermal system and magmatic activity. Hydrothermal system depth below the surface is an indicator of the activity level (pressurization/depressurization of the volcano) within the shallowmagmatic systems. Thus, when used in conjunction with long term volcano monitoring, this approach can contribute substantially to detection of the precursory signals of changes in volcanic activity."

Used to be able to do loads of weighted exercises but injured myself due to bad form and was out for like 8 weeks so trina get back into the swing of things. \nU reckon this is hitting the majority of upper major muscle groups?\nlilsma333: If i were you i would tryout olympic dippushups on dumbells or somthin to elevate your hands, this is for lower pec isolation (lookup dumbell lower pec on youtube) its a 7/10 for me 8-9/10 if you do them perfect, dips are amazing for lower chest development and i noticed they built my whole chest great but at a certain point i almost tore my pec(ego liften my chest couodnt handle weight) and my mind muscle activation with my chest has not been the same since, not sure if anyone else has experienced this. Chestflys are also great for lower pec isolation but they are uncomfertable for me. I. think if i get my weighted pushup to an insane number for my weight(125ish) ill reach near my genetic potential for chest n tricep n frontal delt development but only time will tell. And your question about if this is hitting majority of major muscle groups yes i thinkso but lmk what you think i could improve because there's always room to improve. You could mess with sets and reps to fit your needs, swap high volume pullups for rows but tbh i really do think if you keep it simple and just get insanely strong at the upper callithenics compound movements and make every rep count you'll uncover alot of your genetic potential if you're consistent\nanonymoose-moose02: Mate really appreciate the help. Imma look into those dips. Do they have to be done on bars or something cus I don\u2019t have anywhere in my house that resembles a dip station?\n\nI think my main piece of advice which I\u2019ve learnt from injuring my lower back and still recovering is make sure every single rep has perfect form. And if you\u2019re near ur max and ur form is lacking don\u2019t do it it\u2019s not worth it trust me. Also very important to stretch to prevent this especially with weighted.\nlilsma333: You can use a walker(things for old people)for dips a counter top that makes a right angle it'll resemble this( L )or this (V ) also straightbar dips go hard and thanks bro you definetly saved me from lowerback pain because ive been ignoring some stuff when it comes to lower body, as for stretching ima educate myself on that to get effective stretching routines for the things that irritate me. ima go get that grind my guy peace wish u well in all that you do\nanonymoose-moose02: Seems like you\u2019re in the exact same position I was. If you do feel something don\u2019t keep working it cus that\u2019s how mine just got worse over time. Listen to you\u2019re body and take a couple days off. May hurt you\u2019re ego as it did mine but it\u2019ll be a lot better in the long run. Also see if you can buy some tiger balm online. Dunno if you\u2019ve heard about it but that shit does wonders for muscle relief and warming up the muscles. \nDefo educate yourself on stretching like I did. So so important\nWish you and you\u2019re family well bro stay safe and healthy and use all this time as best as we can\nlilsma333: \ud83d\udc99\n"

        "text": " program logic instead of the accidental complexity that comes from combining several technologies. While current tierless approaches therefore relieve the burden of having to combine different technologies into one application, the distribution of the code is explicitly tied into the program. Certain distribution decisions have an impact on crosscutting concerns such as information security or offline availability. Moreover, adapting the programs such that the application complies better with these concerns often leads to code tangling, rendering the program more difficult to understand and maintain. We introduce an approach to multi-tier programming where the tierless code is decoupled from the tier specification. The developer implements the web application in terms of slices and an external specification that assigns the slices to tiers. A recommender system completes the picture for those slices that do not have a fixed placement and proposes slice refinements as well. This recommender system tries to optimise the tier specification with respect to one or more crosscutting concerns. This is in contrast with current cutting edge solutions that hide distribution decisions from the programmer. In this paper we show that slices, together with a recommender system, enable the developer to experiment with different placements of slices, until the distribution of the code satisfies the programmer's needs. We present a search-based recommender system that maximises the offline availability of a web application and a concrete implementation of these concepts in the tier-splitting tool Stip.js."

This is one of the first examples of such a species in a biological system for which M{\\\"o}ssbauer parameters are now available: delta(/Fe) = 0.54 (1) mm/s, DeltaE(Q) = -0.80 (5) mm/s, and the asymmetry parameter eta = 0.60 (5) mm/s. The M{\\\"o}ssbauer and spin Hamiltonian parameters have been evaluated on a model from the side-on peroxo complex (model 2) issued from the oxidized iron center in SOR from Pyrococcus furiosus, for which structural data are available in the literature [Yeh et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 2499-2508]. For comparison, similar calculations have been carried out on a model derived from 2 (model 3), where the [CH(3)-S](1)(-) group has been replaced by the neutral [NH(3)](0) group [Neese and Solomon (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 12829-12848]. Both models 2 and 3 contain a formally high-spin Fe(3+) ion (i.e., with empty minority spin orbitals). We found, however, a significant fraction (approximately 0.6 for 2, approximately 0.8 for 3) of spin (equivalently charge) spread over two occupied (minority spin) orbitals. The quadrupole splitting value for 2 is found to be negative and matches quite well the experimental value. The computed quadrupole tensors are rhombic in the case of 2 and axial in the case of 3. This difference originates directly from the presence of the thiolate ligand in 2. A correlation between experimental isomer shifts for Fe(3+) mononuclear complexes with computed electron densities at the iron nucleus has been built and used to evaluate the isomer shift values for 2 and 3 (0.56 and 0.63 mm/s, respectively). A significant increase of isomer shift value is found upon going from a methylthiolate to a nitrogen ligand for the Fe(3+) ion, consistent with covalency effects due to the presence of the axial thiolate ligand. Considering that the isomer shift value for 3 is likely to be in the 0.61-0.65 mm/s range [Horner et al. (2002) Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., 3278-3283], the isomer shift value for a high-spin eta(2)-O(2) Fe(3+) complex with an axial thiolate group can be estimated to be in the 0.54-0.58 mm/s range. The occurrence of a side-on peroxo intermediate in SOR is discussed in relation to the recent data published for a side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) species in another biological system [Karlsson et al. (2003) Science 299, 1039-1042]."

        "text": " the team. The article provides three key contributions. First, we describe a role allocation technique that takes into account future uncertainties in the domain; prior work in multiagent role allocation has failed to address such uncertainties. To that end, we introduce RMTDP (Role-based Markov Team Decision Problem), a new distributed POMDP model for analysis of role allocations. Our technique gains in tractability by significantly curtailing RMTDP policy search; in particular, BDI team plans provide incomplete RMTDP policies, and the RMTDP policy search fills the gaps in such incomplete policies by searching for the best role allocation. Our second key contribution is a novel decomposition technique to further improve RMTDP policy search efficiency. Even though limited to searching role allocations, there are still combinatorially many role allocations, and evaluating each in RMTDP to identify the best is extremely difficult. Our decomposition technique exploits the structure in the BDI team plans to significantly prune the search space of role allocations. Our third key contribution is a significantly faster policy evaluation algorithm suited for our BDI-POMDP hybrid approach. Finally, we also present experimental results from two domains: mission rehearsal simulation and RoboCupRescue disaster rescue simulation."

Cause I thought that was it.\n\nHow would 'actual' free will actually show up? The entire universe goes about reacting mindlessly, but as soon as you get some gray matter into the equation, the laws of physics are suspended? It seems like a big assumption to make based on a personal impression.\n\n[deleted]: Actually having free will isn't just thinking you have free will. The example I use in my class is this: If I was a jedi master and I used the force on one of my students and made him say \"I really enjoy this class and I have made this decision freely\". He clearly wouldn't actually have free will.\n\n'Actual' free will enters the equation if you posit something like an immaterial soul *or* if you change the definition of freedom like the compatibilists do. I don't like either of these options, hence I am a determinism.\nschawt: I dunno, there's a difference between being a slave to a jedi's will and being a slave to your own will. You are a slave to your own will, but that, to me, is the same as being free; doing what you want to do. If you're a slave to someone else, then it kinda transitions into actual slavery right?\n\n\n[deleted]: Well for one person, what's the difference between being a slave to the laws of physics and being a slave to the jedi's will? In both cases, you think that you have free will, but in both cases you're actually entirely under the control of something other than your will.\n[deleted]: In determinism is there really any such thing as a 'will'?\n[deleted]: Depends on what you mean by \"will\" obviously. If you're talking about an immaterial force that \"emerges\" from an agent, then no.\n[deleted]: Well I figured that. I was just wondering what you, as the determinist, meant by will (I'm also a determinist). Maybe you meant sort of a desire?\nnooneelse: I would add a couple of things to \"desire\" before calling it \"will\".  Things along the lines of \"intention to act\", maybe something about the \"mental action of trying\", though that second one is in more sketchy terms.\n\nBut it seems clear that \"desire\" and \"will\" come apart.  I can desire something without willing to have it at all.  Indeed, I might have to exercise strong \"willpower\" to overcome a desire.  That could be countered with founding that willpower on a separate desire.  Which just leads me to the point that desires can obviously contradict each other, and we still say that we have each of the desires that contradicts the others.  I don't think that kind of dynamic is ever said of the will.\n[deleted]: agreed. I don't know why I just mentioned 'desire'. I feel like a complete tool. Obviously there are other things, such as intention to act and all that.\n"

The depth of the influence from Buddhism on local religious beliefs can be seen in much of Shinto's conceptual vocabulary and even the types of Shinto shrines seen today. The large worship halls and religious images are themselves of Buddhist origin. The formal separation of Buddhism from Shinto took place only as recently as the end of the 19th century; however, in many ways, the blending of the two still continues.\nThe term shinbutsu sh\u016bg\u014d itself was coined during the early modern era (17th century) to refer to the amalgamation of kami and buddhas in general, as opposed to specific currents within Buddhism which did the same, e.g. Ry\u014dbu Shint\u014d and Sann\u014d Shint\u014d. The term may have a negative connotation of bastardization and randomness. It is a yojijukugo phrase.\n\n"

Barrow, which is intended to categorize the development stage of extraterrestrial civilizations, it would be conceivable that advanced civilizations do not claim more and more space and resources, but optimize their already available space increasingly, for example by building a matrioshka brain consisting of several layers of computronium around their star.\nIn the 2010 film The Singularity Is Near: A True Story About the Future, American futurist Ray Kurzweil discusses a universe filled with computronium. He believes this could be possible as early as the late 22nd century and would be accomplished by sending intelligent nanobots through the universe faster than light, e.g. by using wormholes. According to him, such an endeavor would have the potential to prevent the natural ending of the universe.\nIn addition, the term computronium is used in connection with science fiction narratives."

The weak-coupling approach potentially reconciles the simplicity of the Constituent Quark Model with the complexities of Quantum Chromodynamics. The penalty for achieving this perturbative picture is the necessity of formulating the dynamics of QCD in light-front coordinates and of dealing with the complexities of renormalization which such a formulation entails. We describe the renormalization process first using a qualitative phase space cell analysis, and we then set up a precise similarity renormalization scheme with cutoffs on constituent momenta and exhibit calculations to second order. We outline further computations that remain to be carried out. There is an initial nonperturbative but nonrelativistic calculation of the hadronic masses that determines the artificial potential, with binding energies required to be fourth order in the coupling as in QED. Next there is a calculation of the leading radiative corrections to these masses, which requires our renormalization program. Then the real struggle of finding the right extensions to perturbation theory to study the strong-coupling behavior of bound states can begin."

Some clues are given about the influence, on the playing frequency and on the dynamic of the sound, of two main parameters of the geometrical model: the size of the volume and the level of the excitation. It is shown that the playing frequency of a (+,-) reed can vary in a large range according to the size of the volume upstream of the reed; that the playing frequency is nearly independent of the excitation but that the dynamic of the sound increases with the excitation level. Some clues are also proposed to determine the nature of the bifurcation for free reeds: it seems that free reeds may present inverse bifurcations. The influence of the reed thickness is also studied for configurations where the reed length or the reed width vary to keep the mass constant. This study shows that the reed thickness can have a great influence on the sound magnitude, the playing frequency and the magnitude of the reed displacement which justifies its introduction in the reed model.This article has been published in Acta Acustica united with Acustica, Vol. 93 (2007), p. 122-144."

The PEDOT is polymerized on each side and forms an interpenetrating network with the two other polymers. A pseudo trilayer is obtained, the two outer layers containing the PEDOT acting as electrodes. It is then saturated with an ionic liquid. When the blade thus obtained is placed in an electric field orthogonal to its faces, the PEDOT undergoes a reduction reaction (or dedoping) on the side of the negative electrode, which attracts cations from the central part and therefore swells ; the blade ultimately bends towards the positive electrode.We have first adapted our model to this two-components system : the cations on the one hand, and the three polymers and the anions on the other hand. We have written its balance equations and thermodynamic relations first at the microscopic scale for each phase, then at the macroscopic scale for the whole material using an averaging technique. The thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes then provides its constitutive relations : a Kelvin - Voigt type stress-strain relation and generalized Fourier's and Darcy's laws. The equations obtained were applied to the case of a cantilevered blade subject to a continuous potential difference at constant temperature. The numerical resolution of the equations system enabled us to draw the profiles of the different quantities, which are very steep functions near the electrodes. We also evaluated the tip displacement and the force that must be exerted on the free end of the beam to prevent its displacement (blocking force). The results obtained are in good agreement with the experimental data published in the literature."

Concrete hm? Is it heavier than sand per cubic unit though? And do you think it'd work for deadlifts?\nklew3: Average unit weight of concrete is 150pcf (lbs/cubic foot) while sands typically are about 120pcf. Source - bachelor's in civil engineering. Sand will be denser if compacted and/or well graded (lots of different grain sizes) which maximizes volume occupied by the material. \n\nThat said concrete is the result of hydrated cement with some sort of aggregate like sand, gravel, etc. The aggregate adds or reduces bulk and weight depending on what you use. Cement is a dry powder that reacts with water to form the binder in concrete. I have no idea off the top of my head what cement weighs. Sorry if somewhat useless for this convo. Quickcrete is I believe a brand of cement, can't remember if it has aggregate in it or not. \n\nEdit: Quickcrete does have sand and gravel.\nkadoodledum: Wow. TIL about concrete and different densities. Cool. But out of practicality, sand would be the best option in a duffel bag? I don't see how concrete can be used in a bag without being awkward to use. \nklew3: Yeah I imagine sand is the best option as it contours to your body and is relatively inexpensive especially if you have decent sand around where you live that's free for the taking.\n"

We first discuss the relations between the clique-interval number and other graph invariants such as the classic interval number of graphs, the treewidth, the {\\em VC-dimension} and the {\\em stabbing number} of a related hypergraph. Then, in part based on these above relations, we almost completely settle the complexity of diameter computation on these subclasses of split graphs: - For the $k$-clique-interval split graphs, we can compute their diameter in truly subquadratic time if $k={\\cal O}(1)$, and even in quasi linear time if $k=o(\\log{n})$ and in addition a corresponding ordering of the vertices in the clique is given. However, under SETH this cannot be done in truly subquadratic time for any $k = \\omega(\\log{n})$. - For the {\\em complements} of $k$-clique-interval split graphs, we can compute their diameter in truly subquadratic time if $k={\\cal O}(1)$, and even in time ${\\cal O}(km)$ if a corresponding ordering of the vertices in the stable set is given. Again this latter result is optimal under SETH up to polylogarithmic factors. Our findings raise the question whether a $k$-clique interval ordering can always be computed in quasi linear time. We prove that it is the case for $k=1$ and for some subclasses such as bounded-treewidth split graphs, threshold graphs and comparability split graphs.

It has been shown that while keeping weekly volume the same, if you trained more frequently (e.g daily, instead of 3/week) strength gains were slightly higher and muscle gain was noticeably higher.\n\nsays nothing about it more taxing on recovery\n-RandomPoem-: you're ignoring the rest of that write up, and just focusing on the benefits of greasing the groove rather than what might be the most effective style of workout\n"

Egypt lasted longer than most empires, no?\n\nI feel like we weren't taught as much about the Egyptian timeline (not a history major)\narabic513: I\u2019m not a history expert and I\u2019d be interested to know the criteria of civilization vs empire. Rome is considered the longest empire (1200+ years), but Egypt is considered the longest civilization (3000+) \n\nRegardless though, the timescale of ancient Egypt and their civilization completely eclipse modern civilization.\ntwisted_meta: I might be able to answer this based on what I\u2019ve learned taking anthropology courses. Civilization is basically the highest order in a 5 tier ranking system for a society. Basically in order to be considered a civilization there needs to be a high level of social stratification, employment specialization, urban centers, and a writing system. A civilization can also be an empire but an empire doesn\u2019t need to be  full scale civilization. New World empires like the Olmec and Toltec are good examples of an empire that was not a civilization because they did not have written language and had tribal big man politics. Rome is the definition of a civilization that is also an empire\u2026in this context Egypt should be considered both as their military might allowed for territorial gains under a single centralized power.\nScac_ang_gaoic: But they didn't have such centralized power?\ntwisted_meta: Centralized power meaning the Pharaoh and his court\nScac_ang_gaoic: I was thinking of the pharaoh's, I guess I mentally inserted an *if* a centralized power existed to the statement.\n\nStill don't understand why Egypt wouldn't be on modern day history's lists for longest lasting empire.  Is it just territory size?\nJaooooooooooooooooo: Because it wasn't a singular empire for all that time. The central government collapsed on many occasions and they were rules by other empires as well.\n\nFor example, the Ptolemaic dynasty, which Cleopatra was part of, were Greek descendants of a companion of Alexander the Great (Ptolemy I)\nScac_ang_gaoic: Incredible.

By 1975 the Soviet Union had crept up to somewhere between 40 percent and 60 percent of the American level of GNP\n\n&gt; \u2026\n\n&gt; They realized that the USSR as presently constituted simply could not match a United States that was both a rich consumer society and a global superpower. In the 1970s Gorbachev (then a high apparatchik) was taken to a Canadian supermarket, a cathedral of consumption. He was impressed but suspected a fake Potemkin village stocked for his benefit. He asked his driver to stop unscheduled at a second supermarket. It was just as abundant. Capitalism was a success and the cadres knew it. Their historic aspiration for world leadership sagged.\n\nAccording to *Sources*, the early days of industrialization and military buildup were very successful, bringing high economic growth and especially education. But productivity was always modest due to lacking incentives. And once they had more or less caught up in basic industry, it turned out that central control was not effective for developing a prosperous consumer economy. Inefficient state enterprises don\u2019t go bankrupt, and producers have neither the incentives nor the freedom to create fashionable jeans and avocado toast.\nDrSlightlyLessDoom: Foucault did much better work in describing how power works and is wielded than Mann ever did.

Trust me when I say it will have a tremendous affect on your emotions, your paranoia and anxiety, your thoughts in general, everything about what makes you who you are.\n\nIt's not that only confident, relaxed, chill, awesome people did sports in high school and all that shit. They became that way because they were more active, and being active a lot, depending on the intensity of their physical activities, altered their brain chemistry to give them that kind of confidence and relaxation around large groups of people. It's not the sole factor of course, it's not like every person that exercises and trains a lot becomes a Jersey Shore douche, or Arnold Schwarzenegger, or like Shaq, or any particular athletic celebrity personality. You will still be uniquely you, with all your likes and dislikes being relatively the same, with new interests possibly, except yea you will be more like a confident, more mature, energetic, adult-you.\n\nYou will be less stressed and anxious, you will be more comfortable just talking to people, you'll start feeling like you're in a different state of mind where everything isn't all up in your face and prickling your nerves with anxiety darts and shit. \n\nI used to be afraid of random people at restaurants watching me eat, and one time a cute girl my age sat at a table across from me, and I could not eat the whole time even though she pretty much never looked at me. That's just the tip of the iceberg of how socially anxious and awkward I was. Now I work at one of the most popular casinos, and before that I was a salesmen at a very very high volume sporting goods store, and a teenage fashion clothing store. I made love to a woman the first night we met off Tinder, and we meet up a few times a week now, and it's awesome.\n\nMy social anxiety is pretty much gone. The only time I'm ever socially anxious is when one of the directors of the casino walks in and asks me something, but only on weeks where I feel like I haven't been doing my best.\n\nSo take it from me, find a chance whenever you can each night to do some very slow moderate to heavy lifting, a little meditation and relaxation, and talk to people with certain thoughts in mind that remind you to stop taking every little moment so seriously and just relax and enjoy these moments, especially when you are talking to a beautiful woman, and don't worry about them judging you every single second and trying to always look the best, smell the best, and say the best things. As long as you are putting in somewhat effort to wear clean clothes and shower, and talk with a moderate smile on your face, instead of looking like you are so sad and lifeless that you wanna die (smiling is 100x more attractive than frowning, go ahead and take a picture of yourself doing both faces), you will do just fine.\n\nAnyways yea, go talk to her, and practice those de-stressing techniques.\njtw97: Epic comment.\n"

Combining only SDSS LRG and WMAP data places robust constraints on many cosmological parameters that complement prior analyses of multiple data sets. The LRGs provide independent cross-checks on Om and the baryon fraction in good agreement with WMAP. Within the context of flat LCDM models, our LRG measurements complement WMAP by sharpening the constraints on the matter density, the neutrino density and the tensor amplitude by about a factor of two, giving Omega_m=0.24+-0.02 (1 sigma), sum m_nu < 0.9 eV (95%) and r<0.3 (95%). Baryon oscillations are clearly detected and provide a robust measurement of the comoving distance to the median survey redshift z=0.35 independent of curvature and dark energy properties. Within the LCDM framework, our power spectrum measurement improves the evidence for spatial flatness, sharpening the curvature constraint Omega_tot=1.05+-0.05 from WMAP alone to Omega_tot=1.003+-0.010. Assuming Omega_tot=1, the equation of state parameter is constrained to w=-0.94+-0.09, indicating the potential for more ambitious future LRG measurements to provide precision tests of the nature of dark energy. All these constraints are essentially independent of scales k>0.1h/Mpc and associated nonlinear complications, yet agree well with more aggressive published analyses where nonlinear modeling is crucial."

This is due to the high seismic vulnerability of the buildings due to the absence of mandatory seismic regulation until 2012, the high level of urbanization, and the lack of adequate spatial planning and risk prevention policies. Beirut as the main residential, economic and institutional hub of Lebanon is densely populated. To accommodate the growing need for urban development, constructions have almost taken over all of the green areas of the city; squares and gardens are disappearing to give place to skyscrapers. However, open spaces are safe places to shelter, away from debris, and therefore play an essential role in earthquake evacuation. Despite the massive urbanization, there are a few open spaces but locked gates and other types of anthropogenic barriers often limit their access. To simulate this complex context, pedestrians' evacuation simulations are run in a highly realistic spatial environment implemented in GAMA [1]. Previous data concerning soil and buildings in Beirut [2, 3] are complemented by new geographic data extracted from high-resolution Pleiades satellite images. The seismic loading is defined as a peak ground acceleration of 0.3g, as stated in Lebanese seismic regulations. Building damages are estimated using an artificial neural network trained to predict the mean damage [4] based on the seismic loading as well as the soil and building vibrational properties [5]. Moreover, the quantity and the footprint of the generated debris around each building are also estimated and included in the model. We simulate how topography, buildings, debris, and access to open spaces, affect individuals' mobility. Two city configurations are implemented: 1. Open spaces are accessible without any barriers; 2. Access to some open spaces is blocked. The first simulation results show that while 52% of the population is able to arrive to an open space within 5 minutes after an earthquake, this number is reduced to 39% when one of the open spaces is locked. These results show that the presence of accessible open spaces in a city and their proximity to the residential buildings is a crucial factor for ensuring people's safety when an earthquake occurs."

Because of that, the Polish tactical counter-offensive was repelled. The following day, the Russian division expanded the gap, broke through to the other side of the front and managed to drive approximately 15 kilometres towards the rear of the Polish forces.\nThis created a gap in the Polish front and endangered the rear of the Polish 13th division. The commander of the Polish 6th Army, Gen. Wac\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz, ordered a counter-assault group to be created out of all available reserves. The group, commanded by Jerzy Sawicki, was composed of two regiments of his 3rd Cavalry Brigade, as well as two infantry battalions from the 19th Infantry Regiment and two batteries of field artillery. The Polish counter-assault started at 1 o'clock in the night of 1 June 1920. The Poles caught the 11th Cavalry Division by surprise in the village of Staro\u015bci\u0144ce.

The aim of the present paper is to study the behaviour of such constructions when we make a change of local coordinate near the origin. We consider the case of \\ $[\\lambda]-$primitive frescos, which are monogenic geometric (a,b)-modules corresponding to a minimal filtered differential equation associated to a relative de Rham cohomology class on \\ $X$ \\ (see [B.09-a] and [B.09-b]). An holomorphic parameter is a function on the set of isomorphism classes of frescos which behave holomorphically in an holomorphic family of frescos. In general, an holomorphic parameter is not invariant by a change of variable, but we prove a theorem of stability of holomorphic families of frescos by a change of variable and it implies that an holomorphic parameter gives again an holomorphic parameter by a change of variable. We construct here two different kinds of holomorphic parameters which are (quasi-)invariant by change of variable. The first kind is associated to Jordan blocks of the monodromy with size at least two. The second kind is associated to the semi-simple part of the monodromy and look like some \"cross ratio\" of eigenvectors. They allow, in the situation describe above, to associate to a given (vanishing) relative de Rham cohomology class some numbers, which will depend holomorphically of our data, and are independant of the choice of the local coordinate near \\ $0$ \\ to study the Gauss-Manin connection of this degeneration of compact complex manifolds."

On a local scale, for all charged pectins, a correlation peak appears at 0.2 {\\AA}-1 due to proteins clustering inside the complexes. On a large scale, the complexes appear as formed of spherical globules with a well defined radius of 10 to 50 nm, containing a few thousands proteins. The volume fraction Phi of organic matter within the globules derived from SANS absolute cross-sections is around 0.1. The protein stacking, which occurs inside the globules, is enhanced when pectin is more charged, due to pH or DM. The linear charge density of the pectin determines the size of the globules for pectin chains of comparable molecular weights whether it is controlled by the pH or the DM. The radius of the globules varies between 10 nm and 50 nm. In conclusion the structure is driven by electrostatic interactions and not by hydrophobic interactions. The molecular weight also has a large influence on the structure of the complexes since long chains tend to form larger globules. This maybe one reason why DM and pH are not completely equivalent in our system since DM 0 has a short mass, but this may not be the only one. For very low pectin charge (-/+ = 0.07), globules do not appear and the scattering signals a gel-like structure. We did not observe any beads-on-a-string structure."

However, there are other fundamental differences between current DL systems and human learning, as well as technical ingredients to fill this gap, that are either superficially, or not adequately, discussed by Lake et al. These fundamental mechanisms relate to autonomous development and learning. They are bound to play a central role in artificial intelligence in the future. Current DL systems require engineers to manually specify a task-specific objective function for every new task, and learn through off-line processing of large training databases. On the contrary, humans learn autonomously open-ended repertoires of skills, deciding for themselves which goals to pursue or value, and which skills to explore, driven by intrinsic motivation/curiosity and social learning through natural interaction with peers. Such learning processes are incremental, online, and progressive. Human child development involves a progressive increase of complexity in a curriculum of learning where skills are explored, acquired, and built on each other, through particular ordering and timing. Finally, human learning happens in the physical world, and through bodily and physical experimentation, under severe constraints on energy, time, and computational resources.

The resolution was poorly worded and the lawyer present had some misunderstandings so\u2026. Inevitably there\u2019s gonna have to be some interpretation. In the case of a board resolution not being clear school principals would either a) be told what to do from the superintendent ,or b) make their own decisions as to what they think the board was trying to do. I.e., remove from classrooms or remove from all school facilities.\n\n~~Whichever way it shook out, there are no longer any copies of Maus in the McMinn County schools \u2014 you can check the catalogs online at mcminnschools.follettdestiny.com.~~  [Edit: Thanks to research by /u/SinisterStiturgeon, we now know Maus has been returned to the library shelves at the High School level.]\n\nSo while it may not have been \"banned\" from the school libraries depending on how you parse the word... it is no longer available to students.\nimpendingaff1: I am still also not finding it moved to another grade but two people (on reddit of course) are claiming to have first hand knowledge and say it is in the 9th. I am still looking for a decent source.\nMakgraf: /u/rmosquito literally linked you to the actual motion removing Maus from the schools and /u/polr13 linked you to the school board's statement defending doing so. Is it your contention that the board, which is getting massive international blowback for their decision, is nevertheless lying for some reason? What more evidence do you need to convince you that some random redditor is not necessarily true?\nimpendingaff1: Not the board, as lying, but the media as misrepresenting the facts. I am trying to find definitive evidence one way or the other.  And Yes. Those links help.\nMakgraf: /u/rmosquito and /u/polr13 are not linking you to what \"the media\" is saying, they are linking to the school board's own website (if you want to see where /u/rmosquito got his/her PDF from scroll down to the bottom of https://www.mcminnschools.com/browse/213674 and click on \"Called Meeting Minutes 1-10-22\").\n\nNow, you would agree that the school board is getting massive international blowback for its decision, right? If the random redditor is right and the book was simply moved to grade 9, then why wouldn't the school board say so in its statement? Of course it would. There is no \"media\" intermediary involved here.\npolr13: Whelp and there it went. Looks like OP deleted the post. Appreciate you fighting for the delta for us, though.\nMakgraf: Very welcome!\n"

There was also in the preceeding 60 years a series of movements mostly by displaced and persecuted Jews to the Palestinian region. Prior to the creation of Isreal, Palestine was under control of the British, not the US or even themselves, and the creation of Israel was timed to be at the end of British rule. There was also the issue of what to do with all the displaced Jews all around the world, where would be the safe place for them to live, and that was something that was talked about within the League of Nations prior to the creation of Israel.\n\nFor your question, you might want to put it into a specific context. Are you wondering whether it moral right now to continue, or was it moral to create it in the first place? You could get answers far ranging, from comparisons to why it is OK for the US to still occupy Native American land or not, to the idea that the League of Nations was just doing its best under the circumstances, and what they hoped was best for all people involved.\nmanolo458: Appreciate the comparison that you made with US occupying Native American land. Gives me something to think about. Thanks man. \n812many: No problem. As a (former) Jew, I've done a lot of thinking about the morality of what's going on in Israel, and would love to debate/read about a debate about it. I personally don't like the US carte blanche approach with Isreal, and I'm also not a fan of the general view by the current Palestinian government (Hamas) that all the Jews should be wiped into the sea. I can see why the Israelis have a hard time negotiating with them, however their approach of trying to build cities and slowly take over Palestinian claimed land (1967 boarders) by having entrenched populations while specifically not negotiating is a really dick move, and only enrages a people who are slowly getting squeezed.\n\nIn the immortal words of Rodney King, \"Can't we all just get along?\"\n\nedit: see, just like talking about it, even though i've gone on my own tangent only partially related to your question :)\n"

As the Wasserstein space (P(D), W\\_2) is positively curved in the sense of Alexandrov we cannot apply the theory of Koorevaar, Schoen and Jost and we use instead arguments based on optimal transport. We manage to get existence of harmonic mappings provided that the boundary values are Lipschitz on d Omega, uniqueness is an open question. If Omega is a segment of R, it is known that a curve valued in the Wasserstein space P(D) can be seen as a superposition of curves valued in D. We show that it is no longer the case in higher dimensions: a generic mapping Omega -> P(D) cannot be represented as the superposition of mappings Omega -> D. We are able to show the validity of a maximum principle: the composition F(mu) of a function F : P(D) -> R convex along generalized geodesics and a harmonic mapping mu : Omega -> P(D) is a subharmonic real-valued function. We also study the special case where we restrict ourselves to a given family of elliptically contoured distributions (a finite-dimensional and geodesically convex submanifold of (P(D), W\\_2) which generalizes the case of Gaussian measures) and show that it boils down to harmonic mappings valued in the Riemannian manifold of symmetric matrices endowed with the distance coming from optimal transport."

Any other suggestions?\n[deleted]: I think humidity damage is inevitable but you can take steps to minimize and reduce the damage.\n\n* Proper flooring.   A nice tile or vinyl floor is going to be much more resistant than wood floor.\n\n\n* Drywall - It will probably be fine as long as it's well painted.   You may want to re-paint and seal the drywall once a year with a bathroom rated paint.\n\n* Ventilation - I would install a bathroom style fan that's rated for at least as many sq feet as your room and perhaps it's a good idea to oversize it.   Remember, for an exhaust fan you'll also need a place for fresh air to come in.   Have this fan on a timer.   Run it whenever the cover is off the tub and for 30-60 minutes after you put the cover on.\n\n* More? - If water is going to be splashing directly on any drywall, it's probably not good.  Replace this drywall with tile, or something more resistant to moisture.\nIf you wanted to go real fancy you could finish much of the room in cedar like a sauna.   \n\n* Caulking - If you anticipate lots of water on the floor, or on any place it might be wise to caulk places where the water might run.  I'm thinking like along the baseboards.\n\n* Cleaning - Keep the place clean.  Mop up any standing water on the floor when you're done.\n\n\nI think with some common sense you should have few problems.\n \nxanderrobar: Thank you! This is some great advice. I hadn't considered that most solutions designed for bathrooms should similarly work for this hot tub room. \nthews: These are all good ideas, but definitely add some extra foundation where the hot tub will be.  And it would be best to tile the floor with enough slope to push water into a drain spot.  You wouldn't necessarily have to drain it into the sewer,  putting a P pipe on it and letting it slope off outside somewhere where it won't mess up the foundation would be okay.\nxanderrobar: Is [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_%28plumbing%29) what you mean when you say \"P Pipe\"? I would definietely have to do what you're suggesting, as this building has no water running to it. It has a fully separate electrical panel and a natural gas line with gas heater, but no water (and therefore no drainage into the sewer very easily). \nyoda2088: Afraid to click the link.\nheaded4thecrapper: p-pipe or a p-trap is just a p-shaped piece of pipe that holds water to prevent sewer gasses from coming out.\n\nMight be good to tile the whole damn thing and put a floor drain in the middle so that any standing water has somewhere to go?\n"

To optimize the contrast conditions, both hydrogenated and deuterated monomers have been used for the synthesis. A refined fitting analysis based on the comparison on two models, a basic core-shell and the Gaussian Pedersen model, enables us to fit nicely the experimental data for both the hydrogenated and deuterated grafted case. Differences are seen between grafting of normal or deuterated chains which can be due to monomer reactivity or to neutron contrast effect variations. The synthesis and the characterization method established in this work constitute a robust and reproducible way to design well defined grafted polymer nanoparticles. These objects will be incorporated in polymer matrices in a further step to create Nanocomposites for polymer reinforcement."

This means that Lp provides a mechanism for integrating statistical information and reasoning about uncertainty into systems based solely on logic. Second, Lp possesses transparent semantics, based on sets and probabilities of those sets. Hence, knowledge represented in Lp can be understood in terms of the simple primative concepts of sets and probabilities. And finally, the there is a sound proof theory that has wide coverage (the proof theory is complete for certain classes of models). The proof theory captures a sufficient range of valid inferences to subsume most previous probabilistic uncertainty reasoning systems. For example, the linear constraints like those generated by Nilsson's probabilistic entailment [2] can be generated by the proof theory, and the Bayesian inference underlying belief nets [8] can be performed. In addition, the proof theory integrates quantitative and qualitative reasoning as well as statistical and logical reasoning. In the next section we briefly examine previous work in probability logics, comparing it to Lp. Then we present some of the varieties of statistical information that Lp is capable of expressing. After this we present, briefly, the syntax, semantics, and proof theory of the logic. We conclude with a few examples of knowledge representation and reasoning in Lp, pointing out the advantages of the declarative representation offered by Lp. We close with a brief discussion of probabilities as degrees of belief, indicating how such probabilities can be generated from statistical knowledge encoded in Lp.

The book rejects the conception of production as a surplus, which owes much to Sraffa's theory of production prices, and is shown to be severely flawed. It founds the equivalence of commodities at the level of a production process considered as a transformation process. It rehabilitates the labor theory of value, based on the connection between money and labor due the monetary payment of wages, which allows the homogenization of various kinds of concrete labor into abstract labor. It shows that value is then a dimension of commodities and that this dimension is time, i.e. the time of physics. On this background, the book shows that the calculation of values for all commodities is always possible, even in the case of joint production, and that there cannot be any commodity residue left by this calculation. As a further step, this book provides a coherent theory of the realization of the product, which occurs in the circulation process. Using an idea - the widow's cruse - introduced by Keynes in his Treatise on Money, it brings to light the mechanism behind the transformation of money values into money prices and of surplus-value into profits and other transfer incomes, ensuring the formation of monetary profits. The book sheds some light on the rate of profit, its determinants and its evolution, showing in particular the paramount importance of capitalist consumption as one of its main determinants. In passing it explains the reasons why in the real world there is a multiplicity of profit rates. Finally, it allows to solve in a precise and illustrated way the problems raised by the Marxist law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Most of the results obtained translate into principles, the first ones being truly basic, the following ones less basic, but all of them being fundamental. All in all, this book might provide the first building blocks to develop a full-fledged and scientific economic theory to many fellow economists, critical of neo-classical theory, but who have not yet dicovered the bases of a complete and coherent alternative."

        "text": " system is maximized. However, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging due to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows exponentially with the number of agents involved. To date, therefore, many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem using different techniques ranging from dynamic programming, to integer programming, to stochastic search all of which suffer from major limitations relating to execution time, solution quality, and memory requirements. With this in mind, we develop an anytime algorithm to solve the coalition structure generation problem. Specifically, the algorithm uses a novel representation of the search space, which partitions the space of possible solutions into sub-spaces such that it is possible to compute upper and lower bounds on the values of the best coalition structures in them. These bounds are then used to identify the sub-spaces that have no potential of containing the optimal solution so that they can be pruned. The algorithm, then, searches through the remaining sub-spaces very efficiently using a branch-and-bound technique to avoid examining all the solutions within the searched subspace(s). In this setting, we prove that our algorithm enumerates all coalition structures efficiently by avoiding redundant and invalid solutions automatically. Moreover, in order to effectively test our algorithm we develop a new type of input distribution which allows us to generate more reliable benchmarks compared to the input distributions previously used in the field. Given this new distribution, we show that for 27 agents our algorithm is able to find solutions that are optimal in 0.175% of the time required by the fastest available algorithm in the literature. The algorithm is anytime, and if interrupted before it would have normally terminated, it can still provide a solution that is guaranteed to be within a bound from the optimal one. Moreover, the guarantees we provide on the quality of the solution are significantly better than those provided by the previous state of the art algorithms designed for this purpose. For example, for the worst case distribution given 25 agents, our algorithm is able to find a 90% efficient solution in around 10% of time it takes to find the optimal solution."

In the original scheme, the agreement condition is actually required to hold for all individual estimators, which appears inadequate if there is one bad initial estimator. In practice, a few disagreements are allowed ; for establishing the theoretical results, the proportion of estimators satisfying the condition is required to tend to 1. In this paper, we propose an alternative procedure, mixing the previous consensus ideas on the predictions with the Euclidean distance computed between entries. This may be seen as an alternative approach allowing to reduce the effect of a possibly bad estimator in the initial list, using a constraint on the inputs. We prove the consistency of our strategy in classification and in regression. We also provide some numerical experiments on simulated and real data to illustrate the benefits of this new aggregation method. On the whole, our practical study shows that our method may perform much better than the original combination technique, and, in particular, exhibit far less variance. We also show on simulated examples that this procedure mixing inputs and outputs is still robust to high dimensional inputs."

We also enunciated a conjecture for the fourth virial coefficient of the unitary spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas,inspired from the known analytical form of the third cluster coefficient and involving the integral over the imaginary $s$-axis of $s$ times the logarithmic derivative of the determinant of $M(s)$ summed over all angular momenta.The conjectured value is in contradiction with the experimental results."

On the contrary, Part III describes purely pdes approaches which are inspired by the literature on Hamilton Jacobi Equations on networks and which can handle the case of non-convex Hamiltonians. In this part, we present two notions of solutions, namely flux-limited and junction viscosity solutions, and we study in detail their properties by providing comparison and stability results. We also show that they are ``almost'' equivalent when both make sense, i.e. for quasi-convex Hamiltonians. Part IV concerns stratified problems in $\\R^N$, i.e. problems with discontinuities of any co-dimensions: the main change compared to the previous version is the introduction of a notion of ``weak'' stratified (sub)solution.

As a general result, the amplitudes of oscillations in the rotation appear to be small, and their determination from spaceborne techniques will be challenging. For example, the amplitudes of the semi-annual and annual nutations are around ~364 and ~140 milli-arcseconds, and they show little variation within the parametric space of interior models envisioned for Ceres. This, combined with the very long-period of the precession motion, requires very precise measurements. We also estimate the timescale for Ceres' orientation to relax to a generalized Cassini State, and we find that the tidal dissipation within that object was probably too small to drive any significant damping of its obliquity since formation. However, combining the shape and gravity observations by Dawn offers the prospect to identify departures of non-hydrostaticity at the global and regional scale, which will be instrumental in constraining Ceres' past and current thermal state. We also discuss the existence of a possible Chandler mode in the rotational motion of Ceres, whose potential excitation by endogenic and/or exogenic processes may help detect the presence of liquid reservoirs within the asteroid."

A near-concentric Fabry-P\\'{e}rot optical cavity focuses and resonantly enhances the power of the laser beam in order to achieve the high intensity required to provide the phase shift. We demonstrate that the cavity can surpass this requirement and generate a record-high continuous-wave laser intensity of $590 \\, \\mathrm{GW}/\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. By integrating the cavity into a transmission electron microscope, we show that the ponderomotive potential of the laser beam applies a spatially selective phase shift to the electron beam. This enables us to make the first experimental observation of the relativistic reversal of the ponderomotive potential. We then theoretically analyze the properties of the contrast transfer function generated by the laser phase plate. We experimentally determine that resolution loss caused by thermal magnetic field noise emanating from electrically conductive materials in the cavity can be eliminated by designing the cavity with a sufficiently large electron beam aperture. Finally, we show that the laser phase plate provides a stable $\\pi/2$ phase shift and concomitant contrast enhancement when imaging frozen hydrated biological macromolecules. We use these images to successfully determine the structure of the molecules.

I think a girlfriend can be that person, but I also feel like friends can also fill that role. \n\nObviously friends can\u2019t provide sex, so there\u2019s that caveat.

Emotionally though, it might be comparable.\n\nWhat would it look like to be emotionally intimate with someone? Is that something you could try with a friend?\n[deleted]: Well I guess I could be emotionally intimate with a friend.

For me, girlfriends are a subsection of friends, meaning if finding friends is hard, then finding a girlfriend will be even harder. I\u2019ve met people who were great friends but terrible as SOs. I\u2019ve never met anyone who was a great SO but a bad friend.\n\nI do believe that if you meet a friend who cares about you, then you\u2019ll feel a lot happier and readier to look for a girlfriend.\n"

The fundamental frequency is estimated at 0.33 Hz (SH wave) and the agreement with previous experimental results (spectral ratios) is good. Comparisons between 1D and 2D amplification are then performed: the values of the fundamental frequency and the corresponding amplitude are larger in 2D. Converting frequency domain results into the time domain, we underline surface waves generated at the valley edges and the directivity effect for the amplified wave-field. In the time domain for plane SV-wave, we also computed the ground motion for a strong seismic event (M=6): time duration and peak ground velocity are found to be 3 times larger than for the input signal. Such 2D models involving basin effects are then capable to recover the high amplification level measured in the field. Nevertheless, to deal with complex 3D basins as also proposed in the \"ESG\" benchmark [21-23], the capabilities of the classical Boundary Element Method are limited. As shown recently [43,47,52], such improvements as the fast multipole formulation (FM-BEM) may be a promising alternative for future 3D simulations."

A significant fraction (about 43~per cent) of the total detected \\ion{H}{i} mass of $1.5 \\times 10^{9}~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ resides within the extended outer disc. We fitted a tilted ring model to the velocity field of NGC~300 to derive the rotation curve out to a radius of $18.4~\\mathrm{kpc}$, almost twice the range of previous rotation curve studies. The rotation curve rises to a maximum velocity of almost $100~\\mathrm{km \\, s}^{-1}$ and then gently decreases again in the outer disc beyond a radius of about $10~\\mathrm{kpc}$. Mass models fitted to the derived rotation curve yield good fits for Burkert and NFW dark matter halo models, whereas pseudo-isothermal halo models and MOND-based models both struggle to cope with the declining rotation curve. We also observe significant asymmetries in the outer \\ion{H}{i} disc of NGC~300, in particular near the edge of the disc, which are possibly due to ram pressure stripping of gas by the intergalactic medium (IGM) of the Sculptor group. Our estimates show that ram pressure stripping can occur under reasonable assumptions on the density of the IGM and the relative velocity of NGC~300. The asymmetries in the gas disc suggest a proper motion of NGC~300 toward the south-east. At the same time, our data exclude IGM densities of significantly higher than $10^{-5}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ in the vicinity of NGC~300, as otherwise the outer gas disc would have been stripped."

In the second case, catastrophes may occur and kill a random fraction of the population and the process enjoys a quenched branching property. We emphasize on the study of the Laplace transform, which allows us to classify the long time behavior of these processes. In the second chapter, we model structured populations by measure-valued stochastic differential equations. Our approach is based on the individual dynamics. The individuals are characterized by parameters which have an influence on their survival or reproduction ability. Some of these parameters can be genetic and are inheritable except when mutations occur, but they can also be a space location or a quantity of parasites. The individuals compete for resources or other environmental constraints. We describe the population by a point measure-valued Markov process. We study macroscopic approximations of this process depending on the interplay between different scalings and obtain in the limit either integro-differential equations or reaction-diffusion equations or nonlinear super-processes. In each case, we insist on the specific techniques for the proof of convergence and for the study of the limiting model. The limiting processes offer different models of mutation-selection dynamics. Then, we study two-level models motivated by cell division dynamics, where the cell population is discrete and characterized by a trait, which may be continuous. In 1 particular, we finely study a process for parasite infection and the trait is the parasite load. The latter grows following a Feller diffusion and is randomly shared in the two daughter cells when the cell divides. Finally, we focus on the neutral case when the rate of division of cells is constant but the trait evolves following a general Markov process and may split in a random number of cells. The long time behavior of the structured population is then linked and derived from the behavior a well chosen SDE (monotype population)."

With an opposite variation of the N2 flow during the deposition, the nitrogen excess parameter (Nex) estimated by RBS measurements was introduced to investigate the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum behavior and emission properties. Different vibration modes of the Si--N and Si--O bonds have been carefully identified from the FTIR spectra characterizing such host matrices, especially the 'out-of-phase' stretching vibration mode of the Si--O bond. The highest Tb3+ photoluminescence (PL) intensity was obtained by optimizing the N incorporation and the annealing conditions. In addition, according to these conditions, the integrated PL intensity variation confirmed that the silicon nitride-based host matrix had a higher thermal threshold of rare earth clusterization than its silicon oxide counterpart. Analysis of time-resolved PL intensity versus T A showed the impact of Tb clustering on decay times, in agreement with the TEM observations. Finally, PL and PL excitation (PLE) experiments and comparison of the related spectra between undoped and Tb-doped samples were carried out to investigate the impact of the band tails on the excitation mechanism of Tb3+ ions."

I also want to point out that cutting down on the amount of paper towels used will reduce the amount of plastic trash bags used in bathrooms as well, because without the trash constantly filling up, there is less of a need to empty it regularly.  My observation was simply that I never see people in the US carrying or using handkerchiefs, and it seems to be a staple EDC item in India.

Then we used symplectic N-body integration to investigate the dynamics of the dust belt, as perturbed by a single planet. Different attempts were made assuming different masses for Fom b. We also performed a semi-analytical study to explain our results. Our results are in good agreement with others regarding the orbit of Fom b. We find that the orbit is highly eccentric, is close to apsidally aligned with the belt, and has a moderate mutual inclination relative to the belt plane of. If coplanar, this orbit crosses the disk. Our dynamical study then reveals that the observed planet could sculpt a transient belt configuration with a similar eccentricity to what is observed, but it would not be simultaneously apsidally aligned with the planet. This transient configuration only occurs a short time after the planet is placed on such an orbit (assuming an initially circular disk), a time that is inversely proportional to the planet's mass, and that is in any case much less than the 440 Myr age of the star. We constrain how long the observed dust belt could have survived with Fom b on its current orbit, as a function of its possible mass. This analysis leads us to conclude that Fom b is likely to have low mass, that it is unlikely to be responsible for the sculpting of the belt, and that it supports the hypothesis of a more massive, less eccentric planet companion Fom c."

These conclusions were received as a result of the fact that the relativistic factor enters to the expressions of the DF of photons and other physical expressions in the first order in the form $[ 1-(u^2/c^2) ] ^{-1}$, instead the $[ 1-(u^2/c^2) ] ^{-1/2}$ in Einstein theory. It is shown that the relativistic effect of deceleration of time really taking place for the relaxation time of carriers or for the life time of carriers, or for the period of electromagnetic oscillations.

From these measurements, we will provide at operational temperature the measurement of references frames set on the telescope simulator and NISP, the knowledge of the coordinates of the object point source provided by the telescope simulator and the measurement of the angle between the telescope simulator optical axis and NISP optical axis. In this context, we have developed a metrology method based on the use of a laser tracker to measure the position of the reflectors inside ERIOS. The laser tracker is installed outside the vacuum chamber and measure through a curved window reflectors put inside the chamber either at ambient pressure or vacuum pressure. Several tests campaigns have been done at LAM to demonstrate the measurement performance with this configuration. Using a well know reflectors configuration, we show that it is possible to correct the laser tracker measurement from the window disturbances and from the vacuum impact. A corrective term is applied to the data and allows retrieving the real coordinates of the reflectors with a bias lower than 30$\\mu$m, which is lower than the laser tracker measurement uncertainties estimated at 60$\\mu$m. No additional error term of the laser tracker measurement is observed when using the laser tracker with the curved window and in vacuum, comparing with a classical use of the laser tracker. With these test campaign, we have been able to demonstrate the possibility to use a laser tracker to measure in real time during a vacuum thermal test the position of different mechanical parts into a vacuum chamber with an accuracy better than 60$\\mu$m."

The sea coast effect has been taken into account in the 3-D inversion through generation of a 3-D resistivity model including the bathymetry around Martinique from the coast up to a distance of 200 km. The forward response of the model is used to calculate coast effect coefficients that are applied to the calculated MT response during the 3-D inversion process for comparison with the observed data. 3-D resistivity models of each sector, which are inherited from different geological history, show 3-D resistivity distribution and specificities related to its volcanological history. In particular, the geothermal field related to the Montagne Pel{\\'e}e strato-volcano, is characterized by a quasi ubiquitous conductive layer and quite monotonic typical resistivity distribution making interpretation difficult in terms of geothermal targets. At the opposite, the resistivity distribution of Anse d'Arlet area is radically different and geothermal target is thought to be connected to a not so deep resistive intrusion elongated along a main structural axis. Beside these interesting deep structures, we demonstrate, after analyzing the results of the recent heliborne TEM survey covering the whole Martinique, that surface resistivity distribution obtained from 3-D inversion reproduce faithfully the resistivity distribution observed by TEM. In spite of a very different sampling scale, this comparison illustrates the ability of 3-D MT inversion to take into account and reproduce static shift effects in the sub-surface resistivity distribution."

North signed a contract with Thomson's on 21 May 1862 for an armoured frigate of some 3,000 tons and 80 metres in length, for a contract price of 190,000 pounds sterling\u2014around two million Confederate dollars at the prevailing rate of exchange\u2014paying a deposit of 18,000 pounds. Thomson's contracted to the deliver the ship by 1 June 1863.\nKnown to the Confederates as \"North's ship\", or as \"Number 61\", she was Santa Maria to her builders. As finally completed, she displaced 4,750 tons, a slab-sided three-masted barque. Under steam, she would make 8 knots (15 km/h; 9.2 mph).\nBy the summer of 1863, the Confederate agents in Europe were seeking to sell off North's ship,  offering her to the Imperial Russian Navy. The ship was clearly unsuited to Confederate needs, being too large and requiring too large a crew for their limited resources, and her draft of 6 metres was too deep for operations in the shoal waters on the Confederate coasts. Thompson's too were concerned that they would not be allowed to deliver the ship to the Confederates in the changed political climate and cancelled the contract in late 1863.\nWork continued slowly on the ship, which was launched on 23 February 1864. The outbreak of the Second War of Schleswig led the Royal Danish Navy to purchase the ship, but delays in fitting out and working up meant that she was not ready for service before the end of the war.\nThe Danmark undertook only one active commission, from June to October 1869. At sea with her armament aboard she rolled violently, and the coal consumption of her engines was extremely high. As a result, she remained in reserve thereafter, becoming a barracks ship in 1893 before being eventually scrapped in 1907.\nAs commissioned into Danish service, she was armed with 20 60-pounder (8-inch) smoothbore muzzle-loading guns of 88 hundredweight and 8 18-pounder rifled muzzle-loading guns of 40 hundredweight. In 1865 this was changed to an all-rifled muzzle-loading armament of 12 60-pounder guns and 10 24-pounder guns. Two more 24-pounder guns were added in 1867."

In texts with diacritical marks, the pronunciation of an aleph as a consonant is rarely indicated by a special marking, hamza in Arabic and mappiq in Tiberian Hebrew.

Our inquiry is whether we can design a system for user-defined operators involving a new custom name binding. This paper proposes a module system for user-defined operators named a dsl class. A dsl class is similar to a normal class in Java but it contains operators instead of methods. We use operators for implementing custom name binding. For example, we use a nullary operator for emulating a variable name. An instance of a dsl class, called a dsl object, reifies an environment that expresses name binding. Programmers can control a scope of instance operators by specifying where the dsl object is active. We extend the host type system so that it can express the activation of a dsl object. In our system, a bound name is propagated through a type parameter to a dsl object. This enables us to implement user-defined language constructs involving static name binding. A contribution of this paper is that we reveal we can integrate a system for managing names and their scopes with a module and type system of an object-oriented language like Java. This allows us to implement a proposed system by adopting eager disambiguation based on expected types so that the compilation time will be acceptable. Eager disambiguation, which prunes out semantically invalid abstract parsing trees (ASTs) while a parser is running, is needed because the parser may generate a huge number of potentially valid ASTs for the same source code. We have implemented ProteaJ2, which is a programming language based on Java and it supports our proposal. We describe a parsing method that adopts eager disambiguation for fast parsing and discuss its time complexity. To show the practicality of our proposal, we have conducted two micro benchmarks to see the performance of our compiler. We also show several use cases of dsl classes for demonstrating dsl classes can express various language constructs. Our ultimate goal is to let programmers add any kind of new language construct to a host language. To do this, programmers should be able to define new syntax, name binding, and type system within the host language. This paper shows programmers can define the former two: their own syntax and name binding."

In particular, we show that in stably stratified spheres, the Rayleigh numbers $Ra$ at the onset evolve like $Ra \\sim Ek^{-1}$, where $Ek$ is the Ekman number. This differs from rotating convection in unstably stratified spheres, for which $Ra \\sim Ek^{-4/3}$. The domain of existence of inviscid convection thus increases as $Ek^{-1/3}$. Second, we perform nonlinear simulations. We find a transition between two regimes of RDDC, controlled by the strength of the stratification. Furthermore, far from the RDDC onset, we find a dominating equatorially anti-symmetric, large-scale zonal flow slightly above the associated linear onset. Unexpectedly, a purely linear mechanism can explain this phenomenon, even far from the instability onset, yielding a symmetry breaking of the nonlinear flow at saturation. For even stronger stable stratification, the flow becomes mainly equatorially-symmetric and intense zonal jets develop. Finally, we apply our results to the early Earth core. Double diffusion can reduce the critical Rayleigh number by four decades for realistic core conditions. We suggest that the early Earth core was prone to turbulent RDDC, with large-scale zonal flows."

        "text": " to the end-to-end verification of compilers, we implemented a generator of verified lexers whose usage is similar to OCamllex. Our software, called Coqlex, reads a lexer specification and generates a lexer equipped with a Coq proof of its correctness. It provides a formally verified implementation of most features of standard, unverified lexer generators. The conclusions of our work are two-fold: Firstly, verified lexers gain to follow a user experience similar to lex/flex or OCamllex, with a domain-specific syntax to write lexers comfortably. This introduces a small gap between the written artifact and the verified lexer, but our design minimizes this gap and makes it practical to review the generated lexer. The user remains able to prove further properties of their lexer. Secondly, it is possible to combine simplicity and decent performance. Our implementation approach that uses Brzozowski derivatives is noticeably simpler than the previous work in Verbatim++ that tries to generate a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) ahead of time, and it is also noticeably faster thanks to careful design choices. We wrote several example lexers that suggest that the convenience of using Coqlex is close to that of standard verified generators, in particular, OCamllex. We used Coqlex in an industrial project to implement a verified lexer of Ada. This lexer is part of a tool to optimize safety-critical programs, some of which are very large. This experience confirmed that Coqlex is usable in practice, and in particular that its performance is good enough. Finally, we performed detailed performance comparisons between Coqlex, OCamllex, and Verbatim++. Verbatim++ is the state-of-the-art tool for verified lexers in Coq, and the performance of its lexer was carefully optimized in previous work by Egolf and al. (2022). Our results suggest that Coqlex is two orders of magnitude slower than OCamllex, but two orders of magnitude faster than Verbatim++. Verified compilers and other language-processing tools are becoming important tools for safety-critical or security-critical applications. They provide trust and replace more costly approaches to certification, such as manually reading the generated code. Verified lexers are a missing piece in several Coq-based verified compilers today. Coqlex comes with safety guarantees, and thus shows that it is possible to build formally verified front-ends."

If the heating power is increased, the temperature of the heating surface increases with the heat flux. When the heat flux from the heater reaches a threshold value q CHF (the critical heat flux, CHF), the vapor bubbles suddenly form a film which covers the heating surface and insulates the latter from the bulk of the liquid. The temperature of the heating surface grows so rapidly that the heater can fuse unless its power is controlled. This phenomenon is known under the names of \"boiling crisis,\" \"burnout,\" or \"Departure from Nucleate Boiling\" (DNB) [1]. The final state of this transition is called film boiling. This problem has become very important since the 1940's, with the beginning of the industrial exploitation of heat exchangers with large heat fluxes (as with nuclear power stations). Since then a huge amount of research has been done for the various conditions of pool boiling (boiling without imposed external flow) and flow boiling (boiling of the flowing water) [2]. Numerous empirical correlations have been proposed, each describing the dependence of the CHF on the physical parameters of the liquid and of the heater more or less correctly for a particular geometry and particular conditions of boiling [2]. A strong dependence of the threshold on the details of the experimental setup coupled with difficulties in separating the consequences of DNB from its causes is at the origin of a large number of frequently controversial hypotheses [2]. The violence of boiling makes observations quite difficult. Good quality photographic experiments are presented in only a few articles (see e.g. [3] -- [6]). Despite an increasing interest in the physical aspect of the problem during recent years [7,8] and numerous empirical approaches, the underlying physics still remains obscure. In this Letter, we propose a model based on a non-equilibrium drying transition."

Physical factors refer to the location of the epicentre of the earthquake, spatial distribution/layout and attributes of environmental objects such as buildings, roads, barriers (cars), placement of safe areas, evacuation routes, and the resulting debris/damage from the earthquake. Experiments tested the influence of time of the day, presence of disabled persons and earthquake intensity. Initial results show that factors that influence arrivals in safe areas include (a) human factors (age, disability, speed), (b) pre-evacuation behaviours, (c) perception distance (social attachment, time of day), (d) social interaction during evacuation, and (e) physical and spatial aspects, such as limitations imposed by debris (damage), and the distance to safe areas. To validate the results, scenarios will be designed with stakeholders, who will also take part in the definition of a serious game. The recommendation of this research is that both social and physical aspects should be considered when defining vulnerability in the analysis of risk."

But if you dont mind touching raw ingredients, then the garlic thing gives you absolutely no benefits.\nFlRELYNX: You shouldn\u2019t use the hand method if you need to use the egg whites for baking, like in merengue, as you can\u2019t have any fat contents in your bowl when mixing them. Your hands contain natural oils acting just like fat. Also I don\u2019t get how it would take any longer than sifting it by hand. It takes me about 5 seconds to use the shell method and I don\u2019t waste as much egg whites. A lot of the egg white liquid will stick to my hands but it doesn\u2019t stick to the insides of the shells, as they\u2018re coated in that wet membrane.\nharriettbakes: Sorry, that is not correct. I am a baker and use the hand method as much as possible. I can get much more of the egg white separated from the yolk using my hands vs. any other method, and the resultant egg whites never fail to whip up fluffy and light. \n\nThe egg shell method is more likely to stab the yolk as you are separating. Yolk in the egg whites is what limits successful whipping. Maybe your hands weren\u2019t entirely clean from a different step and there were oils left over on your hand.\nFlRELYNX: I never touch any raw ingredients when whipping up whites and I always clean my bowls with vinegar, if I need to. I also always wash my hands with soap after each step. I\u2019ve learned this trick from a SORTEDfood video and in my experience, it has proven to be true. The yolk shouldn\u2019t be stabbed by the shells if you do it correctly (do not shove one shell into the other but rather hold them slightly under each other). It\u2018s important that you break them correctly though, so that the shells don\u2019t crack too much. That\u2019s a matter of practice - of course this will be the same with all methods. I have never had any shells in my dough/ merengue etc. but I\u2018ve had problems with them not whipping correctly, which I didn\u2019t have after switching to this method. So maybe you were just lucky with your merengue or because of your experience in handling the whipping. My mother doesn\u2019t clean her bowls as thoroughly as I do (she doesn\u2019t really like baking because of the effort) and she doesn\u2019t really bother separating them correctly (i.e. once she accidentally had a tiny bit of yolk in there) but she still always manages to whip her whites up beautifully. So I guess it also depends on the quality of your eggs and on your whipping method. Nevertheless, the science says any oils in your whites will make it harder to whip them! And I\u2018m not really good at whipping, so I definitely prefer my method, just to be safe.\nharriettbakes: Wow, more power to you! To each his own.

The 63k is inflated because the Volkswagen plant is also the head office of Volkswagen, which employs much more people.\ngehremba: Even worse. If you have 13k employees that make cars but need 63k there total then you're pretty inefficient if the 12k at Tesla are total employees f\u00fcr that site\nJayer244: Like I said, it's the head office. It manages not only this plant but every other plant worldwide, marketing, global finances, the stock holders, sponsorships, the cooperation with other members of the Volkswagen Gruppe like Porsche and Audi and recently decided that the later two are allowed to try building motors for F1.\n\nYou have no idea what you're talking about apparently.\ngehremba: Alright, so you have about 10k employees in the Tesla headquarters. Let's go with this train of thought and add that in, so 22k per 500k cars annually, so 22 cars per FTE. And on the other side of the ring we have 63k for 1 mil cars, with 16 cars per FTE. If you factor that in it is much closer, I will give you that. But considering the fact how young Tesla is and how old, and strong VW is, it is really crazy how fast they are evolving. They will overtake established brands soon enough. \n\nAnd adding to that, going back to your original point, how exactly is bigger better here?\nJayer244: &gt;And on the other side of the ring we have 63k for 1 mil cars, with 16 cars per FTE.\n\nAgain, no. The Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg doesn't just build cars. The plant itself is the head quarters of the Volkswagen Gruppe which includes VW, Audi, Porsche, Skoda, Lamborghini, Bentlay, Ducati, Cupra and Seat. You're sticking to the 63k number I've said earlier even though that is already outdated just because it fits your argument. Don't think no one here sees what you're doing here.\n\nAnd with that I'll end this pointless debate with the Elon fanboy. Gute Nacht.\n"

I'd guess you should start over with the floor. The siding probably should come off to get sheathing underneath it. I would think this would be in the range of several thousands, probably more than you, as a renter, would want to do, and you'd certainly need to get the owners permission.\n\nThat being said, you could give it a good cleaning. Pull the ivy back away from the structure and keep it trimmed back (if the owner is OK with that). That will help you find a lot of holes that critters can get into. You can patch those in a variety of ways (steel wool, boards, expanding foam etc.). I wouldn't insulate the walls until/unless you seal it from mice (it will give them a permanent place to live). If you wanted to spring for some floor paint, that might help keep dust down (after a very good cleaning). I wouldn't build a false floor over it (permanent critter home). Since you said there are no obvious leaks, you can use it for storage. I'd suggest racks to keep stuff off the floor. Turning it into a hang out spot will be a big undertaking.\nprozhack: that makes sense, I think we're going to do something like this, just seal the holes pull back the ivy and maybe use gravel to level the floor out. \n\nThanks everyone!\n"

Really just to show people up.\nrockzn: Seems to me like you should work on your mental health.

Physical capability gets you further than anything else. If you score high on the PT test they offer you airborne, ranger, or green beret contracts straight out of boot camp in the army, in addition to eventual sniper school, sapper training, and high speed units like 10th mountain, 101st airborne, or ranger bats.They don't put milk duds as shock troops or SF.

It\u2019s a whole different ball if he's simply focussing on bettering himself.

Data measured at PDM and CRA were combined to form a5-year hourly dataset of 23 meteorological variables notably: temperature, humidity, cloud cover, wind at several altitudes. The dataset was classified using hierarchical clustering, with the aim of grouping together the days which had similar meteorological characteristics. To complete the clustering, we computed several diagnostic tools, in order to provide additional information and study specific phenomena (foehn, precipitation, atmospheric vertical structure, and thermally driven circulations). This classification resulted in six clusters: three highly populated clusters which correspond to the most frequent meteorological conditions (fair weather, mixed weather and disturbed weather, respectively); a small cluster evidencing clear characteristics of winter northwesterly windstorms; and two small clusters characteristic of south foehn (south- to southwesterly large-scaleflow, associated with warm and dry downslope flow on the lee side of the chain). The diagnostic tools applied to the six clusters provided results in line with the conclusions tentatively drawn from 23 meteorological variables. This, to some extent,validates the approach of hierarchical clustering of local data to distinguish weather regimes. Then statistics of atmospheric composition at PDM were analysed and discussed for each cluster. Radon measurements, notably, revealed that the regional background in the lower troposphere dominates the influence of diurnal thermal flows when daily averaged concentrations are considered. Differences between clusters were demonstrated by the anomalies of CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, O$_3$ and aerosol number concentration, and interpretations in relation with chemical sinks and sources are proposed."

We address this concern of combining protocols via a novel notion of 'interleaving' composition for protocols described via a process algebra. User-specified, domain-specific constraints can be inserted into the individual protocols to serve as 'contact points' to guide this composition procedure, which outputs a single combined protocol that can be programmed against. Our approach allows an engineer to then program against a number of protocols that have been composed (re-integrated), reflecting the true nature of applications that must handle multiple protocols at once. We prove various desirable properties of the composition, including behaviour preservation: that the composed protocol implements the behaviour of both component protocols. We demonstrate our approach in the practical setting of Erlang, with a tool implementing protocol composition that both generates Erlang code from a protocol and generates a protocol from Erlang code. This tool shows that, for a range of sample protocols (including real-world examples), a modest set of constraints can be inserted to produce a small number of candidate compositions to choose from. As we increasingly build software interacting with many programs and subsystems, this new perspective gives a foundation for improving software quality via protocol conformance in a multi-protocol setting."

We also derive a metric from Hong et al., 2006, Effective Exon Number (EEN), to compare the distribution of exon sizes within transcripts against random expectations of uniform exon placement. EEN accounts for differences in exon size, which is important because novel genes differences in complexity for orthologs and whole transcriptome analyses are biased towards low complexity genes with few exons and few alternative transcripts. With our metric analyses, we are able to implement changes in complexity across diverse lineages with greater precision and accuracy than previous cross-species comparisons under ortholog conditioning. These analyses represent a step forward toward whole transcriptome analysis in the emerging field of non-model evolutionary genomics, with key insights for evolutionary inference of complexity changes on deep timescales across the tree of life. We suggest a means to quantify biases generated in ortholog calling and correct complexity analysis for lineage-specific effects.

Part two is an impact study demonstrating the added value of the QC approach to explore clinical results derived from two patient populations with significant fatigue: COVID19 and multiple sclerosis (MS). Experimental: 31P-MRS was performed on a 3T clinical MRI in 175 subjects from clinical and healthy control populations conducted in a University Hospital. An advanced data QC Score (QCS) was developed using multiple objective criteria. The criteria were based on current recommendations from the literature enriched by new proposals based on clinical experience. The QCS was designed to indicate valid and corrupt data and guide necessary objective data editing to extract as much valid physiological data as possible. Dynamic acquisitions using an MR-compatible ergometer ran over a rest(40s), exercise(2min), and a recovery phase(6min). Results: Using QCS enabled rapid identification of subjects with data anomalies allowing the user to correct the data series or reject them partially or entirely as well as identify fully valid datasets. Overall, the use of the QCS resulted in the automatic classification of 45% of the subjects including 58 participants that had data with no criterion violation and 21 participants with violations that resulted in the rejection of all dynamic data. The remaining datasets were inspected manually with guidance allowing acceptance of full datasets from an additional 80 participants and recovery phase data from an additional 16 subjects. Overall, more anomalies occurred with patient data (35% of datasets) compared to healthy controls (15% of datasets). Conclusion: This paper describes typical difficulties encountered during the dynamic acquisition of 31P-MRS. Based on these observations, a standardized data quality control pipeline was created and implemented in both healthy and patient populations. The QC scoring ensures a standardized data rejection procedure and rigorous objective analysis of dynamic 31P-MRS data obtained from patients. The contribution of this methodology contributes to efforts made to standardize the practices of the 31P-MRS that has been underway for a decade, with the ultimate goal of making it an empowered tool for clinical research."

They inform us about the spectral elements of some coarse-grained version of the SDE generator. When the time-lag at which the transitions are collected from partial observations in V , is either sufficiently small or large, it is shown that the reduced RP resonances approximate the (weak) RP resonances of the generator of the conditional expectation in V , i.e. the optimal reduced system in V obtained by averaging out the contribution of the unobserved variables. The approach is illustrated on a stochastic slow-fast system for which it is shown that the reduced RP resonances allow for a good reconstruction of the correlation functions and PSDs, even when the time-scale separation is weak.The companions articles, Part II and Part III, deal with further practical aspects of the theory presented in this contribution. One important byproduct consists of the diagnosis usefulness of stochastic dynamics that RP resonances provide. This is illustrated in the case of a stochastic Hopf bifurcation in Part II. There, it is shown that such a bifurcation has a clear manifestation in terms of a geometric organization of the RP resonances along discrete parabolas in the left half plane. Such geometric features formed by (reduced) RP resonances are extractable from time series and allow thus for providing an unambiguous \"signature\" of nonlinear oscillations embedded within a stochastic background. By relying then on the theory of reduced RP resonances presented in this contribution, Part III addresses the question of detection and characterization of such oscillations in a high-dimensional stochastic system, namely the Cane-Zebiak model of El Ni{\\~n}o-Southern Oscillation subject to noise modeling fast atmospheric fluctuations."

In a sense they demand a very personal relationship with God and demonize not actively praying, yet they ignore that even \"good\" Christians commit crimes, and they all have eyes on the wrong things. There is a great focus on finding demons and making themselves look good by fighting them, which has been splitting this country upon many bases.\n\nThe things that need to be focused on are the principles themselves rather than the act of praying. The ideals of not doing harm unto others, being charitable of one's self, and of not judging others based on preconceived notions are all highly useful and need more face value given to them than the act of getting on one's knees. Most of us are told to never kneel, so to have that be so central to something 77% of the U.S. submits to is very strange.\n"

They say they like a certain musician, listen to that musician before the next time you see them so you can comment on that.  The easiest way to fake an interest in a person is not to fake it, genuinely look into what they are interested in.  \n\nIt doesn't even have to be something you like.  My friend is a football fan, and I fucking hate sports.  But I know the team she likes and the team she hates, and I put stuff from the team she hates on her desk at work.  Even if you do something annoying to tease a friend, at least do it in a way that shows you listen to what they say and see them.\nPhysical_Key_4041: so with the musician example say I listen to a band they recommend, how would I then comment about that band in the follow up conversation\n\nlike for example I like avatar the last air bender (show) yet even if I meet someone else who likes the show I wouldn\u2019t know how to talk about it with them, like do I just say \u201cI liked the band you recommended\u201d surely not that ain\u2019t really a convo, so like say I listen to the band they recommend, how would I then discuss that band with them \n\nor take avatar the last airbender how would I discuss the show with someone that\u2019s already seen it\nthe_entroponaut: That's an interesting question, because I guess if I said \"It will just flow from there\" then that wouldn't be helpful at all!  \n\nIt is tricky to answer though, because conversations are so dynamic that it is hard to apply programmatic rules to them.  I mean, I loved The Last Airbender, but it is hard to come up with cold topics about it.  Personally I might bring up themes of apotheosis in shows (though some people might think I'm pretentious for that, but I am pretentious so I guess that's just me).  Or how I really love that the series format can grant a long time for several character development arcs that a movie can't, evolving into a metal bender or a blood bender and such.  Basically you are going to go into some (but not exhaustive) detail about why you liked it, and your favorite parts, and find out theirs.\n\nAnd that guidelines applies to most topics.  Music talk tends to be a bit more shallow (unless you are a musician) than movie/TV talk.  It's usually along a format of \"I liked this band, it reminded me of this band, have you heard of them?\"  A finding common ground kind of thing.\n"

Me and George Bush on opposite sides\".\nThe event was originally scheduled for 28\u201330 September 2001 but was postponed for a year on 16 September following the September 11 attacks. \"The PGA of America has informed the European Ryder Cup Board that the scope of the last Tuesday's tragedy is so overwhelming that it would not be possible for the United States Ryder Cup team and officials to attend the match this month.\" The manager of Phil Mickelson and Mark Calcavecchia had earlier announced that the two players would not travel to Europe. Other American players were said to be concerned about attending the event. It was agreed that the same captains and players would participate in the 2002 event.\nIt was later decided to thereafter play matches in even-numbered years instead of odd-numbered, shifting the already-scheduled 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013 editions to 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014, respectively.  This in turn caused a corresponding change in schedules for the Presidents Cup, Solheim Cup, and Seve Trophy (all of which are played in years the Ryder Cup is not played). The Presidents Cup was in turn delayed by a year, while both the Solheim Cup and Seve Trophy played their 2002 matches as scheduled then subsequently started playing in odd-numbered years in 2003. The Junior Ryder Cup, which was also scheduled for 2001, was rescheduled for 2002. In a case of anachronism, the display boards at The Belfry still read \"The 2001 Ryder Cup\", and U.S. captain Curtis Strange deliberately referred to his team as \"The 2001 Ryder Cup Team\" in his speech at the closing ceremony. 18 years later, these changes would be reverted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which postponed the 2020 Ryder Cup to 2021.\nThis was the second of seven consecutive victories at home by Europe, a streak that remains intact through 2023."

We determined that the spectroscopic sample is strongly biased in favour of metal-poor stars, as intended. A comparison with the unbiased photometric sample allows to correct for the selection bias. We select a sub-sample of stars with reliable parallaxes for which we combine the SDSS radial velocities with Gaia proper motions and parallaxes to compute actions and orbital parameters in the Galactic potential. This allows us to characterize the stars dynamically, and in particular to select a sub-sample that belongs to the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) accretion event. We are thus able to provide also the MDF of GSE. Conclusions. The metal-weak tail derived in our study is very similar to that derived in the H3 survey and in the Hamburg/ESO Survey. This allows us to average the three MDFs and provide an error bar for each metallicity bin. Inasmuch the GSE structure is representative of the progenitor galaxy that collided with the Milky Way, that galaxy appears to be strongly deficient in metal-poor stars compared to the Milky Way, suggesting that the metal-weak tail of the latter has been largely formed by accretion of low mass galaxies rather than massive galaxies, such as the GSE progenitor."

Means I've gone backwards in a year. I know CC is meant to be helping with base strength and all at first but... does this make sense? I think if I wasn't doing grip training deadhangs I wouldn't even be able to hang off a bar. \n\nWould appreciate advice. Either put my head down and continue building reps with CC step  (I'm currently up to about 19 on the first set, 12 on the second. At my current rate I'd estimate I'll take another 4-5 months to reach progression standard) or move to a better more useful progression - if so what?\nhybridchildren: Hey, don't be disheartened, man! I've spent over 1 year stuck on some exercise then suddenly progress super fast once I discovered the weakness in my training. I'm confident you can do it too.\n\nSo let me get this straight; you could do 3-4 full pull ups before doing CC? If so, why not start at level 5 instead of level 2? I'm guessing I'm misunderstanding you.\n\nAnyway, like m092 says, my suggestion is to practice negatives to build up strength to reach full pull ups. I don't know how dedicated you are to CC, but I also suggest you abandon it (AT LEAST for pull ups; you can work on the other big 6 if you like) in favor of a different progression method. Depending on your goals, I think you can achieve full PU and OAPU following a simpler path. \n\nSo here's what I'd do if I were you. \n\n#1 do (or build up to) 3x5 sets of FULL, slow negatives for your PU training. No more jack knife pulls. \n\n#2 I don't know the rest of your workout, but if this is an important goal, put the negatives in the beginning of the workout. \n\n#3 Once you are more confident with your negatives, give PUs a shot again. If you can do 1 set of 3 reps, I'd say thats enough to move on from negatives and start training PUs themselves. Work up to 3x5 again.\n\n#4 If you have spare weight in the form of fat, focus on losing some of it through healthier/reduced eating. This will not only help your PUs but all other BW exercises. DO NOT amputate a leg or two for quick gainz.\n\n#5 report back in 2 weeks with progress, no matter how small or big. \n\ncomputersaidno: I'll try this. \nmyp123: Errr, still waiting on that report.\n"

In this study, a novel mixed FUS/MEA platform was designed for the spatio-temporal description of the causal responses generated by single 1.78 MHz FUS pulses in ex vivo mouse hippocampal brain slices. Main results: Our results show that FUS pulses can generate local field potentials (LFPs), sustained by synchronized neuronal post-synaptic potentials, and reproducing network activities. LFPs induced by FUS stimulation were found to be repeatable to consecutive FUS pulses though exhibiting a wide range of amplitudes (50-600 $\\mu$V), durations (20-200 ms), and response delays (10-60 ms). Moreover, LFPs were spread across the hippocampal slice following single FUS pulses thus demonstrating that FUS may be capable of stimulating different neural structures within the hippocampus. Significance: Current knowledge on neurostimulation by ultrasound describes neuronal activity generated by trains of repetitive ultrasound pulses. This novel study details the causal neural responses produced by single-pulse FUS neurostimulation while illustrating the distribution and propagation properties of this neural activity along major neural pathways of the hippocampus."

We establish a Quantum Ergodicity (QE) theorem for the eigenfunctions of any associated sR Laplacian under the assumption that the Reeb flow is ergodic. The limit measure is given by the normalized Popp measure.This is the first time that such a result is established for a hypoelliptic operator, whereas the usual Shnirelman theorem yields QE for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a closed Riemannian manifold with ergodic geodesic flow.To prove our theorem, we first establish a microlocal Weyl law, which allows us to identify the limit measure and to prove the microlocal concentration of the eigenfunctions on the characteristic manifold of the sR Laplacian. Then, we derive a Birkhoff normal form along this characteristic manifold, thus showing that, in some sense, all 3D contact structures are microlocally equivalent. The quantum version of this normal form provides a useful microlocal factorization of the sR Laplacian. Using the normal form, the factorization and the ergodicity assumption, we finally establish a variance estimate, from which QE follows.We also obtain a second result, which is valid without any ergodicity assumption: every Quantum Limit (QL) can be decomposed in a sum of two mutually singular measures: the first measure is supported on the unit cotangent bundle and is invariant under the sR geodesic flow, and the second measure is supported on the characteristic manifold of the sR Laplacian and is invariant under the lift of the Reeb flow. Moreover, we prove that the first measure is zero for most QLs."

If you are serious about training and eat accordingly you will notice measurable results (ie you can do 1-2 more pushups or whatever) in maybe 2 weeks. And if you say start eating properly and exercise then your muscle may store more water and whatnot. So you may have a quick antithetical result as well.\nHowever if you have more bodyfat initially, then your visual results may come a bit later.\nlegatostaccato: yeah that's fair. i'm fairly lean now, though dreading going back to a skinny-fat \"look\", hehe. hopefully bulk will go well in a week or two when i start. got a clean diet at least.\n"

Interstitial porosity corresponds to onboard total porosity corrected from clay bound water and is more relevant in terms of sediment compaction state and fluid flow properties. Interstitial porosity versus vertical effective stress curve shows no evidence of undercompaction and suggests that the input section 2 has been experiencing normal consolidation due to high sediment accumulation rate. The porosity anomaly observed in the prefan pelagic unit results from the local occurrence of water-bearing minerals like smectite rather than excess pore pressure, which might, however, buildup more landward in the basin.

        "text": " did the galaxy evolve and transform themselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to present-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout the Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between these, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract some digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is classification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From images obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his observations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter (the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four categories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the famous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these classes, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been refined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global classification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by Hubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used to represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the Hubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can be understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations found between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one must admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble classification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the most obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate, qualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to characterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant multivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since the year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble classification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble classification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet emerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate analyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling the observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar clusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant objects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our present day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem. Astrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in astrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum Parsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new exploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \\& Fraix-Burnet, 2013). As far as the classification of galaxies is concerned, a larger number of objects must now be analysed. In this paper, I"

Our method is uniquely capable to show that none of the TI's found exhibit fragile topology. We partition the topological materials in different physical classes. For the majority of the 5797 \"high-quality'' topological material, we compute: the topological class (equivalence classes of TQC elementary band representations -- equivalent to the topological index), the symmetry(ies) that protects the topological class, the representations at high symmetry points and the direct gap (for insulators), and the topological index. For topological semimetals we then compute whether the system becomes a topological insulator (whose index/class we compute) upon breaking symmetries -- useful for experiments. 2152 more TI's are obtained in this way. For almost all 5065 non-f-electron topological materials, we provide the electronic band structures, allowing the identification of quantitative properties (gaps, velocities). Remarkably, our exhaustive results show that a large proportion ( ~ 24% !) of all materials in nature are topological (confirmed by calculations of \"low-quality'' materials). We confirm the topology of several new materials by Wilson loop calculations. We added an open-source code and end-user button on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server (BCS) which checks the topology of any material.

For example, in the context of pool testing, the edge set $E$ may consist of families, work teams, or students in a classroom, i.e., subsets likely to be mutually contaminated. The goal in studying the generalized setting is to leverage the additional knowledge characterized by $H=(V,E)$ to significantly reduce the number of required tests. The paper considers both adaptive and non-adaptive group testing and makes the following contributions. First, for the non-adaptive setting, we show that finding an optimal solution for the generalized version of group testing is NP-hard. For this setting, we present a solution that requires $O(d\\log{|E|})$ tests, where $d$ is the maximum size of a set $e \\in E$. Our solutions generalize those given for the traditional setting and are shown to be of order-optimal size $O(\\log{|E|})$ for hypergraphs with edges that have ``large'' symmetric differences. For the adaptive setting, when edges in $E$ are of size exactly $d$, we present a solution of size $O(\\log{|E|}+d\\log^2{d})$ that comes close to the lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log{|E|} + d)$."

Each profile has been manually edited using standard GPR data processing including migration, to pick the reflection arrival time from the ice-bedrock interface. Snow cover was evaluated through 42 snow drilling measurements regularly spaced to cover all the glacier. These data were acquired at the time of the GPR survey and subsequently spatially interpolated using ordinary kriging. Using a snow velocity of 0.22 m/ns, the snow thickness was converted to electromagnetic wave travel-times and subtracted from the picked travel-times to the ice-bedrock interface. The resulting travel-times were converted to ice thickness using a velocity of 0.17 m/ns. The velocity uncertainty is discussed from a common mid-point profile analysis. A total of 67542 georeferenced data points with GPR-derived ice thicknesses, in addition to a glacier boundary line derived from satellite images taken during summer, were interpolated over the entire glacier surface using kriging with a 10 m grid size. Some uncertainty analysis were carried on and we calculated an averaged ice thickness of 76 m and a maximum depth of 164 m with a relative error of 11.9%. The volume of the glacier is derived as 0.3487$\\pm$0.041 km3. Finally a 10-m grid map of the bedrock topography was derived by subtracting the ice thicknesses from a dual-frequency GPS-derived digital elevation model of the surface. These two datasets are the first step for modelling thermal evolution of the glacier and its bedrock, as well as the main hydrological network."

The theoretical results are applied to the telluric planets and moons of the solar system as well as to three Super-Earths: 55 CnC e, CoRoT-7b, and GJ 1214b.

It's kinda covered in grease by design (inside the head at peast) so might be hard to show anything pertinent.\nReptarKingOfCalzones: Just an overall picture to see where you are in the assembly process and what model you have.\nSecretConspirer: [Here](https://imgur.com/efF0hCh) is a photo of what I have going on. Added grease to the appropriate portions of assembly. This is obviously without the head reattached. With the top portion reassembled, I add the 5 screws underneath to connect the base to the head, then go to attach the planetary assembly. It's at that point that the friction between the shaft and the planetary assembly is so great that it shifts the planetary shaft upwards. Without the top on, of course, it would simply go all the way up (and you wouldn't be able to get the screws in anyway since they sit underneath the planetary assembly).\nReptarKingOfCalzones: Okay I have had issues like this in the past but not to this degree. Have you tried degreasing the bottom end of the planetary shaft and the hole in the planetary assembly with a solvent?\nSecretConspirer: It was cleaned with 70% isopropyl alcohol, then soap and water, prior to reassembly. This machine hadn't been serviced since it was manufactured in 2002. However, I will try giving the shaft another polishing (pun intended) and see if that reduces friction.\nReptarKingOfCalzones: This is the reason why I prefer the models where the top is removable with screws under the metal band. Much easier to service.\nSecretConspirer: So here's how I got it done. Cleaned the portion of the shaft sticking out below with iso again, and made sure to clean inside the pin hole. Cleaned the pin hole of the planetary attachment and also cleaned extra super well inside the hole where the shaft would go. Attached the planetary portion and it was juuuust enough to give a tiny view of the pinhole on the shaft. Shoved a paperclip through there and use pliers to force the shaft down enough while my partner held the planetary attachment in place, thereby aligning the holes ever so sightly more. It was just enough that I was able to get the pin punch into the pinhole of the shaft and leverage it further down, again as my partner held the attachment up. Bent the pin punch, too, but eventually I got it fully aligned. Then hammered the shit out of the pin because it didn't want to go back in either.\n\nBut it works. I cleaned it myself, reassembled, and it works! For a bit, at least, hopefully another year or two. There's still a whir when it runs, but I'm no electrician.\n"

Despite its apparent simplicity, the small noise limit of such a system already exhibits various behaviours. In particular, depending on the drift coefficient, the particles can either stick into a cluster, the velocity of which is determined by elementary computations, or drift away from each other at constant velocity, in a random ordering. The persistence of randomness in the zero noise limit is of the very same nature as in the pioneering works by Veretennikov (Mat. Zametki, 1983) and Bafico and Baldi (Stochastics, 1981) concerning the so-called Peano phenomenon. In the case of rank-based processes, we use a simple convexity argument to prove that the small noise limit is described by the sticky particle dynamics introduced by Brenier and Grenier (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 1998), where particles travel at constant velocity between collisions, at which they stick together. In the general case of order-based processes, we give a sufficient condition on the drift for all the particles to aggregate into a single cluster, and compute the velocity of this cluster. Our argument consists in turning the study of the small noise limit into the study of the long time behaviour of a suitably rescaled process, and then exhibiting a Lyapunov functional for this rescaled process."

When describing the grammar rules for such water, the developer must consider other rules and enumerate a set of symbols, which we call alternative symbols. Due to this difficulty, island parsing seems to be not widely used today despite its usefulness in many applications. Approach: This paper proposes the lake symbols for addressing this difficulty in developing an island parser. It also presents an extension to PEG for supporting the lake symbols. The lake symbols automate the enumeration of the alternative symbols for the water inside an island. The paper proposes an algorithm for translating the extended PEG to the normal PEG, which can be given to an existing parser generator based on PEG. Knowledge: The user can use lake symbols to define water without specifying each alternative symbol. Our algorithms can calculate all alternative symbols for a lake symbol, based on where the lake symbol is used in the grammar. Grounding: We implemented a parser generator accepting our extended PEG and implemented 36 island parsers for Java and 20 island parsers for Python. Our experiments show that the lake symbols reduce 42 % of grammar rules for Java and 89 % of rules for Python on average, excluding the case where islands are expressions. Importance: This work eases the use of island parsing. Lake symbols enable the user to define the water inside the island simpler than before. Defining water inside the island is essential to apply island parsing for practical programming languages."

I\u2019ve seen many very experienced fighters knocked out at competitions with these moves. The reason you don\u2019t see them more is they are blind maneuvers and require a much higher level of precision and control than a side kick.\nNeuro-Sysadmin: In terms of energy transferred, I\u2019d be curious to see the numbers on each kick. I would suspect a back-side kick would impact harder, but I admit I don\u2019t have the data on that.\n\nFor clarity\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll add that I was referring to a kick like the one shown, turning toward the back with the back leg, but moving the back leg linearly out into a side kick at the end of the turn instead of keeping the knee bent and sweeping the foot around. Not a basic side kick where your torso faces the front the entire time.\n\nAlso, the power of the kick used in the video could have been higher if it was a back-spinning kick instead of a spinning-back kick - with the kicking leg straight as it rotates around, instead of bent. Granted, that would have been much slower and harder to pull off. \n\nNot sure why any of those 3 kicks (or the spinning backfist) would need to be performed truly blind though. I was always taught that the goal was to acquire the target while turning, at least in an ideal state. Doesn\u2019t always work out, but there should usually be a decent chance to manage it.\n\nP.s. Not saying I haven\u2019t thrown plenty of kicks just like that one (knee bent, with rotation) especially in competition, when hitting the target beats theoretical form, because I definitely have. Nor am I saying it didn\u2019t get the job done, that was a great KO!\n\nJust clarifying my earlier statement with the thought that either the leg-fully-extended, rotating motion of a back-spinning kick (striking with the back/bottom of heel first) or the turn-and-linear-extension of a back-side kick (bottom of heel striking first) would have imparted greater power that that kick, (rotating, knee bent, striking with the bottom of the foot) from a physics perspective of the techniques.\n\nEdit: TKD terminology and experience basis, on my end. We don\u2019t use hand techniques to the head in competition, fwiw, and the terms for the kicks might be somewhat different, which is why I added the attempt at extra descriptions. The physics should be the same, though, and the three variations of spinning/turning kicks should all be performed very similarly between Taekwondo and Karate, afaik. YMMV.\npurenergy12: As far as power I suppose up for debate. But they are certainly both blind maneuvers and as such are not allowed in many competitions. That split second when you turn and snap your head around you lose sight of the opponent. Less experienced fighters can cause a lot more than a knockout in this situation so leaving it to the experts makes sense. To me as far as the power thing goes the spin makes sense. Think about throwing a discus. It\u2019s the spin that brings the power.\n"

We identify their boundary representations, we analyse their C*-envelopes, and we give criteria for hyperrigidity. Moreover we completely classify them in terms of the data provided by the monomial ideals. For tensor algebras of C*-correspondences and bounded isomorphisms this is achieved up to the level of local conjugacy (in the sense of Davidson and Roydor) for the quantised dynamics. For tensor algebras of subproduct systems and algebraic isomorphisms this is achieved up to the level of equality of monomial ideals modulo permutations of the variables. In the process we accomplish more in different directions. Most notably we show that tensor algebras form a complete invariant for isomorphic (resp. similar) subproduct systems of homogeneous ideals up to isometric (resp. bounded) isomorphisms. The results on local conjugacy are obtained via an alternative proof of the breakthrough result of Davidson and Katsoulis on piecewise conjugate systems. For our purposes we use appropriate compressions of the Fock representation. We then apply this alternative proof locally for the partially defined quantised dynamics. In this way we avoid the topological graphs machinery and pave the way for further applications. These include operator algebras of dynamical systems over commuting contractions or over row commuting contractions."

For that, we use a decomposition algorithm that outputs for any graph G a collection of subgraphs of G with no edge-cutsets inducing a complete bipartite subgraph (a.k.a., splits). The latter collection is sometimes called a split decomposition of G. Furthermore, there exists a generic method in order to design graph algorithms based on split decomposition [Rao, DAM'08]. However, this technique only applies to \"localized\" problems: for which a \"best\" partial solution for any given subgraph in a split decomposition can be computed almost independently from the remaining of the graph. Such framework does not apply to matching problems since an augmenting path may cross the subgraphs arbitrarily. We introduce a new technique that somehow captures all the partial solutions for a given union of subgraphs in a split decomposition, in a compact and amenable way for algorithms - assuming some piecewise linear assumption holds on the value of such solutions. The latter assumption is shown to hold for b-Matching. Doing so, we prove that solving b-Matching on any pair G, b can be reduced in quasi linear-time to solving this problem on a collection of smaller graphs: that are obtained from the subgraphs in any split decomposition of G by replacing every vertex with a constant-size module. In particular, if G has a split decomposition where all subgraphs have order at most a fixed k, then we can solve b-Matching for G, b in O((k log 2 k)$\\times$(m+n)$\\times$log ||b|| 1)-time.

We propose an alternative approach in which the variable ordering algorithm gains 'ordering experience' from training models and uses the learned knowledge for finding good orders. Our methodology is based on offline learning of pair precedence classifiers from training models, that is, learning which variable pair permutation is more likely to lead to a good order. For each training model, a number of training sequences are evaluated. Every training model variable pair permutation is then tagged based on its performance on the evaluated orders. The tagged permutations are then passed through a feature extractor and are given as examples to a classifier creation algorithm. Given a model for which an order is requested, the ordering algorithm consults each precedence classifier and constructs a pair precedence table which is used to create the order. Our algorithm was integrated with SMV, which is one of the most widely used verification systems. Preliminary empirical evaluation of our methodology, using real benchmark models, shows performance that is better than random ordering and is competitive with existing algorithms that use expert knowledge. We believe that in sub-domains of models (alu, caches, etc.) our system will prove even more valuable. This is because it features the ability to learn sub-domain knowledge, something that no other ordering algorithm does."

The objective of the SIGFRIED 1 project is to build a work station for spatial modeling of the exposure of the French population to chemical substances and for identifying the determinants of this exposure. Probabilistic multimedia modeling is used to assess exposure. The epistemological problems associated with the absence of data are overcome by the implementation of tools that apply spatial analysis techniques. An example is furnished for the region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Picardie, for cadmium, nickel and lead exposure. The calculation of exposure is performed for duration of 70 years on the basis of data collected around 2004 fora grid of squares 1 km in length. For example, for Nord-Pas-de-Calais, the indicators allow us to define two areas for cadmium and three for lead. They are linked to the region's industrial history: mining basin, metallurgy activities, and the Lille metropolitan area. The contribution of various exposure pathways varied substantially from one pollutant to another. The exposure maps thus obtained allow us to identify the geographic area where environmental studies must be conducted in priority. The GIS thus constructed is the foundation of a workstation where source emission data, environmental exposure measurements, and finally health and socioeconomic measurements can be combined."

The fraction of early-type galaxies increases with the log of the over-density. A well defined \"red sequence\" composed of early-type galaxies exists in all environments at high luminosity, but it lacks of low luminosity (dwarf) galaxies in the lowest density environment. Conversely low luminosity isolated galaxies are predominantly of late-type. In other words the low luminosity end of the distribution is dominated by red dE galaxies in clusters and groups and by dwarf blue amorphous systems in the lowest density regions. At z=0 we find evidence for strong evolution induced by the environment (Nurture). Transformations take place mostly at low luminosity when star forming dwarf galaxies inhabiting low density environments migrate into amorphous passive dwarf ellipticals in their infall into denser regions. The mechanism involves suppression of the star formation due to gas stripping, without significant mass growth, as proposed by Boselli et al. (2008a). This process is more efficient and fast in ambients of increasing density. In the highest density environments (around clusters) the truncation of the star formation happens fast enough (few 100 Myr) to produce the signature of post-star-burst in galaxy spectra. PSB galaxies, that are in fact found significantly clustered around the largest dynamical units, represent the remnants of star forming isolated galaxies that had their star formation violently suppressed during their infall in clusters in the last 0.5-1.5 Gyrs, and the progenitors of future dEs."

In this work we first elaborate on the meaning of the notion of space-time order in a given configuration which is conceptually at the heart of the path-integral approach to vacuum structure. It is argued that the algorithmic complexity of binary strings associated with coarse-grained descriptions of the configuration provides a relevant quantitative measure. The corresponding ensemble averages define the ranking of different lattice theories at given cutoff by the degree of space-time order generated via their dynamics. We then introduce the set of local transformations of a configuration, chiral orderings, in which the transformed gauge connection represents an effective matrix phase acquired by chiral fermion when hopping over a given link. It is proposed that chiral orderings facilitate the evolution in the set of actions which increases the degree of space-time order while preserving the physical content of the theory, and should thus be used in the search for the fundamental QCD vacuum structure. The relation to renormalization group ideas is discussed, and the first step in general formulation of effective lattice QCD realizing the notion of scale-dependent vacuum structure is given."

The presence and the influence of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies, such as stars or hot Jupiters, are most of the time neglected. In this paper, using numerical simulations and theoretical arguments, we consider several features associated to the elliptical instability in hot-Jupiter systems. In particular, the use of ad hoc boundary conditions makes it possible to estimate the amplitude of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies. We also consider the influence of compressibility on the elliptical instability, and compare the results to the incompressible case. We demonstrate the ability for the elliptical instability to grow in the presence of differential rotation, with a possible synchronized latitude, provided that the tidal deformation and/or the rotation rate of the fluid are large enough. Moreover, the amplitude of the instability for a centrally-condensed mass of fluid is of the same order of magnitude as for an incompressible fluid for a given distance to the threshold of the instability. Finally, we show that the assumption of the elliptical instability being the main tidal dissipation process in eccentric inflated hot Jupiters and misaligned stars is consistent with current data."

However, we observe a clear influence of the age of the baby on the predictions. We improve the performance of this model by enriching the synthetic training set with realistic motion artifacts and over-segmentation of the white matter. Based on extensive visual assessment, we argue that the better performance of the model trained on real T2w data may be due to systematic errors in the ground truth. We propose an original experiment combining two definitions of the ground truth allowing us to show that learning from real data will reproduce any systematic bias from the training set, while synthetic models can avoid this limitation.

We find that a systematic variation of the cloud column densities in a population of matter-bounded clouds is inconsistent with the trends and correlations exhibited by the emission lines in the diagnostic diagrams. Concerning the temperature problem, the only possibility that leads to an overall consistency with the strengths of all other observed emission lines is subsolar metal abundances (as compared to e.g. the presence of dust, the existence of a high-density component, or matter-bounded clouds). In addition, the consequences of the presence of (Galactic-ISM-like) dust internal to the clouds were investigated. These models alleviate the [OIII]-ratio problem but did not lead to overall consistent fits. In our final model series, the NLR is composed of a mixture of metal-depleted (0.5 x solar) clouds with a radius-independent range in densities (10^2 to 10^5 cm^-3) distributed over a range of distances from the nucleus (galactocentric radii from at least $\\sim$ 10^{20} cm to 10^{21.5} cm, for $Q_{tot} = 10^{54}$ s^{-1}). In order to encompass the observed range of each line intensity relative to H$\\beta$, it turns out to be necessary to vary the spectral energy distribution incident on the clouds, qualitatively confirming the findings of Ho et al. (1993). We found a successful continuum sequence by adding an increasing contribution of a hot black body ($T \\approx 200000$ K) to a steep powerlaw ($\\alpha_{uv-x} \\approx -2$).

By early 1914 he came to realise that military force was incompatible with his deepening Christian devotion, and resigned. At the end of 1914 he became full-time paid Assistant Secretary of the newly formed Fellowship of Reconciliation.  A military service tribunal in 1916 allowed him conscientious objector exemption, conditional on Work of National Importance mediated through the Friends Ambulance Unit General Service section. He first worked in a FoR home for disturbed children, trying to put into practice his belief in the goodness of human nature. Then he went to work on sheep farms in the hills of Llyn. However, he began regularly to preach pacifism in the market place, so his exemption was withdrawn. This meant he was sent a notice to report for military training; when he ignored that he was arrested by the civil police and taken before the magistrates, who handed him over to the military. For disobeying orders he was court-martialled (in a depot where he had previously commanded troops) and imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs, London,  and Winson Green. Birmingham, between 1917 and 1919. After the war he worked for a time at Gregynog, for the Misses Davies.\nIn 1923, Davies was elected Member of Parliament for the University of Wales constituency, as an Independent Christian Pacifist, but after the election took the Labour whip, although he never joined any political party. He was thus the only university MP to ever sit on the Labour benches. In 1924, standing again as an Independent Christian Pacifist candidate, he lost the seat to the Liberal Ernest Evans. Thereafter Davies became a Calvinistic Methodist (Presbyterian) minister, serving as pastor in Tywyn and Maethlon between 1926 and 1930. He left to take up work among the unemployed in Rhosllannerchrugog and Brynmawr, and then settled in the Quaker community at Maes-yr-Haf in the Rhondda Valley.  In 1939 he became President of the pacifist organisation, Heddychwyr Cymru, closely associated with the Peace Pledge Union, of which he served as Chair 1946\u20131949.\nIn 1946, Davies settled in North Wales at Dolwyddelan, and he continued to preach outdoors despite deteriorating health. He suffered from depression throughout his life, and in 1949 he committed suicide in North Wales Mental Hospital, Denbigh. He was buried at Dolwyddelan.\nDavies married on 5 February 1916, at Finchley, London, Leslie Eleanor Royde-Smith, sister of author Naomi Royde-Smith. The couple had a daughter, Jane Hedd.\nDavies was the author of various books in Welsh, including Pererindod Heddwch and Profiadau Pellach, about his ministry, and Atgofion Talysarn about his family, and several volumes in English. A Pilgrimage of Peace was posthumously published in 1950.  His brother, John Glyn Davies, was a poet and author."

Slow progress is still progress.\n\nIt may be worth it to try doing your rows with bent knees working up to 3x8-10 before going back to straight legs.   Or stick with the straight legs, but raise the height of the row, work up to 3x8-10, then lower it just a bit.  Same thing with chins: give yourself more assistance until you reach 3x8-10, and then lower back down to 20 lbs. assist.  \n\nOne step backwards is okay if it allows you to take two steps forward.\n\nOther options to help break your plateau: keep everything the same, but add a couple more sets to both pulling motions.  You aren't getting quite enough volume to really force adaptation.  Or try padding your set with slow negatives.  If you are only able to do 5 full-motion reps, add on 3 negatives at the end of each set.\n\nBTW: for pistols, don't add band-assisting on only one side.  Do your weak side first until you fail.  Then do your strong side and stop when you reach the number of reps you were able to do on your weak side.  That is, if you can only do 2 reps on your left, don't do any more than 2 reps on your right side.  This will help you balance your strength. \n\nIf you'd really want to stick with band-assist, be sure to band assist on the right too, but still don't exceed the reps performed on the left.\nporkburp: Thanks for your help here! Sounds like you may have gone through the same issue as me.

        "text": " Java is an example of such a generic API. The recent research on the safe fluent API generation rather focuses on the grammar class that the algorithm can deal with for syntax checking. The key idea of the previous study is to use nested generics to represent a stack structure for the parser built on top of the type system. In that idea, the role of a type parameter was limited to internally representing a stack element of that parser on the type system. The library developers could not use type parameters to include a generic method in their API so that the semantic constraints for their API would be statically checked, for example, the type constraint on the items passed through a stream. Approach: We propose an algorithm to generate a generic fluent API. Our translation algorithm is modeled as the construction of deterministic finite automaton (DFA) with type parameter information. Each state of the DFA holds information about which type parameters are already bound in that state. This information is used to identify whether a method invocation in a chain newly binds a type to a type parameter, or refers to a previously bound type. The identification is required since a type parameter in a chain is bound at a particular method invocation, and that bound type is referred to in the following method invocations. Our algorithm constructs the DFA by analyzing the binding time of type parameters and their propagation among the states in a DFA that is naively constructed from the given grammar. Knowledge and Importance: Our algorithm helps library developers to develop a generic fluent API. The ability to generate a generic fluent API is essential to bring the safe fluent API generation to the real world since the use of type parameters is a common technique in the library API design. By our algorithm, the generation of a safe fluent API will be ready for practical use. Grounding: We implemented a generator named Protocool to demonstrate our algorithm. We also generated several libraries using Protocool to show the ability and the limitations of our algorithm."

        "text": " pairs into quarkonium is as crucial as the melting and dissociation. Thus, phenomenological studies have to account for static screening, dissociation and recombination in a consistent way. But recombination is less understood theoretically than the melting and dissociation. Many studies using semi-classical transport equations model the recombination effect from the consideration of detailed balance at thermal equilibrium. However, these studies cannot explain how the system of quarkonium reaches equilibrium and estimate the time scale of the thermalization. Recently, another approach based on the open quantum system formalism started being used. In this framework, one solves a quantum evolution for in-medium quarkonium. Dissociation and recombination are accounted for consistently. However, the connection between the semi-classical transport equation and the quantum evolution is not clear. In this dissertation, I will try to address the issues raised above. As a warm-up project, I will first study a similar problem: $\\alpha$-$\\alpha$ scattering at the $^8$Be resonance inside an $e^-e^+\\gamma$ plasma. By applying pionless effective field theory and thermal field theory, I will show how the plasma screening effect modifies the $^8$Be resonance energy and width. I will discuss the need to use the open quantum system formalism when studying the time evolution of a system embedded inside a plasma. Then I will use effective field theory of QCD and the open quantum system formalism to derive a Lindblad equation for bound and unbound heavy quark antiquark pairs inside a weakly-coupled QGP. Under the Markovian approximation and the assumption of weak coupling between the system and the environment, the Lindblad equation will be shown to turn to a Boltzmann transport equation if a Wigner transform is applied to the open system density matrix. These assumptions will be justified by using the separation of scales, which is assumed in the construction of effective field theory. I will show the scattering amplitudes that contribute to the collision terms in the Boltzmann equation are gauge invariant and infrared safe. By coupling the transport equation of quarkonium with those of open heavy flavors and solving them using Monte Carlo simulations, I will demonstrate how the system of bound and unbound heavy quark antiquark pairs reaches detailed balance and equilibrium inside the QGP. Phenomenologically, my calculations can describe the experimental data on bottomonium production. Finally I will extend the framework to study the in-medium evolution of heavy diquarks and estimate the production rate of the doubly charmed baryon $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ in heavy ion collisions."

The murder rate has dropped since the 90s, which started out around 9.5 murders per 100,000, and is currently at around 5.\n\nYou were half as likely to be murdered in the United States in 2010s then you were in the 90's\n\nHow is that worse?\njb20x6: Ok you obviously just want to argue needlessly. My point was clear, please read it again.\nthe_ben_obiwan: Ok, keep feeling like the 90s were better because you feel like it's true, if that is really what you want to do, I'm trying to cheer you up with objective facts that say otherwise, not just arguing needlessly\n"

Numerical simulations demonstrate the versatility of the approach, which succeeds in reproducing empirical observations in extremely diverse scenarios, often quantitatively, with a single set of parameters. These scenarios range from collision avoidance involving one, two, or more agents to collective flow properties in unidirectional and bidirectional settings and to the dynamics of evacuation through a bottleneck, where contact forces are directly accessible. Remarkably, a straightforward transcription of digital distraction into the model, by reducing the frequency of decisional updates, suffices to replicate the enhanced chaoticity of the flow, with more frequent sudden turns, observed experimentally when 'smartphone-walking' pedestrians are brought in. Finally, the conceptual transparency of the model makes it easy to pinpoint the origin of some deficiencies, notably its shortsighted account of anticipation (when agents have to cross a group of people) and the disk-like pedestrian shape (when very dense crowds are considered). Our work thus clarifies the singular position of pedestrian crowds in the midst of active-matter systems."

Last but not least, one would like computable and interpretable approximations that can be extended from the empirical Fr{\\'e}chet mean in Rie-mannian manifolds to the empirical exponential barycenters in affine connection manifolds. For distributions that are highly concentrated around their mean, and for any finite number of samples, we establish explicit Taylor expansions on the first and second moment of the empirical mean thanks to a new Taylor expansion of the Riemannian log-map in affine connection spaces. This shows that the empirical mean has a bias in 1/n proportional to the gradient of the curvature tensor contracted twice with the covariance matrix, and a modulation of the convergence rate of the covariance matrix proportional to the covariance-curvature tensor. We show that our non-asymptotic high concentration expansion is consistent with the asymptotic expansion of the BP-CLT. Experiments on constant curvature spaces demonstrate that both expansions are very accurate in their domain of validity. Moreover, the modulation of the convergence rate of the empirical mean's covariance matrix is explicitly encoded using a scalar multiplicative factor that gives an intuitive vision of the impact of the curvature: the variance of the empirical mean decreases faster than in the Euclidean case in negatively curved space forms, with an infinite speed for an infinite negative curvature. This suggests potential links with the stickiness of the Fr{\\'e}chet mean described in stratified spaces. On the contrary, the variance of the empirical mean decreases more slowly than in the Euclidean case in positive curvature space forms, with divergence when we approach the limits of the Karcher \\& Kendall concentration conditions with a uniform distribution on the equator of the sphere, for which the Fr{\\'e}chet mean is not a single point any more."

I just like that \"brilliant\" look of wedding bands made of bright metals like white gold, but having a nickel allergy made titanium basically the only option, so I try to maintain its brightness as much as I can.  7 years in, I'll likely have stopped bothering to polish too, though.\nalheim: I'd like to comment on the obvious: a) your ring will get re-scratched, so you'll be re-polishing every year, and b) every time you hit your ring with the 1000-grit sandpaper, you're wearing down the surface a bit. Do that 30 times and you might have noticeable wear on the ring (depending on the depth of the scratches that you remove). You might not care. And yeah, I too think the natural scuffs &amp; wear look good. But it definitely looks good now! Nice work.\nInTheBay: I think that wear is a good thing, just like with the ring you get after engineering school, as you work it goes from a dull finish to polished, signifying experience\najd6c8: I was supposed to get a special ring?

Further, we show that for more stable graphs, e.g. T-interval connected graphs where the communication links change in every T rounds, the distributed queuing problem can be solved in O(n+ (nk/min(alpha,T))) rounds using the same O(log n) size messages, where alpha > 0 is the concurrency level parameter that captures the minimum number of active queue requests in the system in any round. These results hold in any arbitrary (sequential, one-shot concurrent, or dynamic) arrival of k queue requests in the system. Moreover, our algorithms ensure correctness in the sense that each queue request is eventually enqueued in the distributed queue after it is issued and each queue request is enqueued exactly once. We also provide an impossibility result for this distributed queuing problem in this model.

Show me where in the store I can find period pads marketed to men.\nbclagge: I thought we were talking about products that are unisex but have a special \u201cwomen\u2019s version\u201d that costs more. Men don\u2019t need pads and tampons, so I don\u2019t see how that relates.\nJak03e: We're talking about how women's products in general are overly expensive, particularly ones like pads and tampons that companies know are a  necessity for women's hygine. AKA \"Pink taxes\"\nElectricRook1: For the same reason women pay $60 for the same haircut which a man pays $10. Women have the urge to pay extra to \"pamper themselves.\" Then they brag to their friends how much their hairdo costs, and they have a greater feeling of worth because of it.\nTheVastWaistband: Or....they tend to have a lot more hair and women's styles take longer to do overall\nElectricRook1: if that's what you want to believe, then go ahead.\n\nOne Friday my sister invited me to dinner. She said she was leaving work early, and we'd meet at her hair dressers. I was aghast at the hair dresser running fingers through her hair, primping, and cooing over \"how beautiful your hair is\" that she gave my sister. That is the $40 difference.\n\nAll I ever got from a barber, was locker-room jokes ... he got his $3 tip. The last time I went to a barber was about 1992. We were poor and to save money, my wife bought a $20 hair clipper from Longs. She's cut my hair for the past 27 years. I think we're on our 4 hair clipper, so $80 for 27 years. Less than $3 a year is pretty affordable. The tips are a little different though.\nTheVastWaistband: Are you kidding?\n\nThere are many men only barbershops here set you up with a beer when you walk in. Then they do scalp massage, and do a traditional hot towel treatment and shave with straight razor. They also do nose hair, ear, and unibrow waxing and fingernail filing and buffing.\n\nAlso, you say you don't even go to barbershops and do at home buzzcuts....so you're proclaiming yourself uniquely uninformed in your opinion\nElectricRook1: Why should I waste my money on getting my ego massaged?\nTheVastWaistband: ....you know that taking the time to get a nice haircut and a.shave doesn't mean you're some kind of pussy or faggot right? Maybe you have some sort of insecurity in that area or some self loathing where you don't want to spend money on yourself. Regardless, this is a normal thing for most guys.\nElectricRook1: Yes, maybe I have a loathing to spend money on myself. I don't care what other people do with their money, how they want to spend it, or light it on fire for all I care.\n\nThe fight wakes up in me, when people start talking about how awful it is that they have to pay too much for hygiene products ... when they have brushed off all frugality to buy premium products, then call for price controls when they themselves are the root of poor value by selecting only premium products.\n"

Trust me when I say it will have a tremendous affect on your emotions, your paranoia and anxiety, your thoughts in general, everything about what makes you who you are.\n\nIt's not that only confident, relaxed, chill, awesome people did sports in high school and all that shit. They became that way because they were more active, and being active a lot, depending on the intensity of their physical activities, altered their brain chemistry to give them that kind of confidence and relaxation around large groups of people. It's not the sole factor of course, it's not like every person that exercises and trains a lot becomes a Jersey Shore douche, or Arnold Schwarzenegger, or like Shaq, or any particular athletic celebrity personality. You will still be uniquely you, with all your likes and dislikes being relatively the same, with new interests possibly, except yea you will be more like a confident, more mature, energetic, adult-you.\n\nYou will be less stressed and anxious, you will be more comfortable just talking to people, you'll start feeling like you're in a different state of mind where everything isn't all up in your face and prickling your nerves with anxiety darts and shit. \n\nI used to be afraid of random people at restaurants watching me eat, and one time a cute girl my age sat at a table across from me, and I could not eat the whole time even though she pretty much never looked at me. That's just the tip of the iceberg of how socially anxious and awkward I was. Now I work at one of the most popular casinos, and before that I was a salesmen at a very very high volume sporting goods store, and a teenage fashion clothing store. I made love to a woman the first night we met off Tinder, and we meet up a few times a week now, and it's awesome.\n\nMy social anxiety is pretty much gone. The only time I'm ever socially anxious is when one of the directors of the casino walks in and asks me something, but only on weeks where I feel like I haven't been doing my best.\n\nSo take it from me, find a chance whenever you can each night to do some very slow moderate to heavy lifting, a little meditation and relaxation, and talk to people with certain thoughts in mind that remind you to stop taking every little moment so seriously and just relax and enjoy these moments, especially when you are talking to a beautiful woman, and don't worry about them judging you every single second and trying to always look the best, smell the best, and say the best things. As long as you are putting in somewhat effort to wear clean clothes and shower, and talk with a moderate smile on your face, instead of looking like you are so sad and lifeless that you wanna die (smiling is 100x more attractive than frowning, go ahead and take a picture of yourself doing both faces), you will do just fine.\n\nAnyways yea, go talk to her, and practice those de-stressing techniques.\njtw97: Epic comment.\n"

I haven't purchased one yet, but I'm wondering if it is sufficient. Some videos I've seen on youtube suggest using a rototiller, but the examples I've seen didn't talk about being able to use it on stones. Will the rocks damage the tiller?  Would the smaller stones just fly everywhere? Also, I heard that doing so brings about more weeds as it brings seeds to the surface. \n\nAn excavator is also out of the question simply because there is no way to drive one into the area... yet. I can accept it if the answer is to just slowly comb through the area with the bar, but of course I should explore other options. \n\nRegarding the weeds, I'm also hesitant to resort to weed-killers because of wildlife that roams through. \n\n\nHere are a couple [photos](http://imgur.com/a/n5Bf5) of what the ground looks like.\nLukeDemeo: Not really sure if this will work but I'll give my suggestion anyways, I would suggest going at it with a pick axe to loosen up the soil and rock and then scooping up the loose soil with a shovel to sift it.\nthe_perkolator: This.  Pretty much anything that will pre-break up the dirt so the rock chunks move when your shovel tries to penetrate - a pick axe, breaker bar, roto tiller, etc. even simply softening the dirt with water can help.  The roto tiller is probably the easiest since it involves the least elbow grease, but it can skip and jump around when you hit a larger stone that won't pass through the blades or move away when broken free.\n\nOnce you get a section loose, shovel it out and screen your dirt to remove the rocks.  A simple wood frame with hardware cloth is all you need.  No matter what, if you're agitating the soil the weeds will follow.\n\nGood luck, sounds like you've got quite a project\nIchi-Guren: Yeah I'm both excited at the possibilities but dreading the cost of it all. \n\nThe stone in the third photo is about 2/3 the size of my head. Will those damage a tiller or will the blades simply jam/skip? That's what I'm worried about. Their presence is too uniform throughout the soil to avoid and some are hidden by dirt. I guess hopefully I'm meticulous enough with the pick/bar to find them all?  \nthe_perkolator: In my experience the tiller will skip when they hit one of those rocks, sometimes it'll pull them up and even crush them depending on the tiller and type of rock.  You're likely gonna have to also use a breaker bar or pick axe to dislodge some of these.  Luckily the tiller will make quick work of loosening the areas without big rocks, so you'll be able to more easily spot the ones you need to go back in by hand\n\nEither way, your dirt does look more rocky than anything, in order to get grass to grow you'd likely have to top it off new new soil - so just that will eliminate rocks in the top few inches.  Don't forget to dig trenches to install irrigation for watering it easier, hopefully no boulders deeper under the top :)\n"

These summaries and additional covariates are then included in different prediction methods. To handle a possibly large dimensional history, we rely on machine learning methods adapted to survival data, namely regularized regressions and random survival forests, to predict the event from the landmark time, and we show how they can be combined into a superlearner. Then, the performances are evaluated by cross-validation using estimators of Brier Score and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve adapted to censored data. We demonstrate in a simulation study the benefits of machine learning survival methods over standard survival models, especially in the case of numerous and/or nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the event. We then applied the methodology in two prediction contexts: a clinical context with the prediction of death for patients with primary biliary cholangitis, and a public health context with the prediction of death in the general elderly population at different ages. Our methodology, implemented in R, enables the prediction of an event using the entire longitudinal patient history, even when the number of repeated markers is large. Although introduced with mixed models for the repeated markers and methods for a single right censored time-to-event, our method can be used with any other appropriate modeling technique for the markers and can be easily extended to competing risks setting."

        "text": ". Eliminating these constraints can make model checkers faster. Approach: McMini is an **extensible** model checker based on DPOR (Dynamic Partial Order Reduction). A mechanism was invented to declare to McMini new, primitive thread operations, typically in 100~lines or less of C~code. The mechanism was extended to also allow a user of McMini to declare alternative thread wakeup policies, including spurious wakeups from condition variables. Knowledge: In McMini, the user defines new thread operations. The user optimizes these operations by declaring to the DPOR algorithm information that reduces the number of thread schedules to be searched. One declares: (i) under what conditions an operation is enabled; (ii) which thread operations are independent of each other; and (iii) when two operations can be considered as co-enabled. An optional wakeup policy is implemented by defining when a wait operation (on a semaphore, condition variable, etc.) is enabled. A new enqueue thread operation is described, allowing a user to declare alternative wakeup policies. Grounding: McMini was first confirmed to operate correctly and efficiently as a traditional, but extensible model checker for mutex, semaphore, condition variable, and reader-writer lock. McMini's extensibility was then tested on novel primitive operations, representing other useful paradigms for multithreaded operations. An example is readers-and-two-writers. The speed of model checking was found to be five times faster and more, as compared to traditional implementations on top of condition variables. Alternative wakeup policies (e.g., FIFO, LIFO, arbitrary, etc.) were then tested using an enqueue operation. Finally, spurious wakeups were tested with a program that exposes a bug **only** in the presence of a spurious wakeup. Importance: Many applications employ functions for multithreaded paradigms that go beyond the traditional mutex, semaphore, and condition variables. They are defined on top of basic operations. The ability to directly define new primitives for these paradigms makes model checkers run faster by searching fewer thread schedules. The ability to model particular thread wakeup policies, including spurious wakeup for condition variables, is also important. Note that POSIX leaves undefined the wakeup policies of `pthread_mutex_lock`, `sem_wait`, and `pthread_cond_wait`. The POSIX thread implementation then chooses a particular policy (e.g., FIFO, arbitrary), which can be directly modeled by McMini."

Hand held recorders didn\u2019t even go straight from the recorder to the VCR either, you needed an adapter and not every VCR could play home recorded tapes. Sometimes the adapter ate the tape inside the cassettes too and therefore cousin Becky\u2019s wedding, where only one person could afford a camera, would be lost forever. Sometimes something would come on TV that was super important and a random tape would be grabbed to record it.

        "text": ", Blondel transposes to the triode most of the results he had obtained for the singing arc. In April 1919, he publishes a long memoir in which he introduces the terminology \"self-sustained oscillations\" and proposes to illustrate this concept starting from the example of the Tantalus cup which is then picked up by Van der Pol and Philippe Le Corbeiller. He then provides the definition of a self sustained system which is quite similar to that given later by Aleksandr Andronov and Van der Pol. To study the stability of oscillations sustained by the triode and by the singing arc he uses, this time, a representation in the complex plane and he expresses the amplitude in polar coordinates. He then justifies the maintaining of oscillations by the existence cycles which nearly present all the features of Poincar\\'e's limit cycles. Finally, in November 1919, Blondel performs, a year before Van der Pol, the setting in equation of the triode oscillations. In March 1926, Blondel establishes the differential equation characterizing the oscillations of the singing arc, completely similar to that obtained concomitantly by Van der Pol for the triode. Thus, throughout his career, Blondel, has made fundamental and relatively unknown contributions to the development of the theory of nonlinear oscillations. The purpose of this article is to analyze his main work in this area and to measure their importance or influence by placing them in the perspective of the development of this theory."

We modeled both CRL as a function of FA and FA as a function of CRL. For this, we used a clear methodology and performed regressions with heteroskedastic corrections and robust regressions. The results were compared by cross-validation to retain the equations with the best predictive power. We also studied the errors between observed and predicted values. --- Results --- Data from 513 spontaneous pregnancies allowed to model CRL as a function of age of foetal age. The best model was a polynomial of degree 2. Datation with our equation that models spontaneous pregnancies from a general population was in quite agreement with objective datations obtained from 402 IVF pregnancies and thus support the validity of our model. The most precise measure of CRL was when the SD was minimal (1.83mm), for a CRL of 23.6 mm where our model predicted a 49.4 days of foetal age. Our study allowed to model the SD from 30 to 90 days of foetal age and offers the opportunity of using Zscores in the future to detect growth abnormalities. --- Conclusion --- With powerful statistical tools we report a good modeling of the first trimester embryonic growth in the general population allowing a better knowledge of the date of fertilization useful in the ultrasound screening of Down's syndrome. The optimal period to measure CRL and predict foetal age was 49.4 days (9 weeks of gestational age). Our results open the way to the detection of foetal growth abnormalities using CRL Zscores throughout the first trimester."

Most of science is testing theory against real world evidence.  That's the scientific method, right?   So science at its best assumes no truths/answers.  Most religions do, because most religions are based on generation after generation of experience, compiled into some sort of cumulative text.  So I think most religions began as pseudo-science, even before we called science by the word \"science\".\n\nFurthermore, science is not western.  It's western chauvinism to think that it is.  Non-western countries have just as much science, if they can afford it.  And many of \"western\" scientists hail from non-western countries.  In America, there are many, many, many grad students that came from outside the states, and many of those from non-western countries.  The fact that science \"travels\", as you say, is evidence that its truths are more universal.\n\nIn the end, we can't know completely for sure, but the evidence points to science.  There are some great defenses of science from philosophers.  The only one I can think of right now is Charles S. Peirce, in his \"The Fixation of Belief\".   It's a good question.  Go read more!\n[deleted]: &gt;Most of science is testing theory against real world evidence. \n\nYes, therein lies the problem, it is biased towards empirical kinds of truths, truths that can be sensed with the traditional sense organs, and usually the kinds that can be quantified. This is entirely fine, as such truths are important, the problem is with those views that state that it is really all that there is.\n\nThe problem is, that every time I would try to expand the minds of those who think it is all that there is, they demand their kind of evidence, something that can be heard, seen or measured. \n\nBut this is dumb - in everything that can be heard, seen or measured science is perfectly fine, it is all the other things where science is not enough. Such as metaphysical ideas, or inner experiences.\n\n\nmeadow_at_dusk: The reason that it is biased towards empirical truths is that those are the kind that can be relied on.  Science is in the long run about finding truths we can use.  It is a practical discipline.\n\nIf your truths can't be verified, they might not be useful or dependable.\n"

Doing so, we obtain a \"pruned modular decomposition\", that can be computed in O(m log n)-time. Our main result is that if all the pruned quotient subgraphs have bounded order then a maximum matching can be computed in linear time. This result is mostly based on two pruning rules on pendant and anti-pendant modules -- that are adjacent, respectively, to one or all but one other modules in the graph. Furthermore, these two latter rules are surprisingly intricate and we consider them as our main technical contribution in the paper. We stress that the class of graphs that can be totally decomposed by the pruned modular decomposition contains all the distance-hereditary graphs, and so, it is larger than cographs. In particular, as a byproduct of our approach we also obtain the first known linear-time algorithms for Maximum Matching on distance-hereditary graphs and graphs with modular-treewidth at most one. Finally, we can use an extended version of our framework in order to compute a maximum matching, in linear-time, for all graph classes that can be modularly decomposed into cycles. Our work is the first to explain why the existence of some nice ordering over the modules of a graph, instead of just over its vertices, can help to speed up the computation of maximum matchings on some graph classes."

Another is that the model itself seems particularly natural and worthy of study. Our goal is the systematic characterization of uniform polynomial-size OR circuits, and AND circuits, in terms of known uniform machine-based complexity classes. In particular, we consider the languages reducible to such uniform families of OR circuits, and AND circuits, under a variety of reduction types. We give upper and lower bounds on the computational power of these language classes. We find that these complexity classes are closely related to tallyNL, the set of unary languages within NL, and to sets reducible to tallyNL. Specifically, for a variety of types of reductions (many-one, conjunctive truth table, disjunctive truth table, truth table, Turing) we give characterizations of languages reducible to OR circuit classes in terms of languages reducible to tallyNL classes. Then, some of these OR classes are shown to coincide, and some are proven to be distinct. We give analogous results for AND circuits. Finally, for many of our OR circuit classes, and analogous AND circuit classes, we prove whether or not the two classes coincide, although we leave one such inclusion open."

Even with Earned Income Credit they're better off on welfare and SNAP, especially when factoring the aforementioned \"baby cared for by mother/father instead of a stranger\".\n\nI hope it hurts corporations badly enough that corporate interests will see the need for childcare subsidies.\nPizzaMom14: My husband and I were living your example of higher salary person making $40k per year. (Even though my position requires a master's degree, our incomes are lower because we are both public servants.) We only make it because I work 3 days per week at a job that requires nights and weekends, so we could minimize daycare. Plus thankfully we had a little child care from family. \n\nA few years ago a full-time position opened up at my workplace. My oldest was in half day kindergarten, my middle child was 3 y.o., and I had just given birth to the \"oops, surprise!\" baby. I worked out the numbers to see if I should apply to the position. I would have come out ahead literally $10 a month in pay simply from the daycare costs plus extra work clothes &amp; gas. TEN DOLLARS. That doesn't count extra wear and tear on my minivan, more frequent oil changes, plus the intangibles like time &amp; stress. I didn't apply.\n\nSomething has got to change with the child care and the elder care in this country.\n\nEDIT: We don't qualify for public assistance. (And we don't want it as there are others much worse off.) However, we are close to qualifying for half price lunches, even with my husband working full-time, and us both having \"good\" jobs with the government.\nPotRoastPotato: Ugh... That's so messed up. Good on you guys making the best of a tough situation. I don't see why it needs to be *this* tough for so many.\nPizzaMom14: Thanks. Agreed. We've got to make it better. I'm working with some grassroots organizations around where I live to help with change, slowly but surely.\n"

Although the River Kaveri originated in the Coorg Province, the Coorg province was not included in the agreement. This raises a question about the validity of bilateral agreements between Mysore and Madras presidencies.\nDecades of negotiations between the parties bore no fruit until the Government of India constituted a tribunal in 1990 to look into the matter. After hearing arguments of all the parties involved for the next 16 years, the tribunal delivered its final verdict on 5 February 2007. In its verdict, the tribunal allocated 419 TMC  (11.9 km3) of water annually to Tamil Nadu and 270 TMC (7.6 km3) to Karnataka; 30 TMC  (0.85 km3) of Kaveri river water to Kerala and 7 TMC  (0.2 km3) to Puducherry. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu being the major shareholders, Karnataka was ordered to release 192 TMC (5.4 km3) of water to Tamil Nadu in a normal year from June to May.\nThe dispute, however, did not end there, as all four states decided to file review petitions seeking clarifications and possible renegotiation of the order.\n\nThe first agreement on sharing Kaveri river water dates back to 1892, between Madras Presidency and princely state of Mysuru."

I'm not particularly flexible and my bridge kind of sucks, so I think it's important to keep stretching those muscles to get that synovial fluid in there. Followed up with a few L-Holds, and I was surprised to discover that I can actually hold my legs out almost straight with my butt almost completely off the ground for a couple seconds before collapsing. Couldn't even get my butt off the ground at all a few months ago. I rounded out the stretches with some twist holds and amazingly I can actually lock my hands behind my back on my right side. Left side is still pretty tight but I'm seeing slow progress with a hand towel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn to pushups. I started with just a few conventional pushups to get the blood circulating, and then a few close pushups. I migrated to one of the beer die tables in the backyard and did a few one-arm incline pushups with legs apart at first, then together. Legs together is so much fucking harder it's not even funny, even with such a steep incline. I can feel my feet slipping from underneath me. I'm trying so hard to not rotate my torso when coming back up, and I'm trying to avoid splaying my elbows. Left arm is having a hell of a time keeping up with the right. I transitioned to the ground for some slow and steady close pushups. I've stopped counting and recording reps like I used to, I just go until it hurts but before failure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext were leg raises. Started out on the ground with straight legs, and the next set I moved to the bar. Hanging leg raises are a lot harder for me because I feel more of a strain in my quads, and I tend to swing a little. I tried keeping my core flexed and tight the whole time to avoid swinging, but at this point I feel like I can get my muscles burning more on my back because my stamina is so much less while hanging. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, grip training. Started with some clenched eagle claws, then 2 sets of 5 fingertip pushups to work the tops of the fingers. I did a few hangs from the bar to warm up, and then started some towel hangs. Jesus, is my endurance lower with the towel, and it's not even a thick one. But if I can get up to 30 seconds with the towel I'll be pretty happy with that, as I can do about a minute on the bar. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was it for the day. I went in, made my 1 giant meal for the day, started my fasting timer, and I'll try to hop on the stationary bike later tonight. Just thought I'd share this momentous day of getting off my ass and doing the right thing for a change. I'll keep going this whole week and stop being a lazy fuck.

We find that the electron transport is carried by the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level in all the cases that we have simulated. Relaxation of the junction geometries mainly shifts the relevant occupied molecular levels toward the Fermi energy as well as slightly reduces the broadening of the LUMO level. As a result, the current slightly decreases at low bias voltage. Our calculations also show that placing the molecule in the orientation (1) broadens the LUMO level much more than in the orientation (2), due to the internal structure of the Mn$_{12}$. Consequently, junctions with the former orientation yield a higher current than those with the latter. Among all of the bonding types considered, the Au-C bonding gives rise to the highest current (about one order of magnitude higher than the Au-S bonding), for a given distance between the electrodes. The current through the junction with other bonding types decreases in the order of Au-Au, Au-S, and Au-H. Importantly, the spin-filtering effect in all the nine geometries stays robust and their ratios of the majority-spin to the minority-spin transmission coefficients are in the range of 10$^3$ to 10$^8$. The general trend in transport among the different bonding types and molecular orientations obtained from this study may be applied to other single-molecular magnets."

In this article, we give a full account of Fast Downwards approach to solving multi-valued planning tasks. We extend our earlier discussion of the causal graph heuristic to tasks involving axioms and conditional effects and present some novel techniques for search control that are used within Fast Downwards best-first search algorithm: preferred operators transfer the idea of helpful actions from local search to global best-first search, deferred evaluation of heuristic functions mitigates the negative effect of large branching factors on search performance, and multi-heuristic best-first search combines several heuristic evaluation functions within a single search algorithm in an orthogonal way. We also describe efficient data structures for fast state expansion (successor generators and axiom evaluators) and present a new non-heuristic search algorithm called focused iterative-broadening search, which utilizes the information encoded in causal graphs in a novel way. Fast Downward has proven remarkably successful: It won the \"classical (i.e., propositional, non-optimising) track of the 4th International Planning Competition at ICAPS 2004, following in the footsteps of planners such as FF and LPG. Our experiments show that it also performs very well on the benchmarks of the earlier planning competitions and provide some insights about the usefulness of the new search enhancements."

Here, we attempt to reproduce (same data, same method) and replicate (different data or method) the models described in Nguyen et al. 2021 to predict individual's PD current state and progression using demographic, clinical and neuroimaging features (fALFF and ReHo extracted from resting-state fMRI). We used the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset (PPMI, ppmi-info.org), as in Nguyen et al. 2021 and tried to reproduce the original cohort, imaging features and machine learning models as closely as possible using the information available in the paper and the code. We also investigated methodological variations in cohort selection, feature extraction pipelines and sets of input features. Using the reproduction workflow, we managed to obtain better than chance performance for all our models (R2>0), but this performance remained very different from the ones reported in the original study. The challenges encountered while reproducing and replicating the original work are likely explained by the complexity of neuroimaging studies, in particular in clinical settings. We provide recommendations to facilitate the reproducibility of such studies in the future, for instance with the use of version control tools, standardization of pipelines and publication of analysis code and derived data."

As most of my colleagues sharing this research field, I am confronted with the dilemma of continuing to invest my time and intellectual effort on mathematical morphology as my driving force for research, or simply focussing on how to use deep learning and contributing to it. The solution is not obvious to any of us since our research is not fundamental, it is just oriented to solve challenging problems, which can be more or less theoretical. Certainly, it would be foolish for anyone to claim that deep learning is insignificant or to think that one's favourite image processing domain is productive enough to ignore the state-of-the-art. I fully understand that the labs and leading people in image processing communities have been shifting their research to almost exclusively focus on deep learning techniques. My own position is different: I do think there is room for progress on mathematically grounded image processing branches, under the condition that these are rethought in a broader sense from the deep learning paradigm. Indeed, I firmly believe that the convergence between mathematical morphology and the computation methods which gravitate around deep learning (fully connected networks, convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, recurrent neural networks, etc.) is worthwhile. The goal of this talk is to discuss my personal vision regarding these potential interactions. Without any pretension of being exhaustive, I want to address it with a series of open questions, covering a wide range of specificities of morphological operators and representations, which could be tackled and revisited under the paradigm of deep learning. An expected benefit of such convergence between morphology and deep learning is a cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques between both fields. In addition, I think the future answer to some of these questions can provide some insight on understanding, interpreting and simplifying deep learning networks."

These data indicate that disk lifetimes for solar-mass stars are longer in regions that have lower stellar densities. Through an analysis of multiple epochs of photometry that are available for ~200 Taurus members, we find that stars with disks exhibit significantly greater mid-IR variability than diskless stars. Finally, we have used our data in Taurus to refine the criteria for primordial, evolved, and transitional disks. The number ratio of evolved and transitional disks to primordial disks in Taurus is 15/98 for K5-M5, indicating a timescale of 0.15 x tau(primordial)=0.45 Myr for the clearing of the inner regions of optically thick disks. After applying the same criteria to older clusters (2-10 Myr), we find that the proportions of evolved and transitional disks in those populations are consistent with the measurements in Taurus when their star formation histories are properly taken into account. ERRATUM: In Table 7, we inadvertently omitted the spectral type bins in which class II sources were placed in Table 8 based on their bolometric luminosities (applies only to stars that lack spectroscopic classifications).

Lots of furniture these days, especially cheap stuff that's likely to be around college dorms, is made with either a wood or vinyl veneer, and if it's vinyl then no amount of work will make it look like anything (you can't even really paint it).\n\nFor OP: Veneered wood is very hard to 'sand down to bare wood' because it's only 1/16\" thick with pressboard or chipboard or MDF underneath.  If you accidentally sand through the veneer it will no longer take new stain.  It's possible to remove the old stain, but you need to use a chemical stripping agent rather than just sanding it out.  From experience, this is a gigantic PITA.  A vinyl  veneer is literally just a sheet of plastic that looks like wood; you can't use a stripper on it, nor can you paint it, nor can you sand it.\n\nIf the furniture is wood veneered, I would just rough up the surface by hand with some sandpaper and then prime and paint it, then sand it smooth and seal it.  You won't be able to see the grain, but it is a lot less work than stripping.  OTOH if it's solid wood, then disregard all of this and sand/stain/seal as usual.\nAnsaatsusha: Yea i'm thinking it's Vineer because of the texture, in which if i try to play with it and it turns out poorly like you said if it was, then I will resort to building a bookshelf from scratch.\nreg036: I think some heavy primers might stick to the vinyl and allow you to paint it.

To characterize these processes it is imperative to use the latest technological advances. In this study, it is shown how insights into hydrocarbon migration in source rocks can be obtained by using sequential high resolution synchrotron X-ray tomography. Three-dimensional (3D) images of several immature \"shale\" samples were constructed at resolutions close to 5 micrometers. This is sufficient to resolve the source rock structure down to the grain level, but very fine grained silt particles, clay particles and colloids cannot be resolved. Samples used in this investigation came from the R-8 unit in the upper part of the Green River Shale, which is organic rich, varved, lacustrine marl formed in Eocene Lake Uinta, United States of America. One Green River Shale sample was heated in-situ up to 400{\\deg}C as X-ray tomography images were recorded. The other samples were scanned before and after heating at 400{\\deg}C. During the heating phase, the organic matter was decomposed, and gas was released. Gas expulsion from the low permeability shales was coupled with formation of microcracks. The main technical difficulty was numerical extraction of microcracks that have apertures in the 5 to 30 micrometer range (with 5 micrometers being the resolution limit) from a large 3D volume of X-ray attenuation data. The main goal of the work presented here is to develop a methodology to process these 3D data and image the cracks. This methodology is based on several levels of spatial filtering and automatic recognition of connected domains. Supportive petrographic and thermogravimetric data were an important complement to this study. An investigation of the strain field using two-dimensional image correlation analyses was also performed. As one application of the four-dimensional (4D, space + time) microtomography and the developed workflow, we show that fluid generation was accompanied by crack formation. Under different conditions, in the subsurface, this might provide paths for primary migration."

The low-frequency regime is predicted by a model which consists of coupled sub-structures: the two ribbed areas split by the main bridge and, in most cases, one or two so-called cut-off corners. In order to assess the dynamical properties of each of the subplates (considered here as homogeneous plates), we propose a derivation of the (low-frequency) modal density of an orthotropic homogeneous plate which accounts for the boundary conditions on an arbitrary geometry. Above flim, the soundboard, as seen from a given excitation point, is modelled as a set of three structural wave-guides, namely the three inter-rib spacings surrounding the excitation point. Based on these low- and high-frequency models, computations of the point-mobility and of the apparent modal densities seen at several excitation points match published measurements. The dispersion curve of the wave-guide model displays an acoustical radiation scheme which differs significantly from that of a thin homogeneous plate. It appears that piano dimensioning is such that the subsonic regime of acoustical radiation extends over a much wider frequency range than it would be for a homogeneous plate with the same low-frequency vibration. One problem in piano manufacturing is examined in relationship with the possible radiation schemes induced by the models."

This remark is particularly relevant when H is homogeneous in the fibers (which corresponds to Finsler metrics) or even fiberwise quadratic (which corresponds to Riemannian metrics). In these cases, perturbations by potentials of the Hamiltonian correspond, up to parametrisation, to conformal perturbations of the metric. One of the widely studied aspects is to understand to what extent the return map associated to a periodic orbit can be perturbed by adding a small potential. This kind of question depend strongly on the context in which they are posed. Some of the most studied contexts are, in increasing order of difficulty, perturbations of general vector fields, perturbations of Hamiltonian systems inside the class of Hamiltonian systems, perturbations of Riemannian metrics inside the class of Riemannian metrics, Ma{\\~n}{\\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians. It is for example well-known that each vector field can be perturbed to a vector field with only hyperbolic periodic orbits, this is part of the Kupka-Smale theorem, see [5, 13]. There is no such result in the context of Hamiltonian vector fields, but it remains true that each Hamiltonian can be perturbed to a Hamiltonian with only non-degenerate periodic orbits (including the iterated ones), see [11, 12]. The same result is true in the context of Riemannian metrics: every Riemannian metric can be perturbed to a Riemannian metric with only non-degenerate closed geodesics, this is the bumpy metric theorem, see [4, 2, 1]. The question was investigated only much more recently in the context of Ma{\\~n}{\\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians, see [9, 10]. It is proved in [10] that the same result holds : If H is a convex Hamiltonian and a is a regular value of H, then there exist arbitrarily small potentials u such that all periodic orbits (including iterated ones) of H + u at energy a are non-degenerate. The proof given in [10] is actually rather similar to the ones given in papers on the perturbations of Riemannian metrics. In all these proofs, it is very useful to work"

Regarding intermittency, to account for the persistence of the effect of the large-scales on the dissipation rate, it is further proposed scaling laws for the Reynolds number dependence of the conditional and unconditional acceleration variance using Barenblatt's incomplete similarity framework. It is then shown that both these intermittency and kinematic effects can be combined in a multiplicative cascade process for the acceleration depending on the kinetic energy and the dissipation rate. On the basis of these observations, we introduce a vectorial stochastic model for the dynamics of a tracer in turbulent flows. This model incorporates a fractional log-normal process for the dissipation rate recently proposed, as well as an additional hypothesis regarding non-diagonal terms in the diffusion tensor which naturally leads to the decomposition between tangential and centripetal acceleration. This model is shown to be in good agreement with direct numerical simulations and presents the essential characteristics of the Lagrangian turbulence highlighted in recent years, namely (i) non-Gaussian acceleration, (ii) scale separation between the norm of the acceleration and its components, (iii) anomalous scaling law for the Lagrangian velocity spectra, and (iv) negative skewness of the increments of the mechanical power, reflecting the temporal irreversibility of the dynamics."

We identify several key characteristics of the topology under h^+, concerning the existence/non-existence of unrecognized dead ends, as well as the existence/non-existence of constant upper bounds on the difficulty of escaping local minima and benches. These distinctions divide the (set of all) planning domains into a taxonomy of classes of varying h^+ topology. As it turns out, many of the 30 investigated domains lie in classes with a relatively easy topology. Most particularly, 12 of the domains lie in classes where FFs search algorithm, provided with h^+, is a polynomial solving mechanism. We also present results relating h^+ to its approximation as implemented in FF. The behavior regarding dead ends is provably the same. We summarize the results of an empirical investigation showing that, in many domains, the topological qualities of h^+ are largely inherited by the approximation. The overall investigation gives a rare example of a successful analysis of the connections between typical-case problem structure, and search performance. The theoretical investigation also gives hints on how the topological phenomena might be automatically recognizable by domain analysis techniques.

If so, it might be worth making a one-off appointment with a counselor just to discuss that. Anyway, hard to judge from what you've said. \n\nSo I'd continue to reach out to the acquaintances. Something like, \"Hey, the wife and I are considering doing X this weekend. Any chance you guys would like to join us?\"\n\nIf the answer is they can't, then just say, \"No problem, maybe some other time!\" Keep the energy and enthusiasm level high. You don't want to be giving off negative or disappointed vibes. Check in by text at least once a week.\n\nAt the same, don't invest all your eggs in this one social basket. If there are other couples who have potential, make it a habit to reach out and mention potential things you could do together. A picnic. A show. A barbecue. Go out for dinner. A movie. A farmers market. Go to the gym or the dog park. Hit a garage sale. \n\nIt's easier to make friends when you've got more than one thing going on, and you can issue casual invitations that don't seem high pressure. \"Oh, we're doing this if you're interested. Let us know!\"\n\nDon't get discouraged. I think you're on the right track. Good luck!\nHighlightSame7499: Thank you soooo much for this. I really needed it. It definitely helped me relieve some anxiety/stress with my situation and was very enjoyable to read. I\u2019m going to keep trying because I do want quality friends in my life. One day at a time. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n"

However, existing approaches only cover limited subsets of the above mentioned challenges when applied to the IoT. This paper proposes an integrated approach for addressing the above mentioned challenges. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) a development methodology that separates IoT application development into different concerns and provides a conceptual framework to develop an application, (2) a development framework that implements the development methodology to support actions of stakeholders. The development framework provides a set of modeling languages to specify each development concern and abstracts the scale and heterogeneity related complexity. It integrates code generation, task-mapping, and linking techniques to provide automation. Code generation supports the application development phase by producing a programming framework that allows stakeholders to focus on the application logic, while our mapping and linking techniques together support the deployment phase by producing device-specific code to result in a distributed system collaboratively hosted by individual devices. Our evaluation based on two realistic scenarios shows that the use of our approach improves the productivity of stakeholders involved in the application development."

What exactly is your teacher telling you to focus on in singing with your core?\n\nThere is no one right way to breathe all the time. Someone who only does chest/neck breathing 100% of the time can indicate someone who has a lot of trouble letting themselves relax. Someone who only knows to belly breathe means their belly is shifting in &amp; out.. which means not optimal for doing things that require a lot of core stabilization. And of course it isn't so black/white, it's not like \"you absolutely should not do ANY belly breathing when you're doing ANY kind of exercise at all\" Why are you not sure you got the \"right\" engagement when you were running? \n\nAlso-- no matter what, no one's core is completely off (unless there were some underlying condition), the core is supposed to be on at varying degrees throughout daily life activities.\n\nYou might be overthinking things, but I can't say more about that until you explain more about the connections you saw between the dead bug &amp; your singing teacher's comments.\nCrishy65: You are right, I probably am overthinking it. I just figured even if I don't need it, extra exercises for the inner core muscles can't hurt.\n\nThe connection is in the first part of the deadbug tutorial where he talks about correct breathing; I immediately recognized that from my singing lessons.\nstickysweetastytreat: Based on my conversations with them-- my impression was that the difference is when working out, you need to engage your core to keep everything pulled in whereas singing is more being able to let your belly expand and pull back in to maximize the air you can control with your diaphragm.\nCrishy65: That\u2019s correct - which is why I was only looking at the INNER core muscles, i.e. those that you need for that control and why deadbug made so much sense.\nstickysweetastytreat: Having your deep core engaged means everything is compressed in.

Arab media began using it themselves a decade later. However, its usage still differs between the two languages. In the Western English-language media, only Arab popular sentiment is referred to as the \"street\"; Arabic commentators use the expression in the same sense to refer to not just public opinion in their countries but in the West as well.\nDue to the many negative connotations attached to the use of \"street\" as a modifier, the use of the term in English has been criticized as fostering stereotypes of a population easily roused to violence. The \"Arab street\" thus alternately justifies the need for an authoritarian ruler, or constrains the potentially moderate actions of those rulers. In the wake of the Arab Spring early in the 2010s, the concept of the Arab street has been revisited and challenged. The revolutions that toppled governments have, to some, shown how deficient and outdated Western understandings of Arab public opinion, shaped by the concept of the \"Arab street\", had been and have even led some to suggest it no longer be used. Others, including some Arabs, saw the uprisings as vindicating the importance of public opinion in their cultures and changing the popular concept of the street within them.\n\n"

In these automata, acceptance is defined by a set $\\alpha$ of transitions, and a run is accepting if it traverses transitions in $\\alpha$ only finitely often. This raises the question of canonicity of minimal deterministic and GFG automata with transition-based acceptance. In this paper we study this problem. We start with GFG-tNCWs and show that the safe components (that is, these obtained by restricting the transitions to these not in $\\alpha$) of all minimal GFG-tNCWs are isomorphic, and that by saturating the automaton with transitions in $\\alpha$ we get isomorphism among all minimal GFG-tNCWs. Thus, a canonical form for minimal GFG-tNCWs can be obtained in polynomial time. We continue to DCWs with transition-based acceptance (tDCWs), and their dual tDBWs. We show that here, while no canonical form for minimal automata exists, restricting attention to the safe components is useful, and implies that the only minimal tDCWs that have no canonical form are these for which the transition to the GFG model results in strictly smaller automaton, which do have a canonical minimal form."

Is the programming experience significantly better, or different when programming with a language designed for generic programming without limitations from prior language design choices? Approach: We examine Magnolia, a language designed to embody generic programming. Magnolia is representative of an approach to language design rooted in algebraic specifications. We repeat a well-known experiment, where we put Magnolia's generic programming facilities under scrutiny by implementing a subset of the Boost Graph Library, and reflect on our development experience. Knowledge: We discover that the idioms identified as key features for supporting Stepanov-style generic programming in the previous studies and work on the topic do not tell a full story. We clarify which of them are more of a means to an end, rather than fundamental features for supporting generic programming. Based on the development experience with Magnolia, we identify variadics as an additional key feature for generic programming and point out limitations and challenges of genericity by property. Grounding: Our work uses a well-known framework for evaluating the generic programming facilities of a language from the literature to evaluate the algebraic approach through Magnolia, and we draw comparisons with well-known programming languages. Importance: This work gives a fresh perspective on generic programming, and clarifies what are fundamental language properties and their trade-offs when considering supporting Stepanov-style generic programming. The understanding of how to set the ground for generic programming will inform future language design."

So a considerable period of time passed, but Lyrcus and his wife had no children: and accordingly he made a journey to the oracle at Didyma, to ask how he might obtain offspring; and the answer was , that he would beget a child upon the first woman with whom he should have to do after leaving the shrine. At this, he was mighty pleased, and began to hasten on his homeward journey back to his wife, sure that the prediction was going to be fulfilled according to his wish; but on his voyage, when he arrived at Bybastus(a city in Caria), he was entertained by Staphylus, the son of Dionysus, who received him in the most friendly manner and enticed him to much drinking of wine, and then, when his senses were dulled with drunkenness, united him with his own daughter Hemithea, having had previous intimation of what the sentence of the oracle had been, and desiring to have descendants born to her: but actually a bitter strife arose between Rhoeo and Hemithea, the two daughters of Staphylus, as to which should have the guest, because of a great desire for him by both of the daughters. On the next morning, Lyrcus discovered the trap that his host had laid for him, when he saw Hemithea by his side: he was exceedingly angry, and upbraided Staphylus violently for his treacherous conduct; but finally, seeing that there was nothing to be done, he took off his belt and gave it to the girl, bidding her to keep it until their future offspring had come to man\u2019s estate, so that he might possess a token by which he might be recognized, if he should ever come to his father at Caunus: and so he sailed away home. Aegialus, however, when he heard the whole story about the oracle and about Hemithea, banished him from his country; and there was then a war of great length between the partisans of Lyrcus and those of Aegialus: Hilebia was on the side of the former, for she refused to repudiate her husband. In after years, the son of Lyrcus and Hemithea, whose name was Basilus, came, when he was a grown man, to the Caunian land; and Lyrcus, now an old man, recognized him as his son, and made him ruler over his peoples.\nLyrcus, son of Abas."

        "text": " and basic motivation In the last decades, a lot of efforts has been put into the understanding of limit theory for dependent sequences, including Markov chains (Meyn and Tweedie [42]), weakly dependent sequences (Dedecker et al. [21]), long-range dependent sequences (Doukhan et al. [23], Samorodnitsky [54]), empirical processes (Dehling et al. [22]) and more general structures (Eberlein and Taqqu [25]), to name a few references. A smaller part of the theory was devoted to limit theory under extremal dependence for point processes, maxima, partial sums, tail empirical processes. Resnick [49, 50] started a systematic study of the relations between the convergence of point processes, sums and maxima, see also Resnick [51] for a recent account. He advocated the use of multivariate regular variation as a flexible tool to describe heavy-tail phenomena combined with advanced continuous mapping techniques. For example, maxima and sums are understood as functionals acting on an underlying point process, if the point process converges these functionals converge as well and their limits are described in terms of the points of the limiting point process. Davis and Hsing [13] recognized the power of this approach for limit theory of point processes, maxima, sums, and large deviations for dependent regularly varying processes, i.e., stationary sequences whose finite-dimensional distributions are regularly varying with the same index. Before [13], limit theory for particular regularly varying stationary sequences was studied for the sample mean, maxima, sample autocovariance and autocorrelation functions of linear and bilinear processes with iid regularly varying noise and extreme value theory was considered for regularly varying ARCH processes and solutions to stochastic recurrence equation, see Rootz\\'en [53], Davis and 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

In all these concurrent frameworks, writing reliable software is a serious challenge. Programmers tend to think about code mostly in a sequential way, and it is hard to grasp all possible schedulings of events in a concurrent execution. For similar reasons, verification and analysis of concurrent programs is a difficult task. Testing, which is still the main method for error detection in software, has low coverage for concurrent programs. The reason is that bugs in such programs are difficult to reproduce: they may happen under very specific thread schedules and the likelihood of taking such corner-case schedules is very low. Automated verification, such as model-checking and other traditional exploration techniques, can handle very limited instances of concurrent programs, mostly because of the very large number of possible states and of possible interleavings of executions. Formal analysis of programs requires as a prerequisite a clean mathematical model for programs. Verification of sequential programs starts usually with an abstraction step -- reducing the value domains of variables to finite domains, viewing conditional branching as non-determinism, etc. Another major simplification consists in disallowing recursion. This leads to a very robust computational model, namely finite-state automata and regular languages. Regular languages of words (and trees) are particularly well understood notions. The deep connections between logic and automata revealed by the foundational work of B\\\"uchi, Rabin, and others, are the main ingredients in automata-based verification ."

The perturbation of the binary mixtures by mean of external fields is also an important and recent field of investigation [6]. For example, a laser can induce interesting phenomena in demixing binary mixtures because the radiation pressure can deform the interface between the two phases and it can be used to measure the interface tension [7]. Depending on the nature of the binary mixtures, laser illumination can also lead to a mixing or demixing transition. In ref.[8], focused infrared laser light heats the medium initially in the homogeneous phase and causes a separation in the LCST (Low Critical Solution Temperature) system. The radiation pressure gradients in a laser beam also contribute in the aggregation of polymers , thus producing a phase transition. The local heating may induce thermophoretic forces which attract towards the laser beam one of the binary-mixture components [9]. Other forces like electrostriction can also be involved [10]. In this letter, we report a new phenomenon, which consists in an oscillating phase transition induced by a constant illumination from an infrared laser beam in the heterogeneous region of an UCST (Upper Critical Solution Temperature) binary mixture. Oscillation phenomena in phase transition have already been reported in slow cooling UCST [11],[12] but as far as we know, never induced by a stationary laser illumination.

General purpose languages are inappropriate because their elementary constructs (i.e., variables, functions, loops, etc.) do not match the constructions needed to express music and musical constraints. We show that synchronous programming languages are a much better fit because they rely on temporal constructs that can be directly used to represent musical scores and because their malleability enables composers to experiment easily with artistic variations of their initial scores. The paper mostly focuses on scores programming. It exposes the process a composer should follow from his very first musical intuitions up to the generation of a musical artifact. The paper presents some excerpts of the programming of a classical music composition that it then precisely relates to an actual recording. Examples of techno music and jazz are also presented, with audio artifact, to demonstrate the versatility of the system.

However, due to the difficulties of a direct modeling of flow physics in the scale between the kinetic and hydrodynamic ones, there is basically no reliable theory or valid governing equation to cover the whole transition regime. In fact, it is an unresolved problem about the exact scale for the validity of the NS equations as Reynolds number decreases. The traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is based on the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDE), and it targets on the recovering of the exact solution of the PDEs as mesh size and time step converging to zero. This methodology can be hardly applied here because there is no such a complete PDE for flow physics in all scales. It may be the time to combine the modeling and computation together without going through the process of constructing PDEs. In other words, the CFD research is not only to obtain the numerical solution of governing equation, but also to construct a valid discrete governing equation to identify the flow physics in the mesh size and time step scales. In this paper, we are going to present the idea for the modeling and computation. This methodology leads to the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for flow simulation in all flow regimes. Based on UGKS, the boundary for the validation of the Navier-Stokes equations can be quantitatively evaluated.

Gaussian) if and only if R M is arithmetical (resp. Gaussian) for each maximal ideal M of R. But an example given in [6] shows that a commutative ring which is a locally fqp-ring is not necessarily a fqp-ring. So, in this cited paper the class of fqf-rings is introduced. Each local commutative fqf-ring is a fqp-ring, and a commutative ring is fqf if and only if it is locally fqf. These fqf-rings are defined in [6] without a definition of quasi-flat modules. Here we propose a definition of these modules and another definition of fqf-ring which is equivalent to the one given in [6]. We also introduce the module property of self-flatness. Each quasi-flat module is self-flat but we do not know if the converse holds. On the other hand, each flat module is quasi-flat and any finitely generated module is quasi-flat if and only if it is flat modulo its annihilator. In Section 2 we give a complete characterization of local commutative rings for which each ideal is self-flat. These rings R are fqp and their nilradical N is the subset of zerodivisors of R. In the case where R is not a chain ring for which N = N 2 and R N is not coherent every ideal is flat modulo its annihilator. Then in Section 3 we deduce that any ideal of a chain ring (valuation ring) R is quasi-projective if and only if it is almost maximal and each zerodivisor is nilpotent. This complete the results obtained by Hermann in [11] on valuation domains. In Section 4 we show that each commutative fqf-ring is of $\\lambda$-dimension $\\le$ 3. This extends the result about arithmetical rings obtained in [4]. Moreover it is shown that this $\\lambda$-dimension is $\\le$ 2 in the local case. But an example of a local Gaussian ring R of $\\lambda$-dimension $\\ge$ 3 is given."

        "text": " process, especially for realistic languages such as Java and C++. Approach: In this paper we present Concretely, a technique to extend meta programming systems with pluggable concrete syntax patterns, based on external, black box parsers. We illustrate Concretely in the context of Rascal, an open-source meta programming system and language workbench, and show how to reuse existing parsers for Java, JavaScript, and C++. Furthermore, we propose Tympanic, a DSL to declaratively map external AST structures to Rascal's internal data structures. Tympanic allows implementors of Concretely to solve the impedance mismatch between object-oriented class hierarchies in Java and Rascal's algebraic data types. Both the algebraic data type and AST marshalling code is automatically generated. Knowledge: The conceptual architecture of Concretely and Tympanic supports the reuse of pre-existing, external parsers, and their AST representation in meta programming systems that feature concrete syntax patterns for matching and constructing syntax trees. As such this opens up concrete syntax pattern matching for a host of realistic languages for which writing a grammar from scratch is time consuming and error-prone, but for which industry-strength parsers exist in the wild. Grounding: We evaluate Concretely in terms of source lines of code (SLOC), relative to the size of the AST data type and marshalling code. We show that for real programming languages such as C++ and Java, adding support for concrete syntax patterns takes an effort only in the order of dozens of SLOC. Similarly, we evaluate Tympanic in terms of SLOC, showing an order of magnitude of reduction in SLOC compared to manual implementation of the AST data types and marshalling code. Importance: Meta programming has applications in reverse engineering, reengineering, source code analysis, static analysis, software renovation, domain-specific language engineering, and many others. Processing of syntax trees is central to all of these tasks. Concrete syntax patterns improve the practice of constructing meta programs. The combination of Concretely and Tympanic has the potential to make concrete syntax patterns available with very little effort, thereby improving and promoting the application of meta programming in the general software engineering context."

Due to BASEL III regulations, banks are requested to evaluate the sensitivities of their portfolios every day (risk assessment). Some of these portfolios are huge and sensitivities are time consuming to compute accurately. Faced with the problem of building a software for this task and distrusting automatic differentiation for non-differentiable functions, we turned to an idea developed by Mike Giles called Vibrato. Vibrato at core is a differentiation of a combination of likelihood ratio method and pathwise evaluation. In Giles [12], [13], it is shown that the computing time, stability and precision are enhanced compared with numerical differentiation of the full Monte Carlo path. In many cases, double sensitivities, i.e. second derivatives with respect to parameters, are needed (e.g. gamma hedging). Finite difference approximation of sensitivities is a very simple method but its precision is hard to control because it relies on the appropriate choice of the increment. Automatic differentiation of computer programs bypass the difficulty and its computing cost is similar to finite difference, if not cheaper. But in finance the payoff is never twice differentiable and so generalized derivatives have to be used requiring approximations of Dirac functions of which the precision is also doubtful. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of Vibrato for second and higher derivatives. We will first compare Vibrato applied twice with the analytic differentiation of Vibrato and show that it is equivalent, as the second is easier we propose the best compromise for second derivatives: Automatic Differentiation of Vibrato. In [8], Capriotti has recently investigated the coupling of different mathematical methods -- namely pathwise and likelihood ratio methods -- with an Automatic differ"

We discuss an unexpected 5 MeV excess, observed in the reactor flux energy spectrum, that may be affecting the oscillation interpretation of the short baseline reactor data. We emphasize the care that must be taken in mapping to the true neutrino energy in the case of oscillation experiments that are subject to multiple interaction modes and nuclear effects. We point to problems with the \"Parameter-Goodness-of-Fit test\" that is used to quantify the tension. Lastly, we point out that analyses presenting limits often receive less scrutiny that signals. While we provide a snapshot of the status of sterile neutrino searches today and global fits to their interpretation, we emphasize that this is a fast-moving field. We briefly review experiments that are expected to report new data in the immediate future.

In the case of the time domain radiating system, we have observed that when the charge associated with the current propagating along the radiator reaches the electronic charge, the action associated with the radiation reduces to h/2*pi where h is the Planck constant. In the case of the frequency domain radiating system, we have observed that as the magnitude of the oscillating charge reduces to the electronic charge, the energy dissipated in a single burst of radiation reduces to h*v, where v is the frequency of oscillation. Interestingly, all these results are based purely on classical electrodynamics and general relativity. The importance of the findings is discussed. In particular, the fact that the minimum free charge that exists in nature is the electronic charge, is shown for the first time to be a direct consequence of the photonic nature of the electromagnetic fields. Furthermore, the presented findings allow to derive for the first time an expression for the dark energy density of the universe in terms of the other fundamental constants in nature, the prediction of which is consistent with experimental observations. This Equation, which combines together the dark energy, electronic charge and mass, speed of light, gravitational constant and Planck constant, creates a link between classical field theories (i.e., classical electrodynamics and general relativity) and quantum mechanics."

This paper presents a workflow with partial automation to produce mutants of this form which, notably, are not those produced by mutation-testing tools. Approach: We comb through student tests that fail a correct implementation. The student misconceptions are embedded in these failures. We then use methods to semantically cluster these failures. These clusters are then translated into conceptual mutants. These can then be run against student data to determine whether we they are better than prior methods. Some of these processes also enjoy automation. Knowledge: We find that student misconceptions illustrated by failing tests can be operationalized by the above process. The resulting mutants do much better at identifying student misconceptions. Grounding: Our findings are grounded in a manual analysis of student examples and a quantitative evaluation of both our clustering techniques and our process for making conceptual mutants. The clustering evaluation compares against a ground truth using standard cluster-correspondence measures, while the mutant evaluation examines how conceptual mutants perform against student data. Importance: Our work contributes a workflow, with some automation, to reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of generating conceptually interesting mutants. Such mutants can both improve learning outcomes and reduce student frustration, leading to better educational outcomes. In the process, we also identify a variation of mutation testing not commonly discussed in the software literature."

As Coq programs have to be total and Haskell programs are often not, Mona has to model partiality explicitly in Coq. In her quest for a solution Mona finds an ancient manuscript that explains how properties about Haskell functions can be proven in the proof assistant Agda by translating Haskell programs into monadic Agda programs. By instantiating the monadic program with a concrete monad instance the proof can be performed in either a total or a partial setting. Mona discovers that the proposed transformation does not work in Coq due to a restriction in the termination checker. In fact the transformation does not work in Agda anymore as well, as the termination checker in Agda has been improved. We follow Mona on an educational journey through the land of functional programming where she learns about concepts like free monads and containers as well as basics and restrictions of proof assistants like Coq. These concepts are well-known individually, but their interplay gives rise to a solution for Mona's problem based on the originally proposed monadic tranformation that has not been presented before. When Mona starts to test her approach by proving a statement about simple Haskell functions, she realizes that her approach has an additional advantage over the original idea in Agda. Mona's final solution not only works for a specific monad instance but even allows her to prove monad-generic properties. Instead of proving properties over and over again for specific monad instances she is able to prove properties that hold for all monads representable by a container-based instance of the free monad. In order to strengthen her confidence in the practicability of her approach, Mona evaluates her approach in a case study that compares two implementations for queues. In order to share the results with other functional programmers the fairy tale is available as a literate Coq file.

Speaking to someone who has been through what you're going through is like being cradled in true understanding. \n\n\nMental Health America has a good [list](https://screening.mhanational.org/content/need-talk-someone-warmlines/) of warmlines in the United States.\nelastic-craptastic: As a paranoid depressive, do they demand personal info?  I don't want a log kept on me without express permission.\nKimjongnacca: They make no intrusive demands of you. However, they need some personal info because they keep in touch. They do follow-up calls to make sure you're still OK later. They confer with each other to make sure you're being helped effectively. If they think you are a serious threat to yourself or others, they can send someone to help you; but it's almost exclusively just you having a conversation with an empathetic peer. \n\nBe well my friend.\nelastic-craptastic: I just don't wanna be a debbie downer to my friends but have no one that understands my personal struggles.   They are very specific, and though we all go through shit, I feel like my shit is pretty unique.\n\nBut I don't want my needing to bitch turn into a DSS case as I still take care of my family.  Mental health and stress has ruined families because they have asked for help, in my personal experience. I've seen it and it's better to shut up and suffer than deal with them.\nKimjongnacca: A warmline sounds like an excellent outlet for you.\nelastic-craptastic:  \n\nThanks for the input.  No promises but I'll try.\n"

The problem is known as graph node property prediction and our approach will consist in emulating with help of a Prolog program the key information propagation steps of a Graph Neural Network's training and inference stages. We test our a approach on the ogbn-arxiv node property inference benchmark. To infer class labels for nodes representing papers in a citation network, we distill the dependency trees of the text associated to each node into directed acyclic graphs that we encode as ground Prolog terms. Together with the set of their references to other papers, they become facts in a database on which we reason with help of a Prolog program that mimics the information propagation in graph neural networks predicting node properties. In the process, we invent ground term similarity relations that help infer labels in the test set by propagating node properties from similar nodes in the training set and we evaluate their effectiveness in comparison with that of the graph's link structure. Finally, we implement explanation generators that unveil performance upper bounds inherent to the dataset. As a practical outcome, we obtain a logic program, that, when seen as machine learning algorithm, performs close to the state of the art on the node property prediction benchmark."

Advanced image and video editing techniques are increasingly common in the image processing and computer vision world, and are also starting to be used in media entertainment. One common and difficult task closely linked to the world of video editing is image and video \" inpainting \". Generally speaking, this is the task of replacing the content of an image or video with some other content which is visually pleasing. This subject has been extensively studied in the case of images, to such an extent that commercial image inpainting products destined for the general public are available, such as Photoshop's \" Content Aware fill \" [1]. However, while some impressive results have been obtained in the case of videos, the subject has been studied far less extensively than image inpainting. This relative lack of research can largely be attributed to high time complexity due to the added temporal dimension. Indeed, it has only very recently become possible to produce good quality inpainting results on high definition videos, and this only in a semi-automatic manner. Nevertheless, high-quality video inpainting has many important and useful applications such as film restoration, professional post-production in cinema and video editing for personal use. For this reason, we believe that an automatic, generic video inpainting algorithm would be extremely useful for both academic and professional communities."

You might have to split up the days into push/pull days like in the recommend routine or into verical/horizontal days (my current routine) with rest days inbetween. \n\nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Train everything so that there are no weak links. The choice is upto you though :)\nihatepepperballs: Back and forearms/wrists are my biggest weakness right now, so that's what I'm focusing on.\n\nBy the way: how could I split this into two parts? I would like to do the first half in the morning, then the second one in the afternoon.\n\nThanks for the input :)\nn3ox1ne: Its a 2 day split. For example, Monday would be horizontal day with pushups/rows/core. Tuesday would be rest day and Wednesday would be vertical day with pullups/dips(will move to hspu after getting good stable handstands)/legs. Thursday would be rest and Friday would be horizontal again and it just repeats like that every day, rest, train, rest.\n\nThis is my personal routine modified from the recommend one. It makes sense to me and works for me. It might be different for you. Stick to the recommend routine for 2 or 3 months atleast and then make changes if needed. Good luck and enjoy this journey :D\nihatepepperballs: I feel like that's too much rest time, especially for a teenager. I want action, dammit :D\n\nAre you sure it would be more beneficial to split it into two days when I could do the whole thing in one?\nn3ox1ne: Your recovery time will have to increase especially after progressing to the intermediate movements. The tendons and joints will need more rest between sessions. Otherwise you will overtrain the body and get injured. Remember this is not a race. Take it slow and stay injury free. This is all my opinion though. To praphrase Phi \"Stick to the goddamn recommend routine\" xD\nihatepepperballs: I always feel so lazy on rest days.\n\n*What do you mean I have to ACTIVELY do nothing?*\n\nOh well, I guess it must be so then.\n\nAlso, I love that you used an emoticon after every reply.\n\nxD\nn3ox1ne: You don't have to do nothing (double negatives ftw) on rest days.You can do some running or stretching or yoga or some light sports.

In Neck Fragmentation reactions important Iso-EoS information can be obtained from fragment isospin content, velocity and alignement correlations. The high density symmetry term can be probed from isospin effects on heavy ion reactions at relativistic energies (few AGeV range), in particular for high transverse momentum selections of the reaction products. Rather isospin sensitive observables are proposed from nucleon/cluster emissions, collective flows and meson production. The possibility to shed light on the controversial neutron/proton effective mass splitting in asymmetric matter is also suggested. A large symmetry repulsion at high baryon density will also lead to an \"earlier\" hadron-deconfinement transition in n-rich matter. The binodal transition line of the (T,\\rho_B) diagram is lowered to a region accessible through heavy ion collisions in the energy range of the new planned facilities, e.g. the FAIR/NICA projects. Some observable effects of the formation of a Mixed Phase are suggested, in particular a Neutron Trapping mechanism. The dependence of the results on a suitable treatment of the isovector part of the interaction in effective QCD Lagrangian approaches is critically discussed. We stress the interest of this study in nuclear astrophysics, in particular for supernovae explosions and neutron star structure, where the knowledge of the Iso-EoS is important at low as well as at high baryon density."

It's hard to tell from the photo.  Lots of furniture these days, especially cheap stuff that's likely to be around college dorms, is made with either a wood or vinyl veneer, and if it's vinyl then no amount of work will make it look like anything (you can't even really paint it).\n\nFor OP: Veneered wood is very hard to 'sand down to bare wood' because it's only 1/16\" thick with pressboard or chipboard or MDF underneath.  If you accidentally sand through the veneer it will no longer take new stain.  It's possible to remove the old stain, but you need to use a chemical stripping agent rather than just sanding it out.  From experience, this is a gigantic PITA.  A vinyl  veneer is literally just a sheet of plastic that looks like wood; you can't use a stripper on it, nor can you paint it, nor can you sand it.\n\nIf the furniture is wood veneered, I would just rough up the surface by hand with some sandpaper and then prime and paint it, then sand it smooth and seal it.  You won't be able to see the grain, but it is a lot less work than stripping.  OTOH if it's solid wood, then disregard all of this and sand/stain/seal as usual.\nAnsaatsusha: Yea i'm thinking it's Vineer because of the texture, in which if i try to play with it and it turns out poorly like you said if it was, then I will resort to building a bookshelf from scratch.\nreg036: I think some heavy primers might stick to the vinyl and allow you to paint it.

We obtain metallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn, SNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values from the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity distributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other core-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between metallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs tend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn. Among SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to those of SNe IIL/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower metallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe IIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs (that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe IIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized Cumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II regions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities at higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during SN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM quiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in metallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the progenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly arising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds likely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors, metallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these transients.

The goal of the non-source agents is to quickly converge on the correct opinion, despite having an arbitrary initial configuration, i.e., in a self-stabilizing manner. Once the population converges on the correct opinion, it should remain with it forever. Motivated by biological scenarios in which animals observe and react to the behavior of others, we focus on the extremely constrained model of passive communication, which assumes that when observing another agent the only information that can be extracted is the opinion bit of that agent. We prove that this problem can be solved in a poly-logarithmic in n number of rounds with high probability, while sampling a logarithmic number of agents at each round. Previous works solved this problem faster and using fewer samples, but they did that by decoupling the messages sent by agents from their output opinion, and hence do not fit the framework of passive communication. Moreover, these works use complex recursive algorithms with refined clocks that are unlikely to be used by biological entities. In contrast, our proposed algorithm has a natural appeal as it is based on letting agents estimate the current tendency direction of the dynamics, and then adapt to the emerging trend."

When did humans first come up with the idea of love? Humans identify with love, along with most deep emotions like hatred and jealousy, independently from the rest of the animal kingdom. We believe that we are unique in these feelings and thoughts. In essence, this is correct, no other animal has the human emotion we call love. However that does not mean it has no origin in basic animal instinct.\n\nLove, and other feelings of strong affection for an individual, is simply the advanced form of our reproductive instinct. Love for your children and for your kin is what we humans, with our extremely advanced brains, call the maternal/paternal instinct to protect those who are of our same blood: it is part of the basic animal instinct of advancing the perfect genes through reproduction and protecting those we create. Of course because of our deeper form of thinking, we attribute this form of love to those even not of our gene pool, like adopted children or unrelated cousins.\n\nWhen we attain puberty as humans, we begin a cycle of mindless love and what is socially called \u201cteenage love\u201d, in after which we mature and become more and more critical in how we love. In the world today, the older we get the more knowledgeable on love we become. However that may not be the case. As teenagers, males look for the most attractive female, and females look for the most attractive male, usually regardless of any other aspect like personal attributes. As we get older, we look for these more and more, until eventually as adults, physical attractiveness is very low on the list. This is a result of the animal instinct of finding the perfect mate while using our advanced human minds, which results in an eventual deeper analysis on the individual rather than searching for the physically and genetically perfect mate. Romance, in essence, goes against our animal instinct to reproduce.\n\nLove, in conclusion, is a made up term we use to try and specialize our unique form of the reproduction instinct. Because of our extremely advanced minds, this instinct is made into something much more psychological rather than biological, which is why we end up with situations like parental love for an adopted child, homosexual love, and love for an individual who might not be the best choice for advancing the human gene pool. Love is thus very unique in that sense, and something we must all be grateful for, for it is the only thing that separates us from the anarchic world of the rest of the animal kingdom.\n\nThoughts?\nnbca: It's a chemical reaction in our brain.\nKytro: The emotion certainly is. Your answer though is similar to somebody asking what is in chocolate cake and you say \"atoms\".\n\nBesides the emotion, there are also the concepts of love.\nnbca: Certainly, but most of what was once considered philosophy in regards to love have moved to other sciences as they have been more apt to answer the questions.\n"

Geometrically, stylolites have fractal roughness, with fractal geometrical properties exhibiting typically three scaling regimes: a self-affine scaling with Hurst exponent 1.1+/-0.1 at small scale (up to tens or hundreds of microns), another one with Hurst exponent around 0.5 to 0.6 at intermediate scale (up to millimeters or centimeters), and in the case of sedimentary stylolites, a flat scaling at large scale. More complicated anisotropic scaling (scaling laws depending of the direction of the profile considered) is found in the case of tectonic stylolites. We report models based on first principles from physical chemistry and statistical physics, including a mechanical component for the free-energy associated with stress concentrations, and a precise tracking of the influence of grain-scale heterogeneities and disorder on the resulting (micro)structures. Experimental efforts to reproduce stylolites in the laboratory are also reviewed. We show that although micrometer-size stylolite teeth are obtained in laboratory experiments, teeth deforming numerous grains have not yet been obtained experimentally, which is understandable given the very long formation time of such geometries. Finally, the applications of stylolites as strain and stress markers, to determine paleostress magnitude are reviewed. We show that the scalings in stylolite heights and the crossover scale between these scalings can be used to determine the stress magnitude (its scalar value) perpendicular to the stylolite surface during the stylolite formation, and that the stress anisotropy in the stylolite plane can be determined for the case of tectonic stylolites. We also show that the crossover between medium (millimetric) scales and large (pluricentimetric) scales, in the case of sedimentary stylolites, provides a good marker for the total amount of dissolution, which is still valid even when the largest teeth start to dissolve -- which leads to the loss of information, since the total deformation is not anymore recorded in a single marker structure. We discuss the impact of the stylolites on the evolution of the transport properties of the hosting rock, and show that they promote a permeability increase parallel to the stylolites, whereas their effect on the permeability transverse to the stylolite can be negligible, or may reduce the permeability, depending on the development of the stylolite. Highlights: Stylolite formation depends on rock composition and structure, stress and fluids. Stylolite geometry, fractal and self-affine properties, network structure, are investigated. The experiments and physics-based numerical models for their formation are reviewed. Stylolites can be used as markers of strain, paleostress orientation and magnitude. Stylolites impact transport properties, as function of maturity and flow direction."

The proposed approach identifies a set of influential reactions using species concentrations and reaction rates,with minimal computational cost without requiring additional data or simulations. The new approach is applied to analyze the combustion chemistry of H2 and C3H8 in a constant-volume homogeneous reactor. The influential reactions determined by the sparse-learning method are consistent with the current kinetics knowledge of chemical mechanisms. Additionally, we show that a reduced version of the parent mechanism can be generated as a combination of the significantly reduced influential reactions identified at different times and conditions and that for both H2 and C3H8 fuel, the reduced mechanisms perform closely to the parent mechanisms as a function of the ignition delay time over a wide range of conditions. Our results demonstrate the potential of the sparse-learning approach as an effective and efficient tool for dynamical system analysis and reduction. The uniqueness of this approach as applied to combustion systems lies in the ability to identify influential reactions in specified conditions and times during the evolution of the combustion process. This ability is of great interest to understand chemical reaction systems."

By 1975 the Soviet Union had crept up to somewhere between 40 percent and 60 percent of the American level of GNP\n\n&gt; \u2026\n\n&gt; They realized that the USSR as presently constituted simply could not match a United States that was both a rich consumer society and a global superpower. In the 1970s Gorbachev (then a high apparatchik) was taken to a Canadian supermarket, a cathedral of consumption. He was impressed but suspected a fake Potemkin village stocked for his benefit. He asked his driver to stop unscheduled at a second supermarket. It was just as abundant. Capitalism was a success and the cadres knew it. Their historic aspiration for world leadership sagged.\n\nAccording to *Sources*, the early days of industrialization and military buildup were very successful, bringing high economic growth and especially education. But productivity was always modest due to lacking incentives. And once they had more or less caught up in basic industry, it turned out that central control was not effective for developing a prosperous consumer economy. Inefficient state enterprises don\u2019t go bankrupt, and producers have neither the incentives nor the freedom to create fashionable jeans and avocado toast.\nDrSlightlyLessDoom: Foucault did much better work in describing how power works and is wielded than Mann ever did.

The statistical significance of flow components is tested from analyses performed on subareas of the whole domain. Bootstrapping methods are also used to extract significant flow features required by both gufm1 and COV-OBS. Three main empirical circulation modes emerge, simultaneously constrained by both geomagnetic field models and expected to be robust against the particular a priori used to build them (large scale QG dynamics). Mode 1 exhibits three large vortices at medium/high latitudes, with opposite circulation under the Atlantic and the Pacific hemispheres. Mode 2 interestingly accounts for most of the variations of the Earth's core angular momentum. In this mode, the regions close to the tangent cylinder and to the equator are correlated, and oscillate with a period between 80 and 90 years. Each of these two modes is energetic enough to alter the mean flow, sometimes reinforcing the eccentric gyre, and other times breaking it up into smaller circulations. The three main circulation modes added together to the mean flow account for about 70% of the flows variability, 90% of the root mean square total velocities, and 95% of the secular variation induced by the total flows. Direct physical interpretation of the computed modes is not straightforward. Nonethe-less, similarities found between the two first modes and time/spatial features identified in different studies of core dynamics, suggest that our approach can help to pinpoint the relevant physical processes inside the core on centennial timescales."

In our society that's considered a cardinal sin at a social occasion. It's like being in a group of friends who wish to talk to you and sitting there reading a book. Smartphones, on the other hand, are (in theory) used to socialise with other people, and our society tends to see that as more acceptable. \n\nI'm not saying that I agree with this view. Even if the smartphone user is *actually* talking to friends and not playing Farmville, I don't think it makes it any less potentially rude in a situation where you're (physically) in a group of friends.

Are you refering to changing/spoofing your Modems MAC address? That would in theory work to grab another IP from your ISP as a new MAC would illicit a DHCP request, but most ISPs whitelist modems by the MAC address they require you to give them on first setup. \nauto98: &gt; but most ISPs whitelist modems by the MAC address they require you to give them on first setup.\n\nJust to note that this seems to be a mostly US thing, it doesn't happen in the UK or any other country I have been to.\nThisIsADogHello: I believe the same system works overseas, although in most cases you'll be using a modem provided by your ISP, in which case they already know its MAC address and don't have to ask you for it.\n\nAFAIK, the DOCSIS spec generally only identifies the modem via the modem's MAC address. The only thing really stopping you from spoofing somebody else's MAC is two things: 1. identifying the MAC of a valid customer, and 2. modifying your modem to use this new MAC.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a major deterrent in that it'll be easy for the company to spot that there's two modems claiming to have the same MAC, and they won't have much difficulty in locating which cable segment the modems are on, and send in the police to the location not set as the billing address to deal with some charges of fraud/theft/etc.\nauto98: I work for an ISP, and it definitely isn't the same.

Now, they are saying it's okay when they neglect those morals if it's for something to support.\n\nThat only reinforces the viewpoint that their anti-LGBT donations are pure bigotry rather than pure religion.\nDraknusX: The corporate policy dates back to the first restaurant, before it was a chain. Back then, it was a 24 hour diner, and the owner wanted to ensure that their employees had a day off to relax and worship. The choice of the day was due to their faith, yes, but not due to some misunderstanding of Biblical law. I mean, the Sabbath is on Saturday anyway. They never believed it was a sin to work on Sunday. \n\nAlso, they haven't made a sizable donation to the anti-LGBT non profits that they've donated to before in 6 years. On top of that, only one of those non-profit organizations was actively against matter equality, the rest were just Christian organizations who's leadership, when pressed, didn't support marriage equality, which is hardly surprising, but also didn't really affect how those organizations ran. They've worked to remove anything of the sort from their corporate culture, they started doing so back in 2012 when the hit pieces on the peaked. But rather than count that as a win, because the big bad fast food chain actually learned something and tried to change, everyone still hangs onto the past because it's a lot easier to push the idea that people can't change than it is to admit they attacking people for their ingnorance rather then educating them is just vindictive.\n\nIn 2012 they had a major overhaul that was glossed over by the press. They released multiple statements promising to no longer financially support anti-lgbt organizations, and from all evidence so far they haven't broken that. They've decided to leave the politics to the politicians, at least in these matters. \n\nA quote from one of those statements: \"As we have stated, the Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect \u2014 regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender. We will continue this tradition in the over 1,600 restaurants run by independent Owner/Operators.\" \n\nI don't get why we can't consider a win a win. It worked. They changed. Let their good deeds be good deeds for now. They made a kid's birthday special, no politics, no lobbying, no donations, nothing. They just made a kid's birthday special. \n\n\nClickum245: I was unaware that they had changed their stance on a lot of things. It wasn't something I wanted to actively monitor, so I pretty much wrote them off as a loss after checking that yes, they were (at the time) donating to groups who wanted to push Christian agendas into law.\n\nI'll have to check more into it when I get home, but I am expecting you to be correct.\n"

It's shit like that and $25,000+ helicopter rides that are why we have such high medical costs.\nmasgrada: Honestly, many hospitals are struggling to keep open for many cost related reasons. It's obscene charges like that which keeps them in the black. Otherwise they're nickle and dimed by various insurances or gvt programs below operating costs for routine procedures. However, there are hospitals and hospital chains which are just as shitty. I worked for one recently. \n\nOur whole healthcare system here is one giant clusterfuck. \nSovereignAxe: Yeah, they're having to give obscene charged to patients because they can't stop wasting their money on endless fucking construction projects.\n\nIn the last four years, the hospital in question has remodeled the front entrance three times, added a children's ER, a children's hospital, remodeled the birth center twice, built an in house outpatient pharmacy, remodeled a back door with a new elevator, added a 6 story parking garage, remodeled the trauma units in the ER, renovated several nursing units, relocated half of administration to an offsite building, remodeled that building withing a year of its construction, and is currently building a 70 million dollar surgery center.\n[deleted]: They're competing for top surgeons and improving facilities in order to get more patients with private insurance. I see it all the time. Public hospitals are barely solvent in some cities because Federal subsidies don't even begin to make up for their losses from uninsured patients. This is their attempt to fix the situation. If they can become the best heart specialist in the region, they can improve their finances.\n\nThe other thing that is happening is consolidation. Hospital systems are getting bigger, so they have more power in negotiating with the insurance companies. They're also trying to expand into wealthier suburbs for the same reason listed above.\n"

It is thus important to quantify the uncertainty (or confidence) with which these properties are identified. Here, Bayesian identification is used for this purpose, because it can readily model all the uncertainties in the analysis and measurements, and because it provides the full coupled probability distribution of the identified material properties. In addition, it offers the potential to combine properties identified based on substantially different experiments. The full-field measurement is obtained by moir\\'e interferometry. For computational efficiency the Bayesian approach was applied to a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the displacement fields. The analysis showed that the four orthotropic elastic constants are determined with quite different confidence levels as well as with significant correlation. Comparison with manufacturing specifications showed substantial difference in one constant, and this conclusion agreed with earlier measurement of that constant by a traditional four-point bending test. It is possible that the POD approach did not take full advantage of the copious data provided by the full field measurements, and for that reason that data is provided for others to use (as on line material attached to the article)."

It is proved that when the reversion of creation and annihilation processes is considered in momentum space, under the condition of high energy, a great symmetry violation of time reversal would be caused in some low order processes of electromagnetic interaction just as the Compton scattering in which the propagation lines of fermions are contained. This result contradicts with the experiments of particle physics and is impossible. Meanwhile, it is proved that the normalization processes of the third order vertex angles of electromagnetic interaction also violate time reversal symmetry, no matter in the coordinate space or in the momentum space. But the symmetry violation is small with a magnitude order about 10(-5). The similar problems exist in the current C transformation of quantum field theory. The C transformation of creation and annihilation operator can not be consistent with the C transformation of spinor particle's wave functions in momentum space. We can obtain the correct C transformation of creation and annihilation operator, but can not obtain the correct C transformation of wave functions in momentum space. Therefore, the current rules of C,T transformations in quantum field theory has serious defect and should be redefined."

The position of L2 Pup in the Herzsprung-Russell diagram indicates that this star has a mass around 2 Msun and is probably experiencing an early stage of the asymptotic giant branch. We do not detect any stellar companion of L2 Pup in our adaptive optics and interferometric observations, and we attribute its apparent astrometric wobble in the Hipparcos data to variable lighting effects on its circumstellar material. We however do not exclude the presence of a binary companion, as the large loop structure extending to more than 10 AU to the North-East of the disk in our L band images may be the result of interaction between the stellar wind of L2 Pup and a hidden secondary object.

Also, the majority of people out there / that you're on dates with are doing the same.\n\nNow if you actually commit to someone and are officially dating, and you don't break things off with other people, that's a problem\nNdi_Omuntu: Exactly, just countering the comment I was responding to.\n\n\nThey had a good response though about how variable the definition of \"dating\" is.

To confirm our results we also performed an extensive analytical study, which we use to predict the main excitation process of several diatomic molecules, namely HF, HCl, SiO, CS, and CO. Results. At densities nH = 10^4 cm-3, the excitation of the rotational levels of CH+ is dominated by the radiative pumping of its electronic, vibrational, and rotational states if the intensities of the radiation field at \\sim 0.4, \\sim 4, and \\sim 300 \\mum are stronger than 10^5, 10^8, and 10^4 times those of the local interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Below these values, the chemical pumping is the dominant source of excitation of the J > 1 levels, even at high kinetic temperatures (\\sim 1000 K). The far-infrared emission lines of CH+ observed in the Orion Bar and the NGC 7027 PDRs are consistent with the predictions of our excitation model assuming an incident far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field of \\sim 3 \\times 10^4 (in Draine's unit) and densities of \\sim 5 \\times 10^4 and \\sim 2 \\times 10^5 cm-3. In the case of NGC 7027, the estimate of the density is 10 to 100 times lower than those deduced by traditional excitation codes. Applying our model to other X1\\Sigma+ ground state diatomic molecules, we find that HF, and SiO and HCl are the species the most sensitive to the radiative pumping of their vibrational and bound electronic states. In both cases, the minimal near-infrared and optical/UV radiation field intensities required to modify their rotational level populations are \\sim 10^3 times those of the local ISRF at densities nH = 10^4 cm-3. All these results point towards interstellar and circumstellar media with densities lower than previously established and cast doubts on the clumpiness of well-studied molecular clouds."

In addition to spatial distribution and growth patterns, UFD-T allowed a quantitative analysis of vessel size and length, revealing that the diameter-distribution of vessels remained relatively constant throughout tumor growth. The network is dominated by small vessels at all stages of tumor development with more than 74% of the vessels less than 200 $\\mu$m in diameter. This study also showed that cumulative vessel length is more closely related to tumor radius than volume, indicating that the vascularization becomes insufficient when a critical mass is reached. UFD-T was also compared with dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US) and shown to provide complementary information regarding the link between structure and perfusion. In conclusion, UFD-T is capable of an in vivo quantitative assessment of the development of tumor vasculature (vessels with blood speed >1mm/s (sensitivity limit) assessed with a resolution limit of 80 $\\mu$m) in 3D.

Because organic farmers can't just dump on more nitrogen when the soil is depleted, they are more reliant on using crop rotation, compost, cover crops, etc. \n\nAlso, the limits on pesticide use mean that organic farms aren't in an evolutionary arms race of pesticide vs pest... Whereas pesticide use in conventional farming has led to the spread of [pests that are immune to the available pesticides](http://ocj.com/2015/10/palmer-amaranth-update/).\nCanadairy: &gt; no synthetic fertilizer\n\nTrue, but they can get manure from animals fed feed grown with synthetic fertilizer. So in a roundabout way, they do use synthetic.\n\n&gt; nitrogen runoff is a big problem\n\nTrue, but not limited to synthetic fertilizers or to conventional farming. Organic pig shit can wash into a waterway just as well as conventional pig shit. Runoff prevention is a management issue, not a organic/conventional issue.\n\n&gt; more reliant on using crop rotation, compost, cover crops, etc.\n\nPretty well everyone uses some form of crop rotation. At minimum, corn/soybeans. In my area cash croppers grow corn, soy, wheat, repeat. Occasionally with something like oats, canola, or edible beans tossed in as well. Compost, well if it isn't coming from their farm then it's probably the result of synthetic nitrogen. Cover crops are something that are gaining in popularity in conventional farming, with the caveat that they don't work everywhere. \n\nAs far as pesticides go, organic can still use them. Some of them are far more toxic than the conventional alternatives (especially copper based ones). I've never understood what the point of claiming pesticide resistant weeds is a detriment of using pesticides. If all current pesticides used in conventional agriculture ceased to be effective we'd be back to... organic pest control.\nbizaromo: I think we can both agree that well managed farms (organic or conventional) that control runoff are more \"sustainable\" than organic-or-conventional farms that don't control runoff and let their topsoil go to shit. Not pig shit, per se, just shitty shit. Still, better pig shit than human shit (sorry, I mean sludge, I mean organic bio-solid soil amendment).\n\nJust out of curiosity, what kind of dairy operation do you run? Do you grow your own feed? Or are they (the cows) pastured? I'm guessing they're not organic...\nCanadairy: 60 Jersey cows. We grow our own forages (alfalfa/clover hay and haylage, and corn silage), and buy our grain ration. We had grown grain corn to feed, however we ran into issues with quality and opted to purchase a prepared ration. Pasturing cattle year round really isn't feasible in Canada - too many frostbitten teats and ears, not to mention the lack of grass. The girls spend most of the warm weather outside, but supplemented with more feed at milking time. I wouldn't go organic unless absolutely forced. I like my cows too much to see them die from easily cured infections.\n"

One of the main consequences of our works on Theaetetus' 'mathematical passage', including the present one, is to challenge the so-called 'main standard interpretation'. In particular, following [Ofman2014], we question the claim that Plato praises and glorifies both the mathematician Theodorus and the young Theaetetus. According to our analysis, such a claim, considered as self-evident, entails many errors. Conversely, our analysis of Theaetetus' mathematical mistakes highlights the main cause of some generally overlooked failures in the dialogue: the forgetting of the 'logos', first in the 'mathematical part', then in the following discussion, and finally the failure of the four successive tries of its definition at the end of the dialogue. Namely, as we will show, the passage is closely connected with the problems studied at the end of the dialogue, but also to the two other parts of the trilogy through the method of 'definition by division'. Finally, if our conclusions are different from the usual ones, it is probably because the passage is analyzed, maybe for the first time, simultaneously from the philosophical, historical and mathematical points of view. It had been considered usually either as an excursus by historians of philosophy (for instance [Burnyeat1978]), or as an isolated text separated from the rest of the dialogue by historians of mathematics (for instance [Knorr1975]), or lastly as a pretext to discuss some astute developments in modern mathematics by mathematicians (for instance [Kahane1985]).[Brisson-Ofman1]: Luc Brisson-Salomon Ofman, `Theodorus' lesson in Plato's Theaetetus(147d3-d6) Revisited-A New Perspective', to appear[Brisson-Ofman2]: Luc Brisson-Salomon Ofman, `The Philosophical Interpretation of Plato'sTheaetetus and the Final Part of the Mathematical Lesson (147d7-148b)', to appear[Burnyeat 1978]: Myles Burnyeat, `The Philosophical Sense of Theaetetus' Mathematics',Isis, 69, 1978, 489-514[Kahane1985]: Jean-Pierre Kahane, `la th{\\'e}orie de Th{\\'e}odore des corps quadratiques r{\\'e}els',L'enseignement math{\\'e}matique, 31, 1985, p. 85-92[Knorr1975]: Wilbur Knorr, The evolution of the Euclidean elements, Reidel, 1975[Ofman2014]: Salomon Ofman, `Comprendre les math{\\'e}matiques pour comprendre Platon-Th{\\'e}{\\'e}t{\\`e}te (147d-148b)', Lato Sensu, I, 2014, p. 70-80"

In this work, we propose a self-starting, battery-less, 0.55mm 2 integrated energy harvesting interface based on SECE strategy which has been optimized to work under shock stimulus. Due to the sporadic nature of mechanical shocks which imply long periods of inactivity and brief energy peaks, the interface's average consumption is optimized by minimizing the quiescent power. A dedicated energy saving sequencing has thus been designed, reducing the static current to 30nA and enabling energy to be extracted with only one single 8$\\mu$J shock occurring every 100s. Our SECE-based circuit features a shock FoM 1.6x greater than previous SSHI-based interfaces [4]. The proposed system depicted in Fig.1 is made of a negative voltage converter rectifying the PEH output voltage, and a SECE power path controlled by a sequenced circuit. The sequencing is divided in 4 phases and the associated time diagrams are illustrated in Fig.2. During the sleeping mode T1, all blocks except the shock detection (SD) are turned off. During the starting phase, the energy is stored in CASIC through a cold-start path, increasing VASIC. This will progressively turn on the SD.

Comparing the computational capacities with automata from the classical automata hierarchy, we derive that the families of languages accepted by real-time deterministic (non-erasing) tree-walking-storage automata is located between the regular and the deterministic context-sensitive languages. There is a context-free language that is not accepted by any real-time deterministic tree-walking-storage automaton. On the other hand, these devices accept a unary language in non-erasing mode that cannot be accepted by any classical stack automaton, even in erasing mode and arbitrary time. Basic closure properties of the induced families of languages are shown. In particular, we consider Boolean operations (complementation, union, intersection) and AFL operations (union, intersection with regular languages, homomorphism, inverse homomorphism, concatenation, iteration). It turns out that the two families in question have the same properties and, in particular, share all but one of these closure properties with the important family of deterministic context-free languages."

However, the expected intensity is recovered whentemperature steps higher than 580{\\textdegree}C (i.e. in the range of Ti-poor titanohematites unblockingtemperatures) were excluded from the calculation of archaeointensity and cooling rate correction.In the case of the BK kiln bricks, for which Ti-poor titanohematites does not contributesignificantly to the TRM, all tested cooling rates give average intensities close to the expectedvalue. Incorrectly estimating the duration of the archaeological cooling has therefore a lowimpact on the accuracy of the archaeointensity data on these kinds of material."

Nevertheless the question remains of whether microscopic tubulin trails produced by individual or bundles of several microtubules are intense enough to allow microtubule self-organization at a macroscopic level. In the present work, by simulating the diffusion of tubulin in microtubule solutions at the microscopic scale, we measure the shape and intensity of tubulin trails and discuss about the assumption of microtubule self-organization due to the production of chemical trails by disassembling microtubules. We show that the tubulin trails produced by individual microtubules or small microtubule arrays are very weak and not elongated even at very high reactive rates. Although the variations of concentration due to such trails are not significant compared to natural fluctuations of the concentration of tubuline in the chemical environment, the study shows that heterogeneities of biochemical composition can form due to microtubule disassembly. They could become significant when produced by numerous microtubule ends located in the same place. Their possible formation could play a role in certain conditions of reaction. In particular, it gives a mesoscopic basis to explain the collective dynamics observed in excitable microtubule solutions showing the propagation of concentration waves of microtubules at the millimeter scale, although we doubt that individual microtubules or bundles can behave like molecular ants."

The symbolic representation makes it possible to analyze potentially large sets of states and transitions in a single computation step, thus providing for an efficient implementation. Third, we present CMBP (Conformant Model Based Planner), an efficient implementation of the data structures and algorithm described above, directly based on BDD manipulations, which allows for a compact representation of the search layers and an efficient implementation of the search steps. Finally, we present an experimental comparison of our approach with the state-of-the-art conformant planners CGP, QBFPLAN and GPT. Our analysis includes all the planning problems from the distribution packages of these systems, plus other problems defined to stress a number of specific factors.

Two classes of solutions are found: the usual main sequence solution for the star yields for the planet a mass of 3.67+/-0.13 Mjup, a radius of 1.55+/-0.03 Rjup for an age that is at least 130Ma, and should be less than 500Ma given the star's fast rotation and significant activity. We identify another class of solutions on the pre-main sequence, in which case the planet's mass is 3.45\\pm 0.27 Mjup, its radius is 1.50+/-0.06 Rjup for an age between 30 and 40 Ma. These extremely young solutions provide the simplest explanation for the planet's size which can then be matched by a simple contraction from an initially hot, expanded state, provided the atmospheric opacities are increased by a factor ~3 compared to usual assumptions for solar compositions atmospheres. Other solutions imply in any case that the present inflated radius of CoRoT-2b is transient and the result of an event that occurred less than 20 Ma ago: a giant impact with another Jupiter-mass planet, or interactions with another object in the system which caused a significant rise of the eccentricity followed by the rapid circularization of its orbit. Conclusions: Additional observations of CoRoT-2 that could help understanding this system include searches for infrared excess and the presence of a debris disk and searches for additional companions. The determination of a complete infrared lightcurve including both the primary and secondary transits would also be extremely valuable to constrain the planet's atmospheric properties and to determine the planet-to-star radius ratio in a manner less vulnerable to systematic errors due to stellar activity."

The most frequently used are ENERGY+ [1], ESP-r [2], and TRNSYS [3]. These applications allow an increasing number of models to be integrated, such as airflow, pollutant transport, and daylighting. In the latter category, we may note ENERGY+, ESP-r and ECOTECT [4] software. After more than 20 years of developing a specific code named CODYRUN, we decided to add a lighting module to our software. This paper therefore provides some details on this evolution and elements of validation. The CODYRUN initial software and its validation Developed by the Physics and Mathematical Engineering Laboratory for Energy and Environment at the University of Reunion Island, CODYRUN [5-14] is a multi-zone software program integrating ventilation and moisture transport transfer in buildings. The software employs a zone approach based on nodal analysis and resolves a coupled system describing thermal and airflow phenomena. Numerous validation tests of the CODYRUN code were successfully applied to the software. Apart from the daylighting model, the majority applied the BESTEST procedure [15]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) sponsors a number of programs to improve the use and associated technologies of energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed BESTEST, which is a method based on comparative testing of building simulation programs, on the IEA's behalf. The procedure consists of a series of test cases buildings that are designed to isolate individual aspects of building energy and test the extremes of a program. As the modelling approach is very different between codes, the test cases are specified so that input equivalency can be defined thus allowing the different cases to be modelled by most of codes. The basis for comparison is a range of results from a number of programs considered to be a state-of-art in United States and Europe. Associated with other specific comparisons, a very confident level of validation was obtained for the CODYRUN initial software [8]."

You do FB/Reddit/etc for its content; you'll do the points apps for your personal carrot on a stick (nail polish).\n\nSo now you've doubled the time you're not paying attention to your SO/kids/whatever, or reading books, or whatever _actually healthy_ habits you may have, and literally all you have to show for it is an extra bottle of nail polish.

I'm not above shoveling shit out of a ditch, if I want the carrot at the end of that stick bad enough. Anything else is just wasting time.

Our approach, namely REFeD (data Reuse with Effective Feature Disentanglement for land cover mapping), leverages a disentanglement strategy, based on contrastive learning, where invariant and specific per-domain features are derived to recover the intrinsic information related to the downstream LC mapping task and alleviate possible distribution shifts between domains. Additionally, REFeD is equipped with an effective supervision scheme where feature disentanglement is further enforced via multiple levels of supervision at different granularities. The experimental assessment over two study areas covering extremely diverse and contrasted landscapes, namely Koumbia (located in the West-Africa region, in Burkina Faso) and Centre Val de Loire (located in centre Europe, France), underlines the quality of our framework and the obtained findings demonstrate that out-of-year information coming from the same (or similar) study site, at different periods of time, can constitute a valuable additional source of information to enhance the LC mapping process."

Our brain processes our facial movements at levels we can\u2019t comprehend but while on lsd I noticed what we don\u2019t see with the naked eye is that our face gives away our inner feelings faster than we can see or control. LSD slowed the facial motions down perspectively that\u2019s when i realized our inner feelings are being projected out no matter what. Once I sobered up I noticed people\u2019s faces were back to normal and time was normal. But I couldn\u2019t read there face anymore, besides what they wanted there face to look like. \n\nI think it\u2019s what the human intuition system is based on, subconsciously recognizable facial movements.\n\n\nCrazy trip but all my trips were for cool wisdom or the universe.\n\nThus the need for inner peace.\nmadflowergirl05: Time?

The model was then applied to a patient-specific aortic segment to show its potential in more relevant and complex patient-specific clinical applications. It was found that the G\\&R tends to naturally trigger the aneurysmal dilatation after dissection, in order to restore its tensional equilibrium. Our results indicated that the value of the gain parameter, related to collagen G\\&R, plays an important role in the stability of aortic expansion after cTBAD. A small gain parameter will induce an excessive aneurysmal degeneration whilst a large gain parameter helps to recover a stabilized state of the artery after dissection. Finally, it was found that other mechanobiology-related parameters, such as the circumferential length of the dissection, as well as the pressure in the false lumen, may also be determinant for the stability of aneurysmal dilatation after cTBAD. Both a wide tear and an elevated false lumen pressure favor an unstable development of aortic expansion after cTBAD. As future work, the present model will be validated through predictions of aneurysmal dilatation in patient-specific clinical cases, in comparison with datasets followed over a significant period of time."

Virtual genes and virtual chromosomes were defined to build a simple genetic model that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model. The QTL Cartographer software was used to study QTL detection of simulated plant traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotype for yield maximization based on the model parameters and the associated allelic combination. Key Results and Conclusions: By keeping the environmental factors constant and using a virtual population with a large number of individuals generated by a Mendelian genetic model, results for an ideal case could be simulated. Virtual QTL detection was compared in the case of phenotypic traits - such as cob weight - and when traits were model parameters, and was found to be more accurate in the latter case. The practical interest of this approach is illustrated by calculating the parameters (and the corresponding genotype) associated with yield optimization of a GreenLab maize model. The paper discusses the potentials of GreenLab to represent environment x genotype interactions, in particular through its main state variable, the ratio of biomass supply over demand."

As an undersecretary, he played a major role in developing economic reforms, known as the '24 January decisions,' which paved the way for greater neoliberalism in the Turkish economy. After the coup, he was appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey responsible for the economy in B\u00fclend Ulusu's government and continued to implement economic reforms. He resigned in 1982 following disagreements over economic policy.\u00d6zal formed the Motherland Party (ANAP) in 1983 after the ban on political parties was lifted by the military government. ANAP won a parliamentary majority in the 1983 general election and \u00d6zal subsequently became the Prime Minister of Turkey. While implementing several economic reforms concerning the exchange rate and deregulation, a rise in inflation and the growing conflict with Kurdish separatists led to ANAP winning reduced pluralities in the 1984 local elections. Despite a referendum in 1987 allowing politicians banned during the 1980 coup to resume political activities, ANAP was re-elected with a parliamentary majority in the 1987 general election, albeit with a reduced share of the vote. He survived an assassination attempt during a party congress in 1988. \u00d6zal's foreign policy focused on averting war with Greece following the \u015eim\u015fek Incident and temporarily allowed Bulgarian Turks to emigrate to Turkey.\n\u00d6zal was elected President of the Turkish Republic in the 1989 presidential election, while Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Akbulut replaced him as Prime Minister.

We use the short-wavelength stability method to propose a comprehensive (local) theory of tidal instability at the linear onset, discussing damping effects. Then, we propose a mixing-length theory for the mixing generated by tidal instability in the nonlinear regime. We successfully assess our theoretical predictions against proof-of-concept, direct numerical simulations. Finally, we compare our predictions with the observations of short-period, double-lined spectroscopic binary systems. Using new analytical results, cross-validated by a direct integration of the stability equations, we show that tidal instability can be generated by nonlinear couplings of inertia-gravity waves with the equilibrium tidal flow in short-period massive binaries, even against the Joule diffusion. In the nonlinear regime, a fossil magnetic field can be dissipated by the turbulent magnetic diffusion induced by the saturated tidal flows. We predict that the turbulent Joule diffusion of fossil fields would occur in a few million years for several short-period massive binaries. Therefore, turbulent tidal flows could explain the observed dearth of some short-period magnetic binaries."

However, the participants using only the video tutorial applied the learned content faster, achieving roughly the same bottom line performance. We also found that if both tutorial types are offered, participants prefer video tutorials for learning new content but text tutorials for looking up \"missed\" information. We mainly gathered our data through questionnaires and screen recordings and analyzed it with suitable statistical hypotheses tests. The data is available at [12]. Since producing tutorials requires effort, knowing with which type of tutorial learnability can be increased to which extent has an immense practical relevance.

I have a lot of depression and I\u2019m still living with an ed and trauma lol that\u2019s bout it but idk if there\u2019s anything more?\nStrongWarmSweet: That\u2019s probably it.

I would take it as genuine feedback.\nAquaticUndercover: If they wanted to invite me out then they would\u2019ve right there instead of redirecting me\nStrongWarmSweet: Well yeah but I mean they may be rejecting you because they perceive you to be depressed. Unfortunately that can happen, which creates more depression. It can be a vicious cycle.\nAquaticUndercover: Maybe you are right but if I\u2019m depressed then surely the logical thing to do would be to make sure I\u2019m ok like inviting me out or smth idk. Even if I force a smile and I\u2019m more welcoming I don\u2019t feel like it makes me any closer to people usually they just feel like it\u2019s easier to ask me for favors :/\nStrongWarmSweet: Yeah I agree. People can be awful like that. I tend to have the same experience tbh. I have friends but not many and I tend to run into a lot of entitled people too. It is depressing. \n\nHave you tried meetups?\nAquaticUndercover: I\u2019ve sort of seen the app is it good?\nStrongWarmSweet: I have just a few friends. Two from back in high school that I see once or twice a year. One from uni I see monthly. One I met in a church group I see once or twice a year. Another I met on meetup that I see monthly. I am also in a relationship with someone I met in uni. But I recommend finding a few buddies before looking for a relationship because that\u2019s easier. \n\nSo yeah my go-to for myself is school, church and meet up apparently. Don\u2019t worry if the one-on-one hangouts are infrequent because over the years it ends up meaning something. \n\nMeet up is good because you can enjoy a hobby at the same time.

In addition to the growth of interfacial instabilities at the inner interface, we observe a transient withdrawal of the suspension and the formation of fingering instabilities at the outer interface. We demonstrate that these `reverse fingering' instabilities are extremely sensitive to the injection flow rate of water, the gap of the Hele-Shaw cell and the concentration of the displaced cornstarch suspension, {and emerge irrespective of immiscibility between the fluid pair. We believe that as the cornstarch suspension dilates due to the high shear rate imposed by the displacing fluid, the outer suspension-air interface responds with a restoring force, resulting in the penetration of air into the suspension and the formation of reverse fingers. We note that the growth of reverse fingers significantly reduces the displacement efficiency of the suspension. Finally, we demonstrate a correlation in the growth of inner and outer interfacial patterns by computing the velocity with which stresses propagate in the confined dense suspension. Our findings are useful in understanding the flow of granular materials through constrained geometries and can be extended to study stress propagation in shear-thickening materials due to a sudden imposition of high shear rate, such as in impact behaviour."

Finally, the design is energy-efficient: if input species are specified ideally (meaning absolutely 0 concentration of unwanted species), then output species converge to their ideal concentrations at steady-state, and the system at steady-state is in (dynamic) equilibrium, meaning that no energy is consumed by irreversible reactions until the input again changes. Drawbacks of our design include the following. If input is provided non-ideally (small positive concentration of unwanted species), then energy must be continually expended to maintain correct output concentrations even at steady-state. In addition, our fuel species - those species that are permanently consumed in irreversible reactions - are not \"generic\"; each gate in the circuit is powered by its own specific type of fuel species. Hence different circuits must be powered by different types of fuel. Finally, we require input to be given according to the dual-rail convention, so that an input of 0 is specified not only by the absence of a certain species, but by the presence of another. That is, we do not construct a \"true NOT gate\" that sets its output to high concentration if and only if its input's concentration is low. It remains an open problem to design scalable, time-responsive, digital, energy-efficient molecular circuits that additionally solve one of these problems, or to prove that some subset of their resolutions are mutually incompatible."

Most of science is testing theory against real world evidence.  That's the scientific method, right?   So science at its best assumes no truths/answers.  Most religions do, because most religions are based on generation after generation of experience, compiled into some sort of cumulative text.  So I think most religions began as pseudo-science, even before we called science by the word \"science\".\n\nFurthermore, science is not western.  It's western chauvinism to think that it is.  Non-western countries have just as much science, if they can afford it.  And many of \"western\" scientists hail from non-western countries.  In America, there are many, many, many grad students that came from outside the states, and many of those from non-western countries.  The fact that science \"travels\", as you say, is evidence that its truths are more universal.\n\nIn the end, we can't know completely for sure, but the evidence points to science.  There are some great defenses of science from philosophers.  The only one I can think of right now is Charles S. Peirce, in his \"The Fixation of Belief\".   It's a good question.  Go read more!\n[deleted]: &gt;Most of science is testing theory against real world evidence. \n\nYes, therein lies the problem, it is biased towards empirical kinds of truths, truths that can be sensed with the traditional sense organs, and usually the kinds that can be quantified. This is entirely fine, as such truths are important, the problem is with those views that state that it is really all that there is.\n\nThe problem is, that every time I would try to expand the minds of those who think it is all that there is, they demand their kind of evidence, something that can be heard, seen or measured. \n\nBut this is dumb - in everything that can be heard, seen or measured science is perfectly fine, it is all the other things where science is not enough. Such as metaphysical ideas, or inner experiences.\n\n\nmeadow_at_dusk: The reason that it is biased towards empirical truths is that those are the kind that can be relied on.  Science is in the long run about finding truths we can use.  It is a practical discipline.\n\nIf your truths can't be verified, they might not be useful or dependable.\n"

In their book The Fourth Turning (1997), the authors expanded the theory to focus on a fourfold cycle of generational types and recurring mood eras to describe the history of the United States, including the Thirteen Colonies and their British antecedents. However, the authors have also examined generational trends elsewhere in the world and described similar cycles in several developed countries.\nAcademic response to the theory has been mixed, with some applauding Strauss and Howe for their \"bold and imaginative thesis\", while others have criticized the theory as being overly deterministic, unfalsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who graduated from Harvard University with Strauss, called Generations the most stimulating book on American history he'd ever read, and even sent a copy to each member of Congress. The theory has been influential in the fields of generational studies, marketing, and business management literature. However, the theory has also been described by some historians and journalists as pseudoscientific, \"kooky\", and \"an elaborate historical horoscope that will never withstand scholarly scrutiny\". Academic criticism has focused on the lack of rigorous empirical evidence for their claims, as well as the authors' view that generational groupings are more powerful than other social groupings, such as economic class, race, sex, religion, and political parties."

We show how multivariate and embedded feature selection allows the building of optimized predictor sets of reduced complexity, and we identify features particularly relevant for coastal and riverine scene descriptions. Our results show the importance of dual-cloud features, lidar return-based attributes averaged over specific scales, and of statistics of dimensionality-based and spectral features. Additionally, they indicate that small to medium spherical neighbourhood diameters (<7 m) are sufficient to build effective classifiers, namely when combined with distance-to-ground or distance-to-water-surface features. Without using optional RGB information, and with a maximum of 37 descriptors, we obtain classification accuracies between 91 % for complex multi-class tasks and 98 % for lower-level processing using models trained on less than 2000 samples per class. Comparisons with classical point cloud classification methods show that 3DMASC features have a significantly improved descriptive power. Our contributions are made available through a plugin in the CloudCompare software, allowing non-specialist users to create classifiers for any type of 3D data characterized by 1 or 2 point clouds (airborne or terrestrial lidar, structure from motion), and two labelled topo-bathymetric lidar datasets, available on https://opentopography.org/."

In addition, we compare the photometric metallicities with published spectroscopic metallicities based on spectral synthesis and medium-resolution spectroscopy, and on high resolution spectra where available. Results. The mean properties of the spectroscopic and photometric metallicity samples are comparable within the intrinsic scatter of each method although the mean metallicities of dSphs with pronounced intermediate-age population fractions may be underestimated by the photometric method by up to a few tenths of dex in [Fe/H]. The star-by-star differences of the spectroscopic minus the photometric metallicities show a wide range of values along the fiducial spectroscopic metallicity range, with the tendency to have systematically lower photometric metallicities for those dwarf spheroidals with a higher fraction of intermediate-age populations. Such discrepancies persist even in the case of the purely old Sculptor dSph, where one would na\\\"ively expect a very good match when comparing with medium or low resolution metallicity measurements. Overall, the agreement between Ca T metallicities and photometric metallicities is very good in the metallicity range from ~ -2 dex to ~ -1.5 dex. We find that the photometric method is reliable in galaxies that contain small (less than 15%) intermediate-age stellar fractions. Therefore, in the presence of mixed-age stellar populations, one needs to quantify the fraction of the intermediate-age stars in order to assess their effect on determining metallicities from photometry alone. Finally, we note that the comparison of spectroscopic metallicities of the same stars obtained with different methods reveals similarly large discrepancies as the comparison with photometric metallicities."

When you feel good about yourself, you don't think negatively about yourself and thus you'll stop assuming others view you or will view you in a negative light. And if they do, so what you'll have the emotional stability to deal with someone rejecting you or not liking you.\n\nTo start raising your self-esteem, write down good things about yourself. Listen to the people who love you and who've been there. For example don't discount good things your mom or grandma has to say about you, they're not just saying it because.\nBarcaLiverpool: Very well said!\n\nI have made several significant changes in my lifestyle in order to better myself. I go to gym 4-5 days a week, have set meal plan, focused on hygiene, began reading books instead of surfing through internet \n\nBut even after these improvements I still have low self esteem.

Love you mom and dad!\nMadwoman-of-Chaillot: I was laid off two weeks after my husband and I had just bought our house (a fixer-upper, b/c that's all we could afford). We struggled to pay the mortgage, and our hot water heater broke. We couldn't afford to fix it. So that whole winter, we heated up water on the stove so that we could bathe. Our furnace blew out on New Year's Eve, too, so we spent a cozy few weeks huddled with the dogs in front of the fireplace. I'm oddly glad that those things happened because I don't take anything for granted anymore.\nMiss_Bloody_Bonnie: One of my most fond memories started with a broken water heater. I had moved back to the state my SO lived in and we were temporarily staying with his parents. I was the only one with a job at the moment (FIL retired, MIL looking for a job, SO laid off and looking). I worked graveyard and the hot water heater was broken so I bathed with cold water in March which is quite chilly here. I woke up one night dreading my cold bucket \"shower\", but heard a lot of commotion outside the room. My in-laws and bf were all heating water in multiple pots and filling the tub so I could take a warm bath. My FIL said you're the only one who has to go to work right now, it's the least we can we do. That melted my heart.

Only problem is I was out muscled for the first time ever at my last comp and I didn't like it. Also, I feel like being able to do cool stuff like handstand pushups, L-sits and levers, sue me. \n\nAnyways, my current workout schedule looks like:\n\nMWF:\nBJJ and boxing\n\nTu, Sa:\nStartbodyweight.com routine\nBJJ in the morning depending on work\n\nTh, Su:\nYoga\nBJJ in the morning depending on work\n\nI eat pretty healthy foods, staying around 2400-2800 calories a day, except on my yoga days where it's closer to 2200. I'm a vegetarian so I don't get as much protein as most might from their food, but it's pretty adequate, plus I do drink a protein shake daily. I eat mostly fruits and veggies, quinoa, some veggie burgers (shit's expensive, yo), peanut butter, and oatmeal. Soda maybe once or twice per year, chips and crappy snacks maybe once a month. \n\nMy question is, will bodyweight fitness put on a lot of muscle? How hard can I expect to plateau, eventually (I'm no stranger to plateaus, they happen quite frequently in jiu jitsu and I've seen them mentioned a bit here)? Anyone else in the same, or a similar, boat?\nADDSail: It doesn't put on as much muscle as lifting weights would in the same amount of time. You will for sure get stronger and depending on your diet, get bigger if you eat above your TDEE. You can make sure you gain minimal size by controlling your diet and (arguably) staying in strength related rep ranges of 3-5 reps per set. \n\nAs for plateaus, with proper training, diet, consistency and patience you can bust out of them pretty quickly. Obviously skills like the planche may not include measurable progress every session. If you're just starting plateaus are not something to worry about. Given perfect circumstances, strength will go up every 1-2-3 workouts for a long time. \n\nGreat idea to supplement BJJ with BWF. I casually rolled with a V10 level rock climber once and the grip strength was on another level. Inescapable wrist control, even when sweaty. \neman_resu_tluafed: I go back and forth between deficit and surplus every day or so. I mostly go for maintenance but I have cut out some cardio and circuit training to be able to do BWF. \n\nOn another note, one of the guys I trained with at my old gym was a rock concert and former stone mason. His collar grips were unbreakable. \nADDSail: Yeah day to day variance is fine. If you don't want to cut cardio and circuit training you can just eat a little bit more. But if you're rolling every day you probably don't need too much supplementary conditioning. I always think it's insane how 45 minutes jogging on a treadmill doesn't even add up to a Big Mac calorie-wise. \n\nGi? Booo. \neman_resu_tluafed: Don't like the gi?\n"

I'm having trouble understanding how someone accepting a risk can come back on someone else.\nflamingfireworks: eh, not really.\n\nFor one, (depending on the lawyer, county, etc) it can be argued the waiver is signed under duress or unfair circumstances.

The observed behavior is related to the dipolar interaction (DI) between NP which seems to be an important mechanism in all samples studied. This is supported by the results of the ac magnetic susceptibility Xac measurements, where the temperature in which X' peaks for different frequencies follows the Vogel-Fulcher model, a feature commonly found in systems with dipolar interactions. Curves of H vs. TB/TB(H=0) for samples with different coatings and magnetite concentrations collapse into a universal curve, indicating that the qualitative magnetic behavior of the samples may be described by the NP themselves, instead of the coating or the strength of the dipolar interaction. Below TB, M vs. H curves show a coercive field (HC) that increases monotonically with decreasing temperature. The saturation magnetization (MS) follows the Bloch's law and values of MS at room temperature as high as 78 emu/g were estimated, a result corresponding to ~80% of the bulk value. The overlap of M/MS vs. H/T curves for a given sample and the low HC at high temperatures suggest superparamagnetic behavior in all samples studied. The overlap of M/MS vs. H curves at constant temperature for different samples indicates that the NP magnetization behavior is preserved, independently of the coating and magnetite concentration."

Whereas our previous work focused on the background fields that describe potential long-term equilibria, here we compute the transition functions of individual agents and study their probabilistic dynamics in the background field, as a function of their initial state. We show that capital accumulation depends on various factors. The probability associated with each firm's trajectories is the result of several contradictory effects: the firm tends to shift towards sectors with the greatest long-term return, but must take into account the impact of its shift on its attractiveness for investors throughout its trajectory. Since this trajectory depends largely on the average capital of transition sectors, a firm's attractiveness during its relocation depends on the relative level of capital in those sectors. Thus, an under-capitalized firm reaching a high-capital sector will experience a loss of attractiveness, and subsequently, in investors. Moreover, the firm must also consider the effects of competition in the intermediate sectors. An under-capitalized firm will tend to be ousted out towards sectors with lower average capital, while an over-capitalized firm will tend to shift towards higher averagecapital sectors. For investors, capital allocation depends on their short and long-term returns. These returns are not independent: in the short-term, returns are composed of both the firm's dividends and the increase in its stock prices. In the long-term, returns are based on the firm's growth expectations, but also, indirectly, on expectations of higher stock prices. Investors' capital allocation directly depends on the volatility of stock prices and {\\ldots}rms'dividends. Investors will tend to reallocate their capital to maximize their short and long-term returns. The higher their level of capital, the stronger the reallocation will be."

If you went to a local tourist spot in downtown Dehli, you might think it's authentic, but it's geared to tourists who come to India to see \"authentic \" Indian culture and eat authentic Indian food while ignoring that they are doing so in a place that makes millions of dollars in the tourism business and know how to cater to American adventure seekers.  Tourism is a major industry.  \n\nAnd as I said, most of the tourists I know who visit other countries are doing exactly that.  They go to Cancun or Puerta Vallarta, San Juan, or Tokyo or Seoul.  Places that every American visiting those countries goes to.  Many of them never leave the downtown area for more than a day.  So you essentially see the Disney version of those cultures where it's all made to look unique while being completely chewed on to not offend American sensibility or tastebuds.

This enables library writers to check for invalid input or program states and thus, for example, to implement custom error handling that maintains system availability and does not terminate on benign errors. As we assume that introspection is used together with a dynamic tool that implements automatic checks, errors that are not handled in the application logic continue to cause the dynamic tool to abort execution. Knowledge: Using the introspection interface, we implemented a more robust, source-compatible version of the C standard library that validates parameters to its functions. The library functions react to otherwise undefined behavior; for example, they can detect lurking flaws, handle unterminated strings, check format string arguments, and set errno when they detect benign usage errors. Grounding: Existing dynamic tools maintain run-time information that can be used to implement the introspection interface, and we demonstrate its implementation in Safe Sulong, an interpreter and dynamic bug-finding tool for C that runs on a Java Virtual Machine and can thus easily expose relevant run-time information. Importance: Using introspection in user code is a novel approach to tackling the long-standing problem of low-level errors in C. As new approaches are lowering the performance overhead of run-time information maintenance, the usage of dynamic runtimes for C could become more common, which could ultimately facilitate a more widespread implementation of such an introspection interface."

We have a demonstrative video and examples that illustrate our approach on dynamic software adaptation, aspect-oriented programming, debugging and context-aware interpreters. Importance: To our knowledge, our paper presents the first reflective approach targeting a general framework for language development. Our system provides full reflective support for free to any Neverlang-based interpreter. We are not aware of any prior application of open implementations to programming language interpreters in the sense defined in this paper. Rather than substituting other approaches, we believe our system can be used as a complementary technique in situations where other approaches present serious limitations."

Since closed-form expressions of the marginal likelihood are generally not available, numerical approximations based on MCMC samples have been suggested. For certain special cases, simplified algebraic expressions can be derived; for instance, the Savage\u2013Dickey density ratio in the case of a precise (equality constrained) hypothesis against an unrestricted alternative. Another approximation, derived by applying Laplace's approximation to the integrated likelihoods, is known as the Bayesian information criterion (BIC); in large data sets the Bayes factor will approach the BIC as the influence of the priors wanes. In small data sets, priors generally matter and must not be improper since the Bayes factor will be undefined if either of the two integrals in its ratio is not finite.\n\n"

In molecular tagging approach, a very small percentage of tracer molecules are introduced into the gas of interest, referred as carrier gas. In gas flow studies, the typical tracers employed are acetone and biacetyl. These tracer molecules, assumed to be in equilibrium with the carrier gas, are excited with a source of energy at a specific wavelength, typically a laser. The excited molecules are unstable and tend to de-excite in a radiative and non-radiative manner, which is manifested as fluorescence and phosphorescence. Following the deformation with time of a tagged line permits to obtain the flow velocity. In addition, the dependence of the phosphorescence and fluorescence intensity to the gas temperature could also allow to use this technique for local temperature measurements. The objective of this study is to develop an experimental setup capable of simultaneously mapping the wall and fluid near-wall temperatures with the final goal to measure temperature jump at the wall when rarefied conditions are reached. The originality of this setup shown in Figure 1 is to couple surface temperature measurements using an infrared camera with Molecular Tagging Thermometry (MTT) for gas temperature measurements. The bottom wall of the channel will be made of Sapphire substrate of 650 $\\mu$m thickness coated with a thin film of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). The average roughness of this ITO layer is about 3 nm.

We also gathered bibliographic information such as related keywords and prominent publications. Besides other characteristics the results show that the field of exploratory programming is mostly about technical designs and empirical studies on tools for general-purpose programming. In contrast, publications on live coding have the most variety in their motivations and methodologies with a majority being empirical studies with users. As expected, most publications on live coding are applied to performance art. Finally, research on live programming is mostly motivated by making programming more accessible and easier to understand, evaluating their tool designs through empirical studies with users. In delineating the spectrum of work on liveness, we hope to make the individual communities more aware of the work of the others.

Thus, AMPK functions as a signaling hub, coordinating anabolic and catabolic pathways to balance nutrient supply with energy demand at both the cellular and whole-body levels. AMPK is activated by various metabolic stresses such as ischemia or hypoxia or glucose deprivation and has both acute and long-term effects on metabolic pathways and key cellular functions. In addition, AMPK appears to be a major sensor of energy demand in exercising muscle and acts both as a multitask gatekeeper and an energy regulator in skeletal muscle. Acute activation of AMPK has been shown to promote glucose transport and fatty acid oxidation while suppressing glycogen synthase activity and protein synthesis. Chronic activation of AMPK induces a shift in muscle fiber type composition, reduces markers of muscle degeneration and enhances muscle oxidative capacity potentially by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, recent evidence demonstrates that AMPK may not only regulate metabolism during exercise but also in the recovery phase. AMPK acts as a molecular transducer between exercise and insulin signaling and is necessary for the ability of prior contraction/exercise to increase muscle insulin sensitivity. Based on these observations, drugs that activate AMPK might be expected to be useful in the treatment of metabolic disorders and insulin resistance in various conditions."

Finally, the support of such a measure supported on a graph is a meager, very thin (hence sparse) set. Therefore the LP on measures with this sparsity inducing criterion can be interpreted as an analogue for infinite-dimensional signals of the LP in super-resolution for (sparse) atomic signals. In data science, it is often relevant to process moments of a signal instead of the signal itself. For complex valued signals, the moments are Fourier coefficients, and many filtering operations are efficiently carried out in the sequence of moments. In numerical approximation algorithms, many operations on real valued signals are more efficiently implemented in their sequence of Chebyshev coefficients [19]. In the moment-SOS hierarchy approach, many nonlinear nonconvex problems are reformulated and solved approximately in the sequence of moments; see [13, 12] and references therein. Once moments or approximate moments have been computed, one is faced with the inverse problem of reconstructing the signal from its moments. The recent work [15] describes an algorithm based on the Christoffel-Darboux kernel, to recover the graph of a function from knowledge of its moments. Its novelty (and distinguishing feature) is to approximate the graph of the function (rather than the function itself) with a semialgebraic function (namely a minimizer of a sum of squares of polynomials) with L 1 and pointwise convergence guarantees for an increasing number of input moments.

We test this hypothesis by developing a calibrated regression model to predict variations in high AGB values (mean \\textgreater{}300 Mg/ha) in French Guiana by a methodological approach for spatial extrapolation with data from the optical geoscience laser altimeter system (GLAS), forest inventories, radar, optics, and environmental variables for spatial inter-and extrapolation. Given their higher point count, GLAS data allow a wider coverage of AGB values. We find that the metrics from GLAS footprints are correlated with field AGB estimations (R 2 =0.54, RMSE=48.3 Mg/ha) with no bias for high values. First, predictive models, including remote-sensing, environmental variables and spatial correlation functions, allow us to obtain \"wall-to-wall\" AGB maps over French Guiana with an RMSE for the in situ AGB estimates of ~51 Mg/ha and R${}^2$=0.48 at a 1-km grid size. We conclude that a calibrated regression model based on GLAS with dependent environmental data can produce good AGB predictions even for high AGB values if the calibration data fit the AGB range. We also demonstrate that small temporal and spatial mismatches between field data and GLAS footprints are not a problem for regional and global calibrated regression models because field data aim to predict large and deep tendencies in AGB variations from environmental gradients and do not aim to represent high but stochastic and temporally limited variations from forest dynamics. Thus, we advocate including a greater variety of data, even if less precise and shifted, to better represent high AGB values in global models and to improve the fitting of these models for high values."

(Or when they exist, they just aren't nearly as difficult and awkward as what I encounter outdoors.)\n\nDo any of you have ideas for exercises that will help build *explosive* core power? Currently I do the RR about 3x/wk but do the bodyline drills daily. I think that training the front lever could help me a bit, but since it's not an explosive movement it can only help me so much. My only other idea so far is to do hanging leg lifts more explosively, but this will probably be pretty annoying b/c each set will require a lot of time to stop my momentum and reset. (Though on the other hand, maybe stopping my momentum will also mimic what you have to do on the rock once you've stuck the move?)

We can also derive complete thermodynamic and kinetic description of G-quadruplex folding pathways by measuring cation binding, one at a time. Getting quantitative information required accounting for nonspecific adduct formation and for the response factors of the different molecular forms. But with these caveats in mind, the approach is mature enough for routine biophysical characterization of nucleic acids. A second goal is to obtain more detailed structural information on each of the complexes separated by the mass spectrometer. One such approaches is ion mobility spectrometry, and even today the challenge lies in the structural interpretation of the measurements. We showed that, although structures such as G-quadruplexes are well-preserved in the MS conditions, double helices actually get more compact in the gas phase. These major rearrangements forced us to challenge comfortable assumptions. Further work is still needed to generalize how to deduce structures in solution from ion mobility spectrometry data, and in particular how to account for the electrospray charging mechanisms and for ion internal energy effects. These studies also called for complementary approaches to ion mobility. Recently, we applied isotope exchange labeling mass spectrometry to characterize nucleic acid structures for the first time, and we reported the first ever circular dichroism ion spectroscopy measurement on mass-selected trapped ions. Circular dichroism plays a key role in assigning the stacking topology, and our new method now opens the door to characterizing a wide variety of chiral molecule by mass spectrometry. In summary, advanced mass spectrometry approaches to characterize gas-phase structures work well for G-quadruplexes because they are stiffened by inner cations. The next objective will be to generalize these methodologies to a wider range of nucleic acid structures."

First, after an introduction to topological methods and their application in data analysis, a brief overview of TTK's main entry point for end users, namely ParaView, will be presented. Second, an overview of TTK's main features will be given. A running example will be described in detail, showcasing how to access TTK's features via ParaView, Python, VTK/C++, and C++. Third, hands-on sessions will concretely show how to use TTK in ParaView for multiple, representative data analysis tasks. Fourth, the usage of TTK will be presented for developers, in particular by describing several examples of visualization and data analysis projects that were built on top of TTK. Finally, some feedback regarding the usage of TTK as a teaching platform for topological analysis will be given. Presenters of this tutorial include experts in topological methods, core authors of TTK as well as active users, coming from academia, labs, or industry. A large part of the tutorial will be dedicated to hands-on exercises and a rich material package (including TTK pre-installs in virtual machines, code, data, demos, video tutorials, etc.) will be provided to the participants.

In the more exotic 3+1+Decay model, we find the tension reduced to $3.6\\sigma$. While a substantial improvement compared to the 3+1 model with the introduction of only one additional parameter, the tension is still too large to assuage concerns. The second analysis is the results of an expanded IceCube sterile neutrino search. A previous sterile neutrino search found no evidence for sterile neutrinos, finding a p-value of 8%. Of the three sterile mixing angles, $\\theta_{14}, \\theta_{24}$, and $\\theta_{34}$, only $\\theta_{24}$ was fitted for, as $\\theta_{14}$ was negligible and $\\theta_{34} = 0$ was considered a conservative assumption. We present results of an analysis where we include $\\theta_{34}$ to the fitted model. Both a frequentist and Bayesian analysis were conducted, with fits done in terms of the mass-squared splitting $\\Delta m_{41}^2$ and the mixing matrix parameters $|U_{\\mu4}|^2$ and $|U_{\\tau4}|^2$. The frequentist analysis finds a best fit at $\\Delta m_{41}^2 = 5.0\\ \\textrm{eV}^2$, $|U_{\\mu4}|^2 = 0.04$, and $|U_{\\tau4}|^2 = 0.006$, with a p-value of 5.2% assuming Wilks' Theorem with 3 degrees of freedom. Pseudoexperiments are indicating a smaller p-value 2.7%. The Bayesian analysis finds a similar best fit point at $\\Delta m_{41}^2 = 5.0\\ \\textrm{eV}^2$, $|U_{\\mu4}|^2 = 0.02$, and $|U_{\\tau4}|^2 = 0.006$, with a Bayes factor indicating a ``Very Strong'' preference for this sterile hypothesis over the null hypothesis."

Should I be feeling muscle activation in my core? It seems like I only feel it in my legs. I was feeling it in my lower back momentarily but I think I've corrected that. Anyone have tips?\nstickysweetastytreat: u/vaughannt\n\nYeah feeling it in your legs is fine, like along your butt &amp; backs of your thighs. For low back, there are two ways you can do it-- by moving your low back with it, or not. If you want to keep it out of your low back, then tuck your tailbone while you lift your legs solely with your butt + legs. Don't expect to lift your legs very high this way, but you do put more work on your butt/legs. Instead of thinking \"tuck your tailbone\", you could also think of it like trying to draw your navel up away from the floor while you lift your legs.\n\nIf your low back isn't irritated by it, there's no inherent harm in moving with your low back. You could even try both ways!\nvaughannt: Awesome, thank you for the reply!\nstickysweetastytreat: Yw, good luck!\n"

        "text": " relations between these two approaches have lead to some widely spread misconceptions. In particular, while the so-called Maximum A Posterori (MAP) estimate with a Gaussian noise model does lead to an optimization problem with a quadratic data-fidelity term, we disprove through explicit examples the common belief that the converse would be true. It has already been shown [7, 9] that for denoising in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, for any prior probability on the unknowns, MMSE estimation can be expressed as a penalized least squares problem, with the apparent characteristics of a MAP estimation problem with Gaussian noise and a (generally) different prior on the unknowns. In other words, the variational approach is rich enough to build all possible MMSE estimators associated to additive Gaussian noise via a well chosen penalty. We generalize these results beyond Gaussian denoising and characterize noise models for which the same phenomenon occurs. In particular, we prove that with (a variant of) Poisson noise and any prior probability on the unknowns, MMSE estimation can again be expressed as the solution of a penalized least squares optimization problem. For additive scalar denois-ing the phenomenon holds if and only if the noise distribution is log-concave. In particular, Laplacian denoising can (perhaps surprisingly) be expressed as the solution of a penalized least squares problem. In the multivariate case, the same phenomenon occurs when the noise model belongs to a particular subset of the exponential family. For multivariate additive denoising, the phenomenon holds if and only if the noise is white and Gaussian."

        "text": " that many real-world examples of social dilemmas are actually continuous in nature, we extend this previous work to more general dilemmas, in which agents operate in a continuous strategy space. The social dilemma under study here is the well-known Ultimatum Game, in which an optimal solution is achieved if agents agree on a common strategy. We investigate whether a scale-free interaction network facilitates agents to reach agreement, especially in the presence of fixed-strategy agents that represent a desired (e.g. human) outcome. Moreover, we study the influence of rewiring in the interaction network. The agents are equipped with continuous-action learning automata and play a large number of random pairwise games in order to establish a common strategy. From our experiments, we may conclude that results obtained in discrete-strategy games can be generalized to continuous-strategy games to a certain extent: a scale-free interaction network structure allows agents to achieve agreement on a common strategy, and rewiring in the interaction network greatly enhances the agents ability to reach agreement. However, it also becomes clear that some alternative mechanisms, such as reputation and volunteering, have many subtleties involved and do not have convincing beneficial effects in the continuous case."

The promise is that one reference state is the same as the unknown state and the task is to find out unambiguously which one it is. The particular choice of the reference states is unknown to us, and only the probability distribution describing this choice is known. In a general case when multiple copies of unknown and reference states are available I propose a scheme consisting of beamsplitters and photodetectors that is optimal within linear optics. UI can be considered as a search in a quantum database, whose elements are the reference states and the query is represented by the unknown state. This perspective motivated me to show that reference states can be recovered after the measurement and might be used (with reduced success rate) in subsequent UI. Moreover, I analyze the influence of noise in preparation of coherent states on the performance of the proposed setup. Another problem I address is the unambiguous comparison of a pair of unknown qudit unitary channels. I characterize all solutions and identify the optimal ones. I prove that in optimal experiments for comparison of unitary channels the entanglement is necessary. The last task I studied is the unambiguous comparison of unknown non-degenerate projective measurements. I distinguish between measurement devices with apriori labeled and unlabeled outcomes. In both cases only the difference of the measurements can be concluded unambiguously. For the labeled case I derive the optimal strategy if each unknown measurement is used only once. However, if the apparatuses are not labeled, then each measurement device must be used (at least) twice. In particular, for qubit measurement apparatuses with unlabeled outcomes I derive the optimal test state in the two-shots scenario."

The restored songs included \"Captain Hook Soliloquy\" and \"Dream With Me\", as well as other sung material, dance music and orchestral interludes. The world premiere recording of Bernstein's complete score was released on CD in 2005, conducted by Alexander Frey, and featuring Broadway star Linda Eder in the role of Wendy Darling, and acclaimed baritone Daniel Narducci as Captain Hook, on the Koch International Classics label.\nIn December 2006, it was produced for the stage by The King's Head Theatre in Islington, London, with Katherine Kastin as Peter Pan, Peter Land as Captain Hook, and Rafaella Hutchinson as Tinker Bell, directed by Stephanie Sinclaire and featuring new musical arrangements by Mike Dixon. This production used only parts of the Bernstein score and none of the original orchestrations. The music was performed by an instrumental trio.\nIn September 2008 the world premiere performance of the full Bernstein score was performed in concert with Alexander Frey conducting the Gulbenkian Orchestra, with dialogue adapted from the original J. M. Barrie play by Nina Bernstein Simmons. Three performances were given in Cascais, Portugal, for a combined audience of over 10,000 people, and featured Geraldine James (narrator), John Sackville-West (Peter Pan), Charlotte Ellett and Rachel Nicholls (Wendy) and Nicholas Lester (Captain Hook).\nThe first stage production of the full Bernstein score was given by Santa Barbara Theater (California) in December 2008, directed by Albert Ihde with a full orchestra again conducted by Alexander Frey.\nAnother production was held at the Richard B.

We also take into account the interconnected spatial structure of the involved brain areas, by incorporating the above neurobiological mechanisms in a coupled neural field framework, where each area is represented by a separate neural field with intra- and inter-area connections. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply neural fields to this process. Using numerical simulations and mathematical analysis, we explore the short-term and long-term dynamics of the model upon alternance of phases of hippocampal replay and retrieval cue of an external input. This external input is encodable as a memory pattern in the form of a multiple bump attractor pattern in the individual neural fields. In the model, hippocampal memory patterns become encoded first, before neocortical ones, because of the smaller distances between the bumps of the hippocampal memory patterns. As a result, retrieval of the input pattern in the neocortex at short time-scales necessitates the additional input delivered by the memory pattern of the hippocampus. Neocortical memory patterns progressively consolidate at longer times, up to a point where their retrieval does not need the support of the hippocampus anymore. At longer times, perturbation of the hippocampal neural fields by neurogenesis erases the hippocampus pattern, leading to a final state where the memory pattern is exclusively evoked in the neocortex. Therefore, the dynamics of our model successfully reproduces the main features of the standard consolidation theory. This suggests that neurogenesis in the hippocampus and distance-dependent synaptic plasticity coupled to synaptic depression and spike frequency adaptation, are indeed critical neurobiological processes in memory consolidation."

For the differential reaction rate, the definition of the momentum dependent chromoelectric gluon distribution function involves staple-shaped Wilson lines. For the inclusive reaction rate, the Wilson lines collapse into a straight line along the real time axis and the distribution becomes momentum independent. The relation between the two Wilson lines is analogous to the relation between the Wilson lines appearing in the gluon parton distribution function (PDF) and the gluon transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF). The centrality dependence of the quarkonium nuclear modification factor measured by experiments probes the momentum independent distribution while the transverse momentum dependence and measurements of the azimuthal angular anisotropy may be able to probe the momentum dependent one. We discuss one way to indirectly constrain the quarkonium in-medium real potential by using the factorization formula and lattice calculations. The leading quantum correction to the semiclassical transport equation of quarkonium is also worked out. The study can be easily generalized to quarkonium transport in cold nuclear matter, which is relevant for quarkonium production in eA collisions in the future Electron-Ion Collider."

This scenario though looks very appealing is still far from being well established. One of the main differences between standard spin systems to molecular systems is the absence of quenched disorder and the presence of translational invariance: it often assumed that this difference is not relevant, but this conjecture is still far from being established. The quantities, which are well defined and characterized for spin models, are not easily calculable for molecular glasses due to the lack of quenched disorder which breaks the translational invariance in the system and the characterization of the similarity between the spin and the structural glass transition remained an elusive subject still now. In this study we introduced a model structural glass with built in quenched disorder which alleviates this main difference between the spin and molecular glasses thereby helping us to compare these two systems: the possibility of producing a good thermalization at rather low temperatures is one of the advantages of this model."

As a consequence the amplitude of the decay of $h_{22}(r)$ is enormously greater than that of $h_{11}(r)$. The effective solute-solute attraction then remains discernible at distances at which the solvent molecules are essentially no longer correlated, as found in similar circumstances in an earlier model. The second osmotic virial coefficient is large and negative, as expected. We find that the solvent-mediated part $W(r)$ of the potential of mean force between solutes, evaluated at contact, $r=1$, is related in this model to the Gibbs free energy of solvation at fixed pressure, $\\Delta G_p^*$, by $(Z/2) W(1) + \\Delta G_p^* \\equiv p v_0$, where $Z$ is the coordination number of the lattice, $p$ the pressure, and $v_0$ the volume of the cell associated with each lattice site. A large, positive $\\Delta G_p^*$ associated with the low solubility is thus reflected in a strong attraction (large negative $W$ at contact), which is the major contributor to the second osmotic virial coefficient. In this model, the low solubility (large positive $\\Delta G_p^*$) is due partly to an unfavorable enthalpy of solvation and partly to an unfavorable solvation entropy, unlike in the hydrophobic effect, where the enthalpy of solvation itself favors high solubility, but is overweighed by the unfavorable solvation entropy."

Poor treatment of them while they are alive is.\n\nHow universally do you apply this principle?\n\nConsider a hypothetical human society where a number of kids are raised under the best possible conditions.  All of them are happy and satisfied, until they are killed painlessly and without warning at the age of 15.  Is this ethical?  If not, what makes this scenario different?\n[deleted]: Depends on your definition of 'ethics'. I argue that it wouldn't be unethical to kill 'isolately'. To kill any living being is 'fine' as long as their death does not inflict suffering on other living beings. For example, to kill a calf would be 'wrong' because their mother would suffer by cause of their death.\n\nHowever, if said calf existed in isolation and their death did not cause emotional or physical harm on others \u2013 and the procedure was to be done painlessly \u2013 I can see no problem with their murder. It does not matter if it is an individual of our species or another's.\nTinac4: I personally disagree--I'm more of a preference utilitarian than a classical utilitarian--but I see where you're coming from.  It does seem to me that your position leads to some unintuitive results, though.  For instance, if you came across a sleeping homeless man, you had a method to kill him painlessly and take his money, and you knew with certainty that nobody would care about or notice his death, would it be ethical to kill him?  (Obviously, this involves a lot of simplifications that don't apply in real life.)\n[deleted]: &gt; would it be ethical to kill him?\n\nI suppose we're having a mature discussion here so I'm going to answer honestly. Simply put, yes. But then again, that's according to MY definition of 'ethics' as I stated in the earlier comment.\n\nAs long as the procedure is done in a peaceful and painless manner, I really can't see how that would be a bad thing. It may help if I clarify that I'm an atheist who doesn't believe in afterlife, so to me death isn't anything gruesome.\nTinac4: Fair enough!  I think that the scenario you described would be bad, but only on the basis of my own ethical intuitions, and those intuitions definitely aren't universal.\n"

Methods: The estimator performance is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation with an idealized model of a photon counting detector that includes only pileup and quantum noise. Transmitted x-ray spectra are computed for a calibration phantom. The transmitted spectra are used to compute random data for photon counting detectors with pileup. Detectors with small and large dead times are considered. Neural network training data with extremely low noise are computed by averaging the random detected data with pileup for a large numbers of exposures of the phantom. Each exposure is equivalent to a projection image or one projection of a computed tomography scan. Training data with high noise are computed by using data from one exposure. Finally, training data are computed by adding random data to the low noise data. The added random data are multivariate normal with zero mean and covariance equal to the sample covariance of data for an object with properly chosen attenuation. To test the estimators, random data are computed for different thicknesses of three test objects with different compositions. These are used as inputs to the neural network estimators. The mean squared errors (MSE), variance and square of the bias of the neural networks' outputs with the random object data are each compared to the CRLB. Results: The MSE for a network trained with low noise data and added noise is close to the CRLB for both the low and high pileup cases. Networks trained with very low noise data have low bias but large variance for both pileup cases. ralvarez@aprendtech.com Networks trained with high noise data have both large bias and large variance. Conclusion: With a properly chosen level of added training data noise, a neural network estimator for photon counting data with pileup can have variance close to the CRLB with negligible bias."

This key tool becomes particularly simple and insightful at finite temperature, where only short classical trajectories need to be kept in the expansion. In addition to the general theory for integrable systems, we analyze in detail a few typical examples of experimental relevance: circles, rings and square billiards. In the latter, extensive numerical calculations are used as a check for the success of the semiclassical analysis. We study the weak-field regime where classical trajectories remain essentially unaffected, the intermediate field regime where we identify new oscillations characteristic for ballistic mesoscopic structures, and the high-field regime where the typical de Haas-van Alphen oscillations exhibit finite-size corrections.

Monitoring the treatment delivery online provides the option to reschedule beams dynamically in order to avoid pausing and hence to reduce treatment time. While human breathing patterns are complex and may change rapidly, we need a model which can be verified quickly and use approximation by a superposition of sine curves. Further, we simplify the 3D breathing motion into separate 1D models. We compensate the simplification by adding noise inside the model itself. In turn, we synchronize between the multiple models representing the different spatial directions, the treatment simulation, and corresponding verification queries. Our preliminary results show a 16.02 % to 37.21 % mean improvement on the idle time compared to a static beam schedule, depending on an additional safety margin. Note that an additional safety margin around the ultrasound robot can decrease idle times but also compromises plan quality by limiting the range of available beam directions. In contrast, the approach using online model checking maintains the plan quality.

There are any number of people whom one might call probability enthusiasts who feel that probability provides all the answers by itself, with no need of help from logic. Cheeseman [1], Henrion [5] and others think it useful to look at a distribution of probabilities over a whole algebra of statements, to update that distribution in the light of new evidence, and to use the latest updated distribution of probability over the algebra as a basis for planning and decision making. A slightly weaker form of this approach is captured by Nilsson [15], where one assumes certain probabilities for certain statements, and infers the probabilities, or constraints on the probabilities of other statement. None of this corresponds to what I call probabilistic inference. All of the inference that is taking place, either in Bayesian updating, or in probabilistic logic, is strictly deductive. Deductive inference, particularly that concerned with the distribution of classical probabilities or chances, is of great importance. But this is not to say that there is no important role for what earlier logicians have called \"ampliative\" or \"inductive\" or \"scientific\" inference, in which the conclusion goes beyond the premises, asserts more than do the premises. This depends on what David Israel [6] has called \"real rules of inference\".

As a result, developers need means to study the runtime behavior of streams in the goal of both mitigating such abstraction overheads and optimizing stream processing. Unfortunately, there is a lack of dedicated tools able to dynamically analyze streams to help developers specifically locate issues degrading application performance. In this paper, we address the profiling and optimization of streams. We present a novel profiling technique for measuring the computations performed by a stream in terms of elapsed reference cycles, which we use to locate problematic streams with a major impact on application performance. While accuracy is crucial to this end, the inserted instrumentation code causes the execution of extra cycles, which are partially included in the profiles. To mitigate this issue, we estimate and compensate for the extra cycles caused by the inserted instrumentation code. We implement our approach in StreamProf that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first dedicated stream profiler for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). With StreamProf, we find that cycle profiling is effective to detect problematic streams whose optimization can enable significant performance gains. We also find that the accurate profiling of tasks supporting parallel stream processing allows the diagnosis of load imbalance according to the distribution of stream-related cycles at a thread level. We conduct an evaluation on sequential and parallel stream-based workloads that are publicly available in three different sources. The evaluation shows that our profiling technique is efficient and yields accurate profiles. Moreover, we show the actionability of our profiles by guiding stream-related optimizations on two workloads from Renaissance. Our optimizations require the modification of only a few lines of code while achieving speedups up to a factor of 5x. Java streams have been extensively studied by recent work, focusing on both how developers are using streams and how to optimize them. Current approaches in the optimization of streams mainly rely on static analysis techniques that overlook runtime information, suffer from important limitations to detect all streams executed by a Java application, or are not suitable for the analysis of parallel streams. Understanding the dynamic behavior of both sequential and parallel stream processing and its impact on application performance is crucial to help users make better decisions while using streams."

Health officials have said that panic-buying of the masks by people who do not need them can exacerbate the shortage, forcing health care workers to reuse or improvise protective equipment, often with greater risk.\n\n&gt;Anderson Warlick, the president and CEO of Parkdale, worked closely with White House officials to expedite the process through \u201cbureaucratic red tape,\u201d the NCTO said, allowing production to begin soon after the masks were approved and certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n&gt;Production is expected to begin on Monday, the NCTO said, with deliveries starting in the middle of the week. Once at full capacity (in about four to five weeks) the coalition expects to produce up to 10 million face masks per week.\nClay_Statue: *Well I'll be damned...* the fucking free-market actually working towards the common good for one hot second.\nDmination: Obviously it's a great initiative. But there not doing it for free (I'm not expecting them to do that) it's great PR and the demand for what they regularly produce will drop.

Starting easy without forcing yourself too much. Then doing dynamics and continuing the stretching. \n\nWhat's the reason to NOT warm up with active &amp; dynamic stretches?\nbrawnkowsky: You are right.  The person above probably thought you were referring to passive stretching (ex: touching your toes and holding for a few seconds).  Active stretching should proceed all workouts if you intend on keeping it safe.  Active stretching includes jumping jacks, lunges without weight, straight leg marches, skips, etc.  It should not be strenuous or difficult, but it should get your heart rate going, get blood flowing through your muscles, and increase body temperature.\n\nAnother good way to remove muscle soreness is through something called myofascial release.  It is essentially a massage of your muscles; you can do it by using a foam roll or a PVC Pipe and rolling it down your muscles.  What it does is separate the muscle fibers in your muscles back to their normal differences.  After a workout, the fascia (outer coating) of the fibers can mesh together, inhibiting sliding filaments, which helps cause soreness.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam_rolling\n\nAnd finally, you can do a lactic acid drain.  After a good lower body workout or run, lay on the grown with your legs straight.  Put your feet about 4-6 inches above the ground (ex. Pushing against the wall) and lay there for 5-ish minutes.  Drains the lactic acid from your muscles, feels real good.  \n\nIf you still feel very sore after all workouts and all of these techniques, lower the volume of your workout for a week or two (download).  Do the same workouts with the same intensity, but do half of the sets/reps.\n\nGood luck\nalexispres: I thought the lactic acid build up was disproven?\nbrawnkowsky: I haven't heard this, source?\nalexispres: \"Lactic Acid is commonly thought to induce muscle failure or soreness, but has not been shown to be the causative factor. It is highly correlated though[2], as lactic acid is produced when the muscle is sore; however its more of a fuel source than a soreness causing agent.[3][4][5]\"\n\nsource: http://examine.com/faq/why-do-my-muscles-get-sore.html\n\nI guess it's not necessarily disproved, my bad there. But according to examine.com there is no evidence it causes soreness. It still occurs though. :)\nbrawnkowsky: You're right, lactic acid doesn't cause soreness.  I am pretty sure it causes your muscles to feel \"heavy\" (no scientific basis btw).  The lactic acid drain just feels really good lol\nalexispres: No arguing there :)\n"

I feel like as the media keeps raising the bar for what you should look like, act like, think like, and believe, it is very hard to appreciate who you are as a person. So to those of you who are older and wiser than me, how do I grow up happy in this cult of self expression we live in?\ncchap22: My wife and I have been discussing this since seeing your beautifully worded question. \n\nI have 2 answers. The first one stems from a discussion from a dying mother on her death bed. She explained that looking back in your life you aren't going to care about how you looked on your date in junior year of high school, how good your hair looked in 10th grade  or the days binging your favorite shows. You remember the loved ones around you, the life that created you, and the life you create. Family and people will bring you moments of true and utter bliss... happiness\n\nAnswer #2 Only with true sorrow can you achieve true happiness. You have to live the dark to feel the light. You are going, 14 years old, my guess is you have never hit rock bottom, you have never wanted to die more than live, and as such you have never been lifted out of this. Right now most everything in your life is plastic, fake and skin deep. I know this sounds kind of brutal but it's true. You haven't had to slave your fingers to the bone to ensure you're child has food on there plate,  so you haven't experienced the warm feeling of watching them eat knowing you provided that life. \n\nA good example of this was when I was about 22 years old. My gf and me at the time were being evicted, she just lost her job and her car was totalled. We were facing the prospect of living homeless and had not eaten in almost 2 whole days. It was pure misery. My parents ended up letting us move in until we saved enough to be back on our feet. Waking up that next morning in a clean bed, central heating, breakfast on the skillet, and Sunday morning cartoons... that is true happiness. It washes over you like a warmth and you never forget\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X-7558NYtwY\nscottd3363: It makes me smile to know that my question was enough to spark a discussion between you and your wife. Thank you so much for the advice and I\u2019ll be sure to remember this reply.\ncchap22: :) you are very welcome. Thank you for starting this discussion, you have stumbled upon one of the deepest questions in life often stepped around and it is refreshing to really ponder. In short your happiness will come in time I'm sure of it. It's just gonna start with some of the lowest points in your life. Make sure you embrace them \n"

If you had said \u201cAre you sure, because every Toyota I\u2019ve ever owned had it?\u201d it still would have had been improper use of the question mark.

In the context that you used the question mark, it suggests confusion on your part as opposed to asking a question (eg - \u201cEvery one I\u2019ve owned has had it?\u201d - confusion as to whether or not every one you have owned did have it). \n\nHopefully that clears it up a bit for you. \nUkmkiv: I understood your point from the first time you made it... my counter argument was that of using colloquial language on internet forums as to be honest there's no reason for use of propper sentence structure... there is also the chance that people who have upvoted agree with the point being made that all Toyotas have either the arrow or the pipe is there not? That leaves one other person saying that it isn't a question and yourself. \nMoreIsLessIsMore: You just kind of argued against your own point... Your comment here was very hard to follow because of *(you guessed it)* the lack of sentence structure and proper usage of the English language. The purpose of sentence structure is to make ideas more-easily read and understood. When you just jam your thoughts into one big, run-on sentence it is very hard to follow and understand and, as an extension, respond to. \n\nAs well, I believe you\u2019re missing the point about the upvotes. I was saying that the person saying \u201cWhy is there a question mark?\u201d is not alone in their thinking. \nUkmkiv: Apologies for my grammar not being upto scratch. From now on I will ensure that every comment I write on reddit is upto our resident English language assessors standard. If you would like to look back to the comment \"why is there a question mark?\" there are 2 upvotes, one will be the commenter and two I'm assuming will be yourself. \n"

The first embedding scheme is based on decomposition of a number (pixel-value) in sum of prime numbers, while the second one is based on decomposition in sum of natural numbers. Each of these particular representations generates a different set of (virtual) bit-planes altogether, suitable for embedding purposes. They not only allow one to embed secret message in higher bit-planes but also do it without much distortion, with a much better stego-image quality, in a reliable and secured manner, guaranteeing efficient retrieval of secret message. A comparative performance study between the classical Least Significant Bit (LSB) method, the data hiding technique using Fibonacci -p-Sequence decomposition and our proposed schemes has been done. Theoretical analysis indicates that image quality of the stego-image hidden by the technique using Fibonacci decomposition improves against simple LSB substitution method, while the same using the prime decomposition method improves drastically against that using Fibonacci decomposition technique, and finally the natural number decomposition method is a further improvement against that using prime decomposition technique. Also, optimality for the last technique is proved. For both of our data-hiding techniques, the experimental results show that, the stego-image is visually indistinguishable from the original cover image."

Sthread leverages the open-source SimGrid libraries, and will eventually be integrated into SimGrid. Sthread employs a non-preemptive model in which thread context switches occur only at multithreaded system calls (e.g., mutex, semaphore) or before accesses to shared memory regions. The emphasis is on finding \"algorithmic bugs\" (bugs in an original algorithm, implemented as POSIX threads and shared memory regions.

This article introduces and analyzes the most important algorithmic novelties that were necessary to tackle the new layers of expressiveness in the benchmark problems and to achieve a high level of performance. The extensions include critical path analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal parallel plans. The linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses known NP hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect to the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations. The efficiency of this algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance: for each encountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is scheduled. One major strength of MIPS is its static analysis phase that grounds and simplifies parameterized predicates, functions and operators, that infers knowledge to minimize the state description length, and that detects domain object symmetries. The latter aspect is analyzed in detail. MIPS has been developed to serve as a complete and optimal state space planner, with admissible estimates, exploration engines and branching cuts. In the competition version, however, certain performance compromises had to be made, including floating point arithmetic, weighted heuristic search exploration according to an inadmissible estimate and parameterized optimization."

Either someone gives them to me or I manage to fix what I've got, else I've got nothing to work with.  :/\n\nIf I pry the grill off without damaging it, would normal superglue be good enough to put them back on so they don't look like crap?\njonvon65: Ahh, I see. The issue isn't getting the speakers open as much as fixing the blown drivers themselves. I haven't heard many success stories of blown drivers being restored. The only spare speakers I have are little mid rangers from my car (one of them pops when turned too loud but otherwise works fine). I would send them to you but they're 2.75 inches in diameter which is a lot smaller than the ones you have. Normal superglue probably wouldn't adhere that well to the front grills because it's a little too thin. Thicker glue like hot glue or gorilla glue would be better for this situation.\n2LateImDead: I might be able to get some Gorilla glue if it's even fixable.  Probably isn't though, like you said.  Thanks for the offer of those speakers from your car.  I'm pretty sure they're actually about the size of these ones - I shone a light through the mesh to look inside and these things are like 90% casing, the speaker inside is fairly small.  I don't have any exact measurements, though.\n\nDo you have an estimate of how much it'd cost to mail them?  I live in Virginia.  I don't really have any money because my job sucks and I'm going through college and supporting myself, but I could skip paying my phone bill this month to cover shipping costs, potentially.  But I can't imagine they'd be huge, even shipping from Asia is normally no more than $10, if it's something reasonably small.\njonvon65: Honestly, don't worry about the shipping, I've got you covered. I'm testing them out right now and they're not half bad. Also they're just bare speakers and I'd like to put them in an enclosure of some sort before I ship them. What would you be hooking them up to?\n2LateImDead: I've got an old Sony amplifier that uses the basic black and red speaker wires to hook things up.  It's also got RCA (yellow-white-red, minus the yellow since it's just audio) outputs and inputs.  I've got an AUX-RCA adapter to input sound.  I've never used the RCA outputs but I'm under the impression that they'd work the same, so whatever is easiest for you.\n\nThanks a bunch, by the way.  I've been really stressed about not having any speakers.  I'll still need to find more, but getting back 2 when I lost 4 cuts the loss in half, which is a big help.  And even 2 is enough to get back to practicing and recording.  :)\n\nI'll send you a PM with my address.\njonvon65: Ahh ok, good, that makes it easy then! Of course, just letting you know beforehand that these speakers are good quality but they are rather small, you won't be pissing off the neighbors with them. That being said, just don't turn them up too loud and you should be fine. I'll start on building the enclosures tomorrow and hopefully I can get them shipped out to you sometime this week. You're welcome!\n"

Sounds pretty reasonable. We \"seasoned\" the bricks by doing this - everyday for 5 days we made a bigger and hotter fire. Starting out with a very small 200 degree fire and ending with the 800 degree fire.\neldorel: If you're planning on consistently going into the 800 degree range then you are going to start having problems pretty quickly.  \n\nAre you planning on cooking 20+ inch pizzas, are you working on loaves of bread, or are you planning to cook multiple items with only one firing? \n\nThe oven my brother used for demonstrations was about the size of your oven, and and hour fired to 650 was usually enough to do an entire flat ( 9 loaves ) and a large pizza after the demo.\n\nEven if you gently condition the oven every time the humidity gets above 60%, at 800 degrees that mortar will probably start breaking down just from the heat after a few months.  \n\nAfter looking at the photos again, do you have a door for that oven, or are you leaving it open?\nkevin530: Leaving it open\neldorel: You should make a door for it.\nIt helps the oven to heat up faster, and lets you use a smaller fire to get the oven to temp. It also helps keep the oven at the right temperature for much longer. \n\nYou can see an example of one we made on top of the oven in [this](http://i.imgur.com/FMg3t41.jpg) photo.\n\nThat one is a handle attached to two layers of wood with a layer of leather cover in a canvas pad. \nThe entire door gets dipped in water every time before being wedged into the opening, and it has a 1/2 inch opening for draft above the door.  \n\nWe have a hinged metal and wood door on his normal oven.

FU Tau A is significantly overluminous relative to an isochrone passing through FU Tau B and relative to other members of Taurus near its spectral type, which may indicate that it is an unresolved binary. FU Tau A and B are likely to be components of a binary system based on the low probability (~3x10^-4) that Taurus would produce two unrelated brown dwarfs with a projected separation of a </- 6\". Barnard 215 contains only one other young star and is in a remote area of Taurus, making FU Tau A and B the first spectroscopically-confirmed brown dwarfs discovered forming in isolation rather than in a stellar cluster or aggregate. Because they were born in isolation and comprise a weakly bound binary, dynamical interactions with stars could not have played a role in their formation, and thus are not essential for the birth of brown dwarfs. ERRATUM: The K-band magnitude for FU Tau B in Table 1 is incorrect and should be 13.33. The bolometric luminosity of FU Tau B in Table 3 and Figure 5 is incorrect because of that mistake and a separate arithmetic error. The correct value of the luminosity is 0.0039 Lsun. FU Tau A and B exhibited different isochronal ages in the original Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in Figure 5, which was unexpected for members of a binary system. This discrepancy is reduced in the corrected version of Figure 5 since both objects are now above the isochrone for 1 Myr. Given the large uncertainties in model isochrones at such young ages, the positions of FU Tau A and B in Figure 5 could be roughly consistent with coevality."

And in lots of areas there is low cost help, including fixing cats as low as $20 each. \n\nOP, I hope your dog recovers and has a long cancer free life.\nK_J_W: You are so right. Our male dog was aggressive and would run. We were told if you neuter him.. he will stop. It did not. As he ages, he is getting better with being aggressive/reactive and running. He still does stuff that is frustrating out of a game for him. But the neutering wasn't the solve all. \nOur female has sensory issues. If she would have puppies it would have killed her. Mentally and physically.\nWowSeriously666: I feel for you OP and have had similar struggles. I had an adopted beagle as a child that was neutered after he was fully grown and it did nothing to stop him from jumping the fence and running the neighborhood trying to fight every dog in it. I remember I was always on my bike trying to hunt him down. At least we knew he couldn't make any little baby beagles. \n\nMy vet now has always advocated spaying and neutering pets. I ended up adopting my brothers large yellow Lab when he moved to Florida. He was never one to neuter his dogs because apparently neutering a male dog is just too personal for some guys. At least that's what he always said. When the dog was about seven years old he started having health issues. Turned out he was having prostate problems. I was told the first step would be to neuter him which would take care of the testosterone which would hopefully solve the prostate problems, if not more surgery would be needed. Thankfully neutering him solved his prostate issues. \n\nOnce a male dog has gone through puberty and had testosterone surging through his system neutering them really does very little to nothing to change their personality. The same for male cats, once they have the testosterone in their system you can't magically change their personality back to cute kitten-hood by neutering them. that's why they always tell you if you want to prevent spraying you must neuter them early.\nsamking86: I had my dog neutered at around 6 months hoping it would keep him from running off and looking for females. \n\nIt didn't work.\nAromatic-Box-592: Neutering isn\u2019t a magical fix all, neutered male dogs still think intact females smell *really* good (lol) but with training you should be able to stop him!\nsamking86: He has proven me wrong time and time again so now he gets put on his chain unless we are out there with him. We live in the country so a fence isn't an option and it's chickens he's after not females.\n"

A maximum snow depth of 76 cm (30 in) was recorded on 1 December in the Peak District, Sheffield, Doncaster, the Cotswold Hills and the Forest of Dean. In this event Scotland and Northern England were most severely affected. On 9 December temperatures recovered across much of the UK, causing a partial thaw.\nLater, on Thursday 16 December a cold front reintroduced a cold, arctic airstream. This cold spell brought further snow and ice chaos back to Ireland and Britain with Southern England, Wales, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland bearing the brunt of the wintry conditions. This led to severe disruption to the road and rail network with several airports being closed including London Heathrow Airport for a time. Several local temperature records were broken including a new record low for Northern Ireland of \u221218.7 \u00b0C (\u22121.7 \u00b0F) recorded at Castlederg on 23 December 2010.\nBy the new year a thaw had begun, and there was no recurrence of the extreme conditions for the remainder of the winter. There was some snowfall in early January, and there was an anticyclonic spell at the end of the month that brought some cold, frosty days. February was above average in temperature and ended on a mild note, although the snow returned in much of Scotland during March."

But since this is lab grown its more of a concern as to what they put in it.\n\nNote: Im heavily optimistic about new alternatives. The idea of lab grown meat isn't whats making me skeptical. Im just concerned it will make new problems along with it\nPeteWenzel: I don\u2019t think there is an ethical argument against abandoning the keeping of farm animals. Most of these animals\u2019 life is pure torture. The conditions are much worse than any being capable of feeling physical and mental pain/distress should ever have to endure.\n\nFurthermore they are not wild animals. We have bred them according to our own interest in such a way that they are grotesquely deformed and not part of the natural biosphere or food chain, anymore.\n\nBut I\u2019m sure we will keep some in zoos or even in farms for those who want to continue eating \u201cnatural\u201d meat.\n\n\nFarmers would have to grow fruits, vegetables, bio fuel, etc.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think the government would allow contaminated meat to be sold. Furthermore the media and consumers will be very cautious about this new meat and companies couldn\u2019t risk any scandals because the public relations damage would mean that consumers lost trust and stuck with the traditional alternative for a while longer.\n\n\n\nGordonMongolian: What confuses me about the first statement is that we have been owning animals as either pets or for slaughter for a really long time. Im not arguing about the big time companies as I am with many people on that subject that its wrong. But raising them fully and killing them letting experience life is fine to me.\nPeteWenzel: Animal abuse has always been part of the keeping of farm animals: Separation of mother and child, mutilation, premature slaughter, etc.\n\nEven if all farm animals had wonderful lifestyles today, not having them around wouldn\u2019t make a moral difference. No one is suffering because he/she was never born.\n\nAlso, you forgot impact on the planet. The carbon footprint of traditional meat production is huge.\nGordonMongolian: The problem has always been there which is true. But farmers tend to keep the younglings to grow their cattle hoard. As for the bigger industries they tend to do this tactic a lot more considering the huge population of cows already present. \n"

But I wouldn't say you have a responsibility to do that. If that's how you want to live your life then that's great, if you don't then that's fine too.\n\nI think the ethical foundation underlying the first premise is that one has an individual responsibility to take the actions that maximize the collective good or well being. And maybe that would be the way to go if we were talking about the ethical responsibilities of some kind of omniscient, omnipotent being, but we're talking about people. People are messy, ignorant, and selfish, and that ethical framework would fall apart instantly if you tried to apply it to the real world.\n\nA better middle ground in my opinion is to focus on collective action. If you have an idea for how people working together can improve the collective good, then work with those people you can convince to work with you to accomplish it. But if people aren't on board that doesn't mean they are being unethical, consider that maybe you simply haven't done a good enough job convincing them to see your way, or you haven't properly addressed their concerns. The burden of changing the world falls upon the shoulders of those who want to change it, not everyone else.\nbyrd_nick: You can replace the first premise with a more deontological one and the argument still works, as pointed out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/m7r04g/we_have_newfound_responsibility_to_do_more_to/grd6wkz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3).\n"

This point of view has several advantages. First, it allows one to model general constrained shape analysis problems, which opens new issues in this field. Second, using an extension of the Pontryagin maximum principle, one can characterize the optimal solutions of the shape deformation problem in a very general way as the solutions of constrained geodesic equations. Finally, recasting general algorithms of optimal control into shape analysis yields new efficient numerical methods in shape deformation analysis. Overall, the optimal control point of view unifies and generalizes different theoretical and numerical approaches to shape deformation problems, and also allows us to design new approaches. The optimal control problems that result from this construction are infinite dimensional and involve some constraints, and thus are nonstandard. In this article we also provide a rigorous and complete analysis of the infinite-dimensional shape space problem with constraints and of its finite-dimensional approximations."

We offer the intuition behind the results on this model, rigorously proved in Blaszczyszyn & Gaurav(2013), and illustrate them here by taking examples of random networks having prototypical degree distributions - Poisson degree distribution, which is commonly used as a kind of benchmark, and Power Law degree distribution, which is normally used to approximate the real-world networks. On these networks, the members are assumed to have varying attitudes towards propagating the information. We analyze three cases, in particular - (1) Bernoulli transmissions, when a member influences each of its friend with probability p; (2) Node percolation, when a member influences all its friends with probability p and none with probability 1-p; (3) Coupon-collector transmissions, when a member randomly selects one of his friends K times with replacement. We assume that the configuration model is the closest approximation of a large online social network, when the information available about the network is very limited. The key insight offered by this study from a firm's perspective is regarding how to evaluate the effectiveness of a marketing campaign and do cost-benefit analysis by collecting relevant statistical data from the pioneers it selects. The campaign evaluation criterion is informed by the observation that if the parameters of the underlying network and the campaign effectiveness are such that the campaign can indeed reach a significant fraction of the population, then the set of good pioneers also forms a significant fraction of the population. Therefore, in such a case, the firms can even adopt the naive strategy of repeatedly picking and targeting some number of pioneers at random from the population. With this strategy, the probability of them picking a good pioneer will increase geometrically fast with the number of tries."

Based on co-eluting mass/charge fragments, we developed an innovative data analysis method to reliably reconstruct the chemical formulae of the fragments, using efficient combinatorics and graph theory. The method does not require the presence of the molecular ion, which is absent in ~40% of EI spectra. Our method has been trained and validated on \\textgreater50 halocarbons and hydrocarbons, with 3 to 20 atoms and molar masses of 30 to 330 g mol-1, measured with a mass resolution of approx.~3500. For 90% of the compounds, more than 90% of the annotated fragment formulae are correct. Cases of wrong identification can be attributed to the scarcity of detected fragments per compound or the lack of isotopic constraint (no minor isotopocule detected).Our method enables to reconstruct most probable chemical formulae independently from spectral databases. Therefore, it demonstrates the suitability of EI-HRMS data for non-target analysis and paves the way for the identification of substances for which no EI mass spectrum is registered in databases. We illustrate the performances of our method for atmospheric trace gases and suggest that it may be well suited for many other types of samples.

        "text": " theory uses the maximum and minimum functions to combine uncertainties, whereas probability theory uses the plus and times operations. This leads to very dissimilar theories in terms of analytical framework, even though they share several semantic concepts. One of the shared concepts consists of expressing quantitatively the uncertainty associated with a given distribution. In probability theory its value corresponds to the gain of information that would result from conducting an experiment and ascertaining an actual result. This gain of information can equally well be viewed as a decrease in uncertainty about the outcome of an experiment. In this case the standard measure of information, and thus uncertainty, is Shannon entropy [AD75, G77]. It enjoys several advantages-it is characterized uniquely by a few, very natural properties, and it can be conveniently used in decision processes. This application is based on the principle of maximum entropy; it has become a popular method of relating decisions to uncertainty. This paper demonstrates that an equally integrated theory can be built on the foundation of possibility theory. We first show how to define measures of in formation and uncertainty for possibility assignments. Next we construct an information-based metric on the space of all possibility distributions defined on a given domain. It allows us to capture the notion of proximity in information content among the distributions. Lastly, we show that all the above constructions can be carried out for continuous distributions-possibility assignments on arbitrary measurable domains. We consider this step very significant-finite domains of discourse are but approximations of the real-life infinite domains. If possibility theory is to represent real world situations, it must handle continuous distributions both directly and through finite approximations. In the last section we discuss a principle of maximum uncertainty for possibility distributions. We show how such a principle could be formalized as an inference rule. We also suggest it could be derived as a consequence of simple assumptions about combining information. We would like to mention that possibility assignments can be viewed as fuzzy sets and that every fuzzy set gives rise to an assignment of possibilities. This correspondence has far reaching consequences in logic and in control theory. Our treatment here is independent of any special interpretation; in particular we speak of possibility distributions and possibility measures, defining them as measurable mappings into the interval [0, 1]. Our presentation is intended as a self-contained, albeit terse summary. Topics discussed were selected with care, to demonstrate both the completeness and a certain elegance of the theory. Proofs are not included; we only offer illustrative examples."

I countersunk the lag bolts so at a later date I can cover the 2x4s, wires, and outlet up with some kind of panel. I used 2x4s and long lag bolts instead of 1x4s or 1x3s because of the extreme amount of torque the TV at full extension could produce, despite the relatively low weight.\nDoyouwantaspoon: How long were your 2x4&gt;stud lag bolts? And what kind of hardware did you use to attach the mount to the 2x4s?\nn17ikh: I believe I used 4\" lag bolts to mount the 2x4s to the wall, and counter sunk some carriage bolts on the wall side of the 2x4s so I could attach the mount with the nuts on the mount's side, where they could be covered by the plastic decorative cover that came with the mount. I don't remember what diameter carriage bolts I used, whatever the biggest I could buy that would fit through the holes in the mount. Probably 1/4\u201d.\nDoyouwantaspoon: A carriage bolt, like with the square end before the round head?

I would say I'm the \"measure twice, cut once\" type guy, but I'm not that confident lol. More like measure 15 times, cut once. I just want to be sure it's solid on the wall so my $900 TV doesn't fall 8 feet to the ground in the middle of the night\nn17ikh: I used a 1\" paddle bit and drilled down maybe 1/4\u201d into the backside of the 2x4 to accommodate the whole head of the bolt. You don't need any extra countersinking for the square part, it's what grabs the wood and stops the bolt from turning when you put the nut on the front side. A different approach could be T-nuts on the backside of the wood with regular bolts from the front, instead of carriage bolts. That might actually be better since they're made to grip better in wood.\nDoyouwantaspoon: I have very little knowledge of carpentry hardware, so I'd never even heard of t-nuts, but they look perfect!

It's suited us very well so far, and IIRC the language provides an exception for emergency maintenance (fire, broken pipes while we're on vacation, etc). \n\nI'm not sure how fast it would hold in a court, but was worth the knowledge that he could be reasonable and compromise up front.\ngianni_: Unlike the person you replied to, legally in Ontario, Canada, landlords have to give written notice, I believe of 24 hours, that they will be entering an apartment\nkevin_the_dolphoodle: Same in California unless it\u2019s an emergency. California has extremely strong tenant rights though\nFunWithOnions: Thank god.  With how expensive it is to live here, we need renters protection against greedy landlords.\nkevin_the_dolphoodle: It\u2019s definitely good to have these protections. I own a home that I used to rent out. I gave the tenants 120 days notice to move out. I was legally obliged to give them 60, but I wanted to give them as much time as possible to find a new living situation. In the end I had to evict them and they totally took advantage of me. I do not have much extra money, and they decided to try and financially ruin me for \u201ckicking them out of their home\u201d. It can be a double edged sword for sure\naethelmund: I've read one of the better ways of dealing with this kind of thing is paying them to get the fuck out of your property, usually they take the cash rather that living for a couple months rent free\nkevin_the_dolphoodle: I know that kind of thing happens in San Francisco all the time. My brother, who was already planning on leaving, offered to leave for 50k. They offered 25k. My brother moved the same time he was planning on moving with 25k. For clarification, he was renting a rent-controlled place in the mission in SF. He had been there for 15 years and was paying 25-30% what it could have been bringing in\naethelmund: Like he wasn't paying rent and refused to leave? That's kinda shitty if that's the case\nZippyTheRobin: Comment you replied to described a \"rent controlled\" apartment, meaning the landlord can only raise the rent on a tenant at a specified, regulated rate (to prevent residents being forced out of their homes by rising rents in hypercompetitive markets such as the SF bay area). The commenter's brother offered to leave the apartment (giving up his legally given rent controlled status in exchange for the landlord buying him out) so the landlord could rent it out at current market rates.\naethelmund: AH that makes more sense now, I get it. Basically both parties knew that the place could be rented for more but the landlord couldn't charge him the market rate cause of rent control so the tenet and landlord agreed to a buy out, that's kinda cool actually, instead of having a shitty landlord and/or tenet they worked things out appropriately\n"

Bright side, most of the area seems to be on a huge slope so the tsunamis don\u2019t reach as high and far.\nPolyklietosOfAthens: I'm am architecture student in California. I can't speak for tsunamis, but I know California is the hardest state to be licensed in because the structural standards for earthquakes are so high. Most NEW buildings are very well protected from earthquakes, at least compared to the rest of the United States. Old buildings, yeah they might have some problems.\nLocalGae: That is great to hear! Do you happen to know how they deal with liquefaction? Do you also learn about tsunami proofing? And if so, can you tell me some of the measures taken?\nPolyklietosOfAthens: I'll preface this by saying my program is much more theoretical/conceptual than most. It's all about pretty artistic designs with lots of studio classes and not a whole lot of hard skills in engineering. The thought there is that every project will have loads of consultants and engineers working in it so the architect doesn't have to deal with. If there are technical issues that come up, the architect can refer to them. Common misconception, but in reality the architect is much more of a conductor than a musician, if you'll pardon the metaphor. Their main goal is to understand the legal process and ensure the building is designed to the clients agreement and to code (not built to code, that's the contractors job). \n\nLiquefaction sounds like something a surveyor would take care of. Combating that comes down a lot to the way the structural foundations are designed and built. If it's projected that in the future, say 10 years from now, the ground won't be stable enough to hold the building due to its location or soil conditions, they would likely tell the architect the site is bad and the architect would then tell the client this before an agreement is signed. It's the architects job to know a little about everything but not neccesarily deep knowledge about certain topics, that's what he/she has their team for. \n\nI have not done much research into tsunami proofing and it hasn't come up in class yet. The emphasis right now is on mitigating damage due to tectonic movement (earthquakes) and wind forces. If a building is bound to fall down anyway, we need to make sure it falls down in a way that hurts as few people as possible. California building code has no provisions that give any requirements for a building to be resistant to tsunamis. However, if a building were to be designed to resistant to tsunamis it would want to be oriented and formed in such a way that they water could flow past it easily and exert as little force as possible on it. It's like trying to push a cruise ship sideways through water, it's not going to work. That's why the ships are built narrow so the water can go around them.  \n\nHope I answered your question!\nLocalGae: Yes! Thank you so much for your time!\n"

Contrary to a common belief that overfitting hurts efficiency, we present three rather unexpected results. First, when the missing probability is correctly specified and multiple working regression models for the conditional mean are posited, calibration enjoys an oracle property: the same semiparametric efficiency bound is attained as if the true outcome model is known in advance. Second, when the missing data mechanism is misspecified, calibration can still be a consistent estimator when any one of the outcome regression models is correctly specified. Third, a common set of calibration weights can be used to improve efficiency in estimating multiple parameters of interest and can simultaneously attain semiparametric efficiency bounds for all parameters of interest. We provide connections of a wide class of calibration estimators, constructed based on generalized empirical likelihood, to many existing estimators in biostatistics, econometrics and survey sampling and perform simulation studies to show that the finite sample properties of calibration estimators conform well with the theoretical results being studied."

Second, temporal structure of birdsong is precisely controlled, meaning that temporal information is important in song analysis. Finally, notes are produced according to certain probabilistic rules, which may facilitate the accurate song recognition. We divided the procedure of song recognition into three sub-steps: local classification, boundary detection, and global sequencing, each of which corresponds to each of the three properties of birdsong. We compared the performances of several different ways to arrange these three steps. As results, we demonstrated a hybrid model of a deep neural network and a hidden Markov model is effective in recognizing birdsong with variable note sequences. We propose suitable arrangements of methods according to whether accurate boundary detection is needed. Also we designed the new measure to jointly evaluate the accuracy of note classification and boundary detection. Our methods should be applicable, with small modification and tuning, to the songs in other species that hold the three properties of the sequential vocalization."

In this work, we focus on scenarios where dependencies between doors are both positively correlated and acyclic.The fundamental distribution of a door describes the probability it opens in the best of conditions (with respect to other doors being open or closed). We show that if in two configurations of $d$ doors corresponding doors share the same fundamental distribution, then these configurations have the same optimal running time up to a universal constant, no matter what are the dependencies between doors and what are the distributions. We also identify algorithms that are optimal up to a universal constant factor. For the case in which all doors share the same fundamental distribution we additionally provide a simpler algorithm, and a formula to calculate its running time. We furthermore analyse the price of lacking feedback for several configurations governed by standard fundamental distributions. In particular, we show that the price is logarithmic in $d$ for memoryless doors, but can potentially grow to be linear in $d$ for other distributions.We then turn our attention to investigate precise bounds. Even for the case of two doors, identifying the optimal sequence is an intriguing combinatorial question. Here, we study the case of two cascading memoryless doors. That is, the first door opens on each knock independently with probability $p\\_1$. The second door can only open if the first door is open, in which case it will open on each knock independently with probability $p\\_2$. We solve this problem almost completely by identifying algorithms that are optimal up to an additive term of 1."

We first used power and sample size analysis to estimate objectively the impact of adding QCS. Then, comparisons between patients and healthy control groups using validated QCS were performed using unpaired T-tests or Mann-Whitney tests (p<0.05).Results: The application of the QCS resulted in increased statistical power, changed the values of several outcome measures, and reduced variability (SD). A significant difference was found between the T1PCr and T1Pi of MS patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, the use of a fixed correction factor led to systematically higher estimated concentrations of PCr and Pi than when using individually corrected factors. We observed significant differences between the two patient populations and healthy controls for resting [PCr] -- MS only, [Pi], [ADP], [H2PO4-] and pH -- COVID19 only, and post-exercise [PCr],[Pi] and [H2PO4-] - MS only. The dynamic indicators $\\tau$PCr, $\\tau$Pi, ViPCr and Vmax were reduced for COVID19 and MS patients compared to controls. Conclusion: Our results show that QCS in dynamic 31P-MRS studies results in smaller data variability and therefore impacts study sample size and power. Although QCS resulted in discarded data and therefore reduced the acceptable data and subject numbers, this rigorous and unbiased approach allowed for proper assessment of muscle metabolites and metabolism in patient populations. The outcomes include an increased metabolite T1, which directly affect the T1 correction factor applied to the amplitudes of the metabolite, and a prolonged $\\tau$PCr indicating reduced muscle oxidative capacity for patients with MS and COVID19."

To analyse the chemical composition of the foreground gas, all spectra were divided, in a second step, into velocity intervals over which the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ column densities and abundances were derived. Results. SH+ is detected along all observed lines of sight, with a velocity structure close to that of CH+ and 13CH+. The linewidth distributions of the CH+, SH+, and 13CH+ Gaussian components are found to be similar. These distributions have the same mean (<\\delta\\u{psion}> ~ 4.2 km s-1) and standard deviation (\\sigma(\\delta\\u{psion}) ~ 1.5 km s-1). This mean value is also close to that of the linewidth distribution of the CH+ visible transitions detected in the solar neighbourhood. We show that the lack of absorption components narrower than 2 km s-1 is not an artefact caused by noise: the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ line profiles are therefore statistically broader than those of most species detected in absorption in diffuse interstellar gas (e. g. HCO+, CH, or CN). The SH+/CH+ column density ratio observed in the components located away from the Galactic centre spans two orders of magnitude and correlates with the CH+ abundance. Conversely, the ratio observed in the components close to the Galactic centre varies over less than one order of magnitude with no apparent correlation with the CH+ abundance. The observed dynamical and chemical properties of SH+ and CH+ are proposed to trace the ubiquitous process of turbulent dissipation, in shocks or shears, in the diffuse ISM and the specific environment of the Galactic centre regions."

So to those of you who are older and wiser than me, how do I grow up happy in this cult of self expression we live in?\ncchap22: My wife and I have been discussing this since seeing your beautifully worded question. \n\nI have 2 answers. The first one stems from a discussion from a dying mother on her death bed. She explained that looking back in your life you aren't going to care about how you looked on your date in junior year of high school, how good your hair looked in 10th grade  or the days binging your favorite shows. You remember the loved ones around you, the life that created you, and the life you create. Family and people will bring you moments of true and utter bliss... happiness\n\nAnswer #2 Only with true sorrow can you achieve true happiness. You have to live the dark to feel the light. You are going, 14 years old, my guess is you have never hit rock bottom, you have never wanted to die more than live, and as such you have never been lifted out of this. Right now most everything in your life is plastic, fake and skin deep. I know this sounds kind of brutal but it's true. You haven't had to slave your fingers to the bone to ensure you're child has food on there plate,  so you haven't experienced the warm feeling of watching them eat knowing you provided that life. \n\nA good example of this was when I was about 22 years old. My gf and me at the time were being evicted, she just lost her job and her car was totalled. We were facing the prospect of living homeless and had not eaten in almost 2 whole days. It was pure misery. My parents ended up letting us move in until we saved enough to be back on our feet. Waking up that next morning in a clean bed, central heating, breakfast on the skillet, and Sunday morning cartoons... that is true happiness. It washes over you like a warmth and you never forget\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X-7558NYtwY\nscottd3363: It makes me smile to know that my question was enough to spark a discussion between you and your wife.

There is so much we can do to avoid the negative educational and health outcomes caused during the last school year. \n\nThis article's points are smart, but require even more thought. Yes, schools should ensure remote-learning is possible from their students if that is part of their Delta contingency plan. But they also need to consider other variable. Are lesson plans appropriate? Is the technology supportive? \n\nAnd of course, they need to consider the health of students. How are schools emotionally and mentally supporting students if we go into lockdown?\nr0gu39: As a teacher - we know remote learning was less than stellar.  We know hybrid was difficult.  We know kids learn better in school.  This pandemic has taught me that everyone thinks they know how to do my job better than me - and yet know one is stepping up to be a teacher while states are hemorrhaging teachers.  I have learned that teachers (and schools to some extent) are expected to fill every role and solve every problem in a child's life while facing constant upheaval and criticism.\n\nAnd if we complain - tHiS iS wHaT yOu SiGnEd Up FoR!\nSnappaDaBagels: To a degree, yes, teachers are expected to fill every role in helping a child develop properly. And that is the job.\n\nWhere I see the failure is in how we support teachers. Providing the knowledge and tools to successfully teach in a Covid-19 world is the job of school administrators, all the way up to local, state, and federal governments.\n\nFor example, have you been giving extra guidance or training on how to teach remote? Did your district outfit you with the office setup and internet connectivity to do this? Were you students given the same treatment? \n\nI agree teachers face the brunt of criticism and that isn't fair. The people who need to do better aren't teachers, it's the folks planning and appropriating dollars behind them.\nr0gu39: To be honest - we were able to take laptops and our course textbooks home.  That was it.  We had some trainings, but most were on technology and programs many of us already used.  Our \"best practices\" PD was all window dressing and no substance.  Administration and government offered \"trainings\" that didn't apply or wouldn't actually work in practice - and that was all we got.\nSnappaDaBagels: Isn't that insane? Here you are being asked to do your job in a totally different way. And you get no support. Of course there will be failure. \n\nI don't fault school districts for failing in 2020. Everyone was trying to react to a changing world. \n\nBut I will fault districts in 2021. They've now had over a year to build up a process to teach in a Covid-19 world. We should expect they support teachers much more, and that this in turn makes the student experience that much better too.\nr0gu39: Hopefully they do offer more support.

If someone is making small talk that they just want me to listen to, then I use the smile and nod with an occasional \"Uh huh!\", and pick up the gist of what they are saying through the various bits of the sentence I can properly hear. I do this now almost subconsciously, and I've become VERY good at putting together the general message they are trying to convey, even though I hear probably 50% of it. I'm also VERY in tune with body language. So much of conversation is unspoken, if you can learn to trust your instinct with the body language and even gather bits and pieces of a conversation you would be amazed at how well people think you are listening. Most people say I'm one of the best listeners they have ever talked to, but really half of what they are saying I don't hear, so the other half I intently focus on, and I basically pantomime their body langue back at them, it really gives a great impression of empathy, and I just use canned responses in combination, to come off as understanding.\n\nIn those circumstances where the conversation warrants a back and forth I just do the best I can. If I can't understand them I simply say \"Sorry, I can't hear you can you repeat that?\". If I have to ask more than twice I explain that my hearing is unfortunately not that great, and almost everyone has been very understanding. Some people laugh at me when I explain why my hearing is sub-par, and then I ask them what is funny about the situation, and move on to a better person who isn't going to judge me over what I perceive as a very, very small inconvenience to them.\n[deleted]: Ok thanks, I'll try to read body language. But I already do the \"Uh-uh\" smile, etc. thing and I end up agreeing or laughing if it's a joke that I didn't even understand what they said. Sometimes one of my ears goes a little deaf but it comes back after a couple of minutes. It happens with either my left or right. I'll still go see a professional and see what it might be.

In this paper, we study two other frameworks of routing games in which each of several players has an integer number of connections (which are population of packets) to route and where there is a constraint that a connection cannot be split. Through a particular game with a simple three link topology, we identify various novel and surprising properties of games within these frameworks. We show in particular that equilibria are non unique even in the potential game setting of Rosenthal with strictly convex link costs. We further show that non-symmetric equilibria arise in symmetric networks. I. INTRODUCTION A central question in routing games has been to establish conditions for the uniqueness of the equilibria, either in terms of the network topology or in terms of the costs. A survey on these issues is given in [1]. The question of uniqueness of equilibria has been studied in two different frameworks. The first, which we call F1, is the non-atomic routing introduced by Wardrop on 1952 in the context of road traffic in which each player (car) is infinitesimally small; a single car has a negligible impact on the congestion. Each car wishes to minimize its expected delay. Under arbitrary topology, such games are known to have a convex potential and thus have a unique equilibrium [2]. The second framework, denoted by F2, is splitable atomic games. There are finitely many players, each controlling the route of a population of individuals. This type of games have already been studied in the context of road traffic by Haurie and Marcotte [3] but have become central in the telecom community to model routing decisions of Internet Service Providers that can decide how to split the traffic of their subscribers among various routes so as to minimize network congestion [4]. In this paper we study properties of equilibria in two other frameworks of routing games which exhibit surprising"

We managed to determine the disk extension in the line and the nearby continuum for most targets. We also constrained the disk kinematics, showing that it is dominated by rotation with a rotation law close to the Keplerian one. Our survey also suggests that these stars are rotating at a mean velocity of V/V$_{\\rm c}$\\,=\\,0.82\\,$\\pm$\\,0.08. This corresponds to a rotational rate of $\\Omega/\\Omega_{\\rm c}$\\,=\\,0.95\\,$\\pm$\\,0.02 Conclusions. We did not detect any correlation between the stellar parameters and the structure of the circumstellar environment. Moreover, it seems that a simple model of a geometrically thin Keplerian disk can explain most of our spectrally resolved K-band data. Nevertheless, some small departures from this model have been detected for at least two objects (i.e, $\\kappa$ CMa and $\\alpha$ Col). Finally, our Be stars sample suggests that rotation is the main physical process driving the mass-ejection. Nevertheless, smaller effects from other mechanisms have to be taken into account to fully explain how the residual gravity is compensated."

According to her, she never really knows what to say to him sometimes and from my perspective it seems as if I have a much better shot with her than he does.\u00a0\n\n\nSo I said I'd do my best to get out that night and I did.

The absence of a general framework for executing perceptions/actions poses as a major hindrance to using them opportunistically -- the essence of open-ended search in problem solving. Our goal is to develop a framework for executing a wide variety of specified perceptions and actions across tasks/domains without human intervention. We observe that the domain/task-specific visual perceptions/actions can be transformed into domain/task-independent spatial problems. We specify a spatial problem as a quantified constraint satisfaction problem in the real domain using an open-ended vocabulary of properties, relations and actions involving three kinds of diagrammatic objects -- points, curves, regions. Solving a spatial problem from this specification requires computing the equivalent simplified quantifier-free expression, the complexity of which is inherently doubly exponential. We represent objects as configuration of simple elements to facilitate decomposition of complex problems into simpler and similar subproblems. We show that, if the symbolic solution to a subproblem can be expressed concisely, quantifiers can be eliminated from spatial problems in low-order polynomial time using similar previously solved subproblems. This requires determining the similarity of two problems, the existence of a mapping between them computable in polynomial time, and designing a memory for storing previously solved problems so as to facilitate search. The efficacy of the idea is shown by time complexity analysis. We demonstrate the proposed approach by executing perceptions and actions involved in DR tasks in two army applications."

We show that one of the D-well-founded semantics, defined by Pelov, Denecker, and Bruynooghe for a broader class of aggregates using approximating operators, coincides with the well-founded model as defined in this work on LPAma programs. We also discuss some complexity issues, most importantly we give a formal proof of tractable computation of the well-founded model for LPA programs. Moreover, we prove that for general LPA programs, which may contain aggregates that are neither monotone nor antimonotone, deciding satisfaction of aggregate expressions with respect to partial interpretations is coNP-complete. As a consequence, a well-founded semantics for general LPA programs that allows for tractable computation is unlikely to exist, which justifies the restriction on LPAma programs. Finally, we present a prototype system extending DLV, which supports the well-founded semantics for LPAma programs, at the time of writing the only implemented system that does so. Experiments with this prototype show significant computational advantages of aggregate constructs over equivalent aggregate-free encodings."

Edit: I will do my best to help everyone I can but I am very busy at work right now and I have had at least 15 messages sent to me so far\n\nIMPORTANT EDIT: *You* do not have to buy out your lease first to sell your car. When you sell the car to the dealer just mention to them that there is a payoff on the vehicle still and they will get the necessary info to pay the lease off on YOUR behalf just like they would if you traded a car with a payoff still on it.\nJoethemofoe: Why would it matter how much it's worth if you signed a lease for 2 years? Isn't it just turn it back in when your done?\nLinkedPioneer: Sure, you can just turn the lease in when the lease ends. \n\nThat\u2019s beneficial to you if you have *negative equity* because you can just hand them the keys and walk away without paying a cent (unless you\u2019re over on miles and have to pay a mileage penalty.) \n\nBut if the car is worth *more* than the payoff amount you\u2019d be a fool to turn it in instead of selling it to a dealer.\nJoethemofoe: I guess I'm not understanding how a lease works\nLinkedPioneer: When a lease ends you typically have four options;\n\n1.) Turn in the car to a dealer and walk away\n\n2.) Buy out the lease\n\n3.) Trade it in towards a new vehicle\n\n4.) (If the car is worth MORE than what the lease payoff amount is) you can SELL the car to a dealer and get a check back for the equity!\nJoethemofoe: Your assuming they won't charge you makert value either\nCharmingTuber: No, that's the piece you're missing. The buyout price is set when you sign the lease. They know how cars depreciate, so it's all set in stone in your lease agreement.\n\nBut that was set two+years ago when the car market wasn't upsidedown. Now, you can buy it off at that original depreciation and sell it back at the current market rate.\nJoethemofoe: I get it now. I've never leased before only bought\nCharmingTuber: It's cool.

First, thesize of the boundary layer on the western and eastern boundary, whichhad already been computed by several authors, becomes formally verylarge as one approaches northern and southern portions of the boudary,i.e. pieces of the boundary on which the normal is vertical. Thisphenomenon is known as geostrophic degeneracy. In order to avoid suchsingular behaviour, previous studies imposed restrictive assumptionson the domain $\\Omega$ and on the forcing term $\\tau$. Here, we provethat a superposition of two boundary layers occurs in the vicinity ofsuch points: the classical western or eastern boundary layers, andsome northern or southern boundary layers, whose mathematicalderivation is completely new. The size of northern/southern boundarylayers is much larger than the one of western boundary layers($\\mathfrak{E}^{1/4}$ vs. $\\mathfrak{E}^{1/3}$). We explain in detail how the superpositiontakes place, depending on the geometry of the boundary.Moreover, when the domain $\\Omega$ is not connex in the $x$ direction,$\\psi^0$ is not continuous in $\\Omega$, and singular layers appear inorder to correct its discontinuities. These singular layers areconcentrated in the vicinity of horizontal lines, and thereforepenetrate the interior of the domain $\\Omega$. Hence we exhibit some kindof boundary layer separation. However, we emphasize that we remainable to prove a convergence theorem, so that the singular layerssomehow remain stable, in spite of the separation.Eventually, the effect of boundary layers is non-local in severalaspects. On the first hand, for algebraic reasons, the boundary layerequation is radically different on the west and east parts of theboundary. As a consequence, the Sverdrup equation is endowed with aDirichlet condition on the East boundary, and no condition on the Westboundary. Therefore western and eastern boundary layers have in factan influence on the whole domain $\\Omega$, and not only near theboundary. On the second hand, the northern and southern boundary layerprofiles obey a propagation equation, where the space variable $x$plays the role of time, and are therefore not local."

Initially, each player is given only his/her own identity, except the mafia, who are given the identities of all mafia members. At each ``open'' round, a vote is made to determine which player to eliminate. Additionally, there are collective decisions made by the mafia where they decide to eliminate a citizen. Finally, each detective accumulates data on the mafia/citizen status of players. The citizens win if they eliminate all mafia members. Otherwise, the mafia wins. We first find a randomized strategy that is optimal in the absence of detectives. This leads to a stochastic asymptotic analysis where it is shown that the two groups have comparable probabilities of winning exactly when the total population size is $R$ and the mafia size is of order $\\sqrt{R}$. We then show that even a single detective changes the qualitative behavior of the game dramatically. Here, the mafia and citizens have comparable winning probabilities only for a mafia size linear in $R$. Finally, we provide a summary of simulations complementing the theoretical results obtained in the paper."

To the best of our knowledge, the previously known algorithms have at least quadratic complexity bounds. Our algorithm computes a symbolic decomposition in $O(M(D) log(D))$ arithmetic operations, where $M(D)$ is the complexity of multiplying two polynomials of degree D. It is deterministic when the decomposition is unique. When the decomposition is not unique, our algorithm is randomized. We present a Monte Carlo version of it and we show how to modify it to a Las Vegas one, within the same complexity. From the symbolic decomposition, we approximate the terms of the decomposition with an error of $2^{--$\\epsilon$}$ , in $O(D log^2(D) (log^2(D) + log($\\epsilon$)))$ arithmetic operations. We use results from Kaltofen and Yagati (1989) to bound the size of the representation of the coefficients involved in the decomposition and we bound the algebraic degree of the problem by min(rank, D -- rank + 1). We show that this bound can be tight. When the input polynomial has integer coefficients, our algorithm performs, up to poly-logarithmic factors, $O\\_{bit} (D{\\ell} + D^4 + D^3 $\\tau$)$ bit operations, where $$\\tau$$ is the maximum bitsize of the coefficients and $2^{--{\\ell}}$ is the relative error of the terms in the decomposition."

We aim to equip scannerless generalized parsers with novel disambiguation methods that are inherently performant, without compromising the concerns of modularity and language composition. **Approach** In this paper, we present a novel low-overhead implementation technique for disambiguating deep associativity and priority conflicts in scannerless generalized parsers with lightweight data-dependency. **Knowledge** Ambiguities with respect to operator precedence and associativity arise from combining the various operators of a language. While *shallow conflicts* can be resolved efficiently by one-level tree patterns, *deep conflicts* require more elaborate techniques, because they can occur arbitrarily nested in a tree. Current state-of-the-art approaches to solving deep priority conflicts come with a severe performance overhead. **Grounding** We evaluated our new approach against state-of-the-art declarative disambiguation mechanisms. By parsing a corpus of popular open-source repositories written in Java and OCaml, we found that our approach yields speedups of up to 1.73x over a grammar rewriting technique when parsing programs with deep priority conflicts--with a modest overhead of 1-2 % when parsing programs without deep conflicts. **Importance** A recent empirical study shows that deep priority conflicts are indeed wide-spread in real-world programs. The study shows that in a corpus of popular OCaml projects on Github, up to 17 % of the source files contain deep priority conflicts. However, there is no solution in the literature that addresses efficient disambiguation of deep priority conflicts, with support for modular and composable syntax definitions."

I think there are good reasons someone should go to college: if you want a professional degree (doctor, lawyer, etc), if you want to go into academia, if you just want to learn more... \n\nThe community college model is probably a better alternative, as are trade and vocational schools, since those lead to good, stable careers which are necessary for society. But our culture looks down on those jobs, so we tell people to go to college, and colleges love it because they can make more money. \n\nThe fact that we think of college as worthless apart from networking (not to pick on you, because this is a fairly common viewpoint) is a result of devaluing college education by telling everyone to do it. If someone goes to an expensive but low-tier college, skips all their classes, majors in something they don't really care about, and then finds out that they've graduated in debt, jobless, and having gained nothing from the experience except a few friends, *of course* they're going to think college is a pointless exercise in networking, because for them that's what it was. \n\nI sympathize with people who want college to be free or who want everyone to go, because they want everyone to have more opportunities, but the fact is there are so many good jobs that are understaffed because we don't encourage people to do them. Electricians, plumbers, and other blue-collar professions are so important and it's awful that we don't treat them as such. \njurmyhyle: Money is the reason why.  \u201cWe\u201d don\u2019t tell kids to go to college.  \u201cWe\u201d don\u2019t tell kids to not learn a trade.

They\u2019re especially keen on rich international students these days.\nFyodorToastoevsky: Oh absolutely. I said as much, and I used \"we\" because where the money goes, so goes the culture. [Here's an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/us/international-enrollment-drop.html) from the NYT today talking about how second-tier schools are facing budget problems due to declining numbers of international students.

The goal of this paper is to compare how metaprobability theory and Dempster-Shafer theory handle the adjustment of beliefs with evidence with respect to a particular thought experiment. Sections 2 and 3 give brief descriptions of the metaprobability and Dempster-Shafer theories. Metaprobability theory deals with higher order probabilities applied to evidential reasoning. Dempster-Shafer theory is a generalization of probability theory which has evolved from a theory of upper and lower probabilities. Section 4 describes a thought experiment and the metaprobability and DempsterShafer analysis of the experiment. The thought experiment focuses on forming beliefs about a population with 6 types of members {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. A type is uniquely defined by the values of three features: A, B, C. That is, if the three features of one member of the population were known then its type could be ascertained. Each of the three features has two possible values, (e.g. A can be either \"a0\" or \"al\"). Beliefs are formed from evidence accrued from two sensors: sensor A, and sensor B. Each sensor senses the corresponding defining feature. Sensor A reports that half of its observations are \"a0\" and half the observations are 'al'. Sensor B reports that half of its observations are ``b0,' and half are \"bl\". Based on these two pieces of evidence, what should be the beliefs on the distribution of types in the population? Note that the third feature is not observed by any sensor."

In this work we identify some natural additional conditions on deterministic balancing algorithms, resulting in a class of algorithms reaching a smaller discrepancy. This class contains well-known algorithms, eg., the Rotor-Router. Specifically, we introduce the notion of cumulatively fair load-balancing algorithms where in any interval of consecutive time steps, the total number of tokens sent out over an edge by a node is the same (up to constants) for all adjacent edges. We prove that algorithms which are cumulatively fair and where every node retains a sufficient part of its load in each step, achieve a discrepancy of $O(\\min\\{d\\sqrt{\\log n/\\mu},d\\sqrt{n}\\})$ in time $O(T)$. We also show that in general neither of these assumptions may be omitted without increasing discrepancy. We then show by a combinatorial potential reduction argument that any cumulatively fair scheme satisfying some additional assumptions achieves a discrepancy of $O(d)$ almost as quickly as the continuous diffusion process. This positive result applies to some of the simplest and most natural discrete load balancing schemes."

Whereas pesticide use in conventional farming has led to the spread of [pests that are immune to the available pesticides](http://ocj.com/2015/10/palmer-amaranth-update/).\nCanadairy: &gt; no synthetic fertilizer\n\nTrue, but they can get manure from animals fed feed grown with synthetic fertilizer. So in a roundabout way, they do use synthetic.\n\n&gt; nitrogen runoff is a big problem\n\nTrue, but not limited to synthetic fertilizers or to conventional farming. Organic pig shit can wash into a waterway just as well as conventional pig shit. Runoff prevention is a management issue, not a organic/conventional issue.\n\n&gt; more reliant on using crop rotation, compost, cover crops, etc.\n\nPretty well everyone uses some form of crop rotation. At minimum, corn/soybeans. In my area cash croppers grow corn, soy, wheat, repeat. Occasionally with something like oats, canola, or edible beans tossed in as well. Compost, well if it isn't coming from their farm then it's probably the result of synthetic nitrogen. Cover crops are something that are gaining in popularity in conventional farming, with the caveat that they don't work everywhere. \n\nAs far as pesticides go, organic can still use them. Some of them are far more toxic than the conventional alternatives (especially copper based ones). I've never understood what the point of claiming pesticide resistant weeds is a detriment of using pesticides. If all current pesticides used in conventional agriculture ceased to be effective we'd be back to... organic pest control.\nbizaromo: I think we can both agree that well managed farms (organic or conventional) that control runoff are more \"sustainable\" than organic-or-conventional farms that don't control runoff and let their topsoil go to shit. Not pig shit, per se, just shitty shit. Still, better pig shit than human shit (sorry, I mean sludge, I mean organic bio-solid soil amendment).\n\nJust out of curiosity, what kind of dairy operation do you run? Do you grow your own feed? Or are they (the cows) pastured? I'm guessing they're not organic...\nCanadairy: 60 Jersey cows. We grow our own forages (alfalfa/clover hay and haylage, and corn silage), and buy our grain ration. We had grown grain corn to feed, however we ran into issues with quality and opted to purchase a prepared ration. Pasturing cattle year round really isn't feasible in Canada - too many frostbitten teats and ears, not to mention the lack of grass. The girls spend most of the warm weather outside, but supplemented with more feed at milking time. I wouldn't go organic unless absolutely forced. I like my cows too much to see them die from easily cured infections.\n"

We first review experimental results from the literature and we point out the main factors (physical properties, experimental procedure) at the origin of flow inhomogeneities and nonlocal effects. It leads us to propose a well-defined procedure to ensure that steady-state bulk properties of the materials are studied. We use this procedure to investigate yield stress fluid flows with MRI techniques. We focus on nonthixotropic dense suspensions of soft particles (foams, concentrated emulsions, Carbopol gels). We show that, as long as they are studied in a wide (as compared to the size of the material mesoscopic elements) gap geometry, these materials behave as 'simple yield stress fluids': they are homogeneous, they do not exhibit steady-state shear banding, and their steady flow behavior in simple shear can be modeled by a local continuous monotonic constitutive equation which accounts for flows in various conditions and matches the macroscopic response."

In terms of frames of discernment, the basic probability assignment (bpa) and belief function can be defined. Dempster's combination rule is applicable. This extension of probabilistic logic is called the evidential logic in [ 1]. For each proposition s, its belief function is represented by an interval [Spt(s), Pls(s)]. When all such intervals collapse to single points, the evidential logic reduces to probabilistic logic (in the generalized version of not necessarily consistent interpretations). Certainly, we get Nilsson's probabilistic logic by further restricting to consistent interpretations. In the third section, we shall give a probabilistic interpretation of probabilistic logic in terms of multi-dimensional random variables. This interpretation brings the probabilistic logic into the framework of probability theory. Let us consider a finite set S = {sl, s2, ..., Sn) of logical propositions. Each proposition may have true or false values; and may be considered as a random variable. We have a probability distribution for each proposition. The e-dimensional random variable (sl,..., Sn) may take values in the space of all interpretations of 2n binary vectors. We may compute absolute (marginal), conditional and joint probability distributions. It turns out that the permissible probabilistic interpretation vector of Nilsson [12] consists of the joint probabilities of S. Inconsistent interpretations will not appear, by setting their joint probabilities to be zeros. By summing appropriate joint probabilities, we get probabilities of individual propositions or subsets of propositions. Since the Bayes formula and other techniques are valid for e-dimensional random variables, the probabilistic logic is actually very close to the Bayesian inference schemes. In the last section, we shall consider a relaxation scheme for probabilistic logic. In this system, not only new evidences will update the belief measures of a collection of propositions, but also constraint satisfaction among these propositions in the relational network will revise these measures. This mechanism is similar to human reasoning which is an evaluative process converging to the most satisfactory result. The main idea arises from the consistent labeling problem in computer vision. This method is originally applied to scene analysis of line drawings. Later, it is applied to matching, constraint satisfaction and multi sensor fusion by several authors [8], [16] (and see references cited there). Recently, this method is used in knowledge aggregation by Landy and Hummel [9]."

Screws will last a lot longer than nails if you can manage to get them installed. The kind of screws you want are \"decking\" or \"exterior coated\" screws. If you have trouble driving them in, use a 1/8\" drill bit to predrill the holes. Go about the length of the screw minus half an inch deep with the drill bit, then drive the screw in the hole.\n[deleted]: Yeah, no exterior coated anything. A few rust coated screws about the same size/shape that I could clean off. \n\nThe nails are left-overs from when we (my neighbors and beer) put together a patio, but I can only assume (because the neighbour got them, not us) that they were rated for outdoors.\njakkarth: If they're not coated, they'll rot/rust. That'll lead to poor structural performance (your fence falls apart) and discoloration (black stains trailing down from the screw heads). In some cases the exterior rated screws are also stronger than their interior counterparts.\n[deleted]: What i'm taking from that is \"Exterior coated nails, though inferior to exterior coated screws, are preferable to interior coated screws\"?\njakkarth: That is my recommendation, yes. I would not build a fence for my mother using anything less than exterior coated screws, but given a choice between galvanized/exterior nails and drywall/interior screws, I'd go with the nails.\n[deleted]: Thanks, your mother is a lucky lady. I'm going to grab some exterior screws later in the day, and make sure to drill in some holes before I try to install 'em.\n\nAlso, the pliers didn't work to pull out the screw, it just stripped the screw more. So I cut it off. Is that \"ok\", or are there screw-removal pliers is should look into?\njakkarth: I'd probably leave it. The [vice grip](http://tungstencarbidefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/vicegrip.jpg) pliers are my go-to for removing screws with broken-off heads, so if that didn't work you're probably better off just cutting it off.

        "text": " might miss contextual information relevant to find the root cause of bugs. On the other hand, online debuggers do allow debugging a program upon a failure while providing contextual information (e.g., stack trace). In particular, remote online debuggers enable debugging of devices without physical access to them. However, they experience debugging interference due to network delays which complicates bug reproducibility, and have limited support for dynamic software updates on remote devices. Approach: This paper proposes out-of-things debugging, an online debugging approach especially designed for IoT systems. The debugger is always-on as it ensures constant availability to for instance debug post-deployment situations. Upon a failure or breakpoint, out-of-things debugging moves the state of a deployed application to the developer's machine. Developers can then debug the application locally by applying operations (e.g., step commands) to the retrieved state. Once debugging is finished, developers can commit bug fixes to the device through live update capabilities. Finally, by means of a fine-grained flexible interface for accessing remote resources, developers have full control over the debugging overhead imposed on the device, and the access to device hardware resources (e.g., sensors) needed during local debugging. Knowledge: Out-of-things debugging maintains good properties of remote debugging as it does not require physical access to the device to debug it, while reducing debugging interference since there are no network delays on operations (e.g., stepping) issued on the debugger since those happen locally. Furthermore, device resources are only accessed when requested by the user which further mitigates overhead and opens avenues for mocking or simulation of non-accessed resources. Grounding: We implemented an out-of-things debugger as an extension to a WebAssembly Virtual Machine and benchmarked its suitability for IoT. In particular, we compared our solution to remote debugging alternatives based on metrics such as network overhead, memory usage, scalability, and usability in production settings. From the benchmarks, we conclude that our debugger exhibits competitive performance in addition to confining overhead without sacrificing debugging convenience and flexibility. Importance: Out-of-things debugging enables debugging of IoT systems by means of classical online operations (e.g., stepwise execution) while addressing IoT-specific concerns (e.g., hardware limitations). We show that having the debugger always-on does not have to come at cost of performance loss or increased overhead but instead can enforce a smooth-going and flexible debugging experience of IoT systems."

His exclusion principle, his influence on Werner Heisenberg in the formulation of matrix mechanics, his emphasis on firm logical and empirical foundations, his creativity in formulating electron spinors, his neutrino hypothesis, and his dialogues with other quantum physicists, all point to Pauli being the dominant genius in the development of quantum theory. Because Pauli was in a difficult individuation process during his early years, his own writings on philosophy tend to be sparse and often contradictory. My analysis of Pauli's physics and philosophy is based upon published and unpublished sources, and Pauli's later reflections. A pattern has emerged. Pauli changed his mind from relying on high rationality and empiricism, to valuing intuitive metaphysical visualizations. This coupled with disturbing events in his life precipitated a breakdown and led Pauli to seek treatment at the Jung Clinic. Pauli's psychological tension diminished after 1932. His physics consistently involved symmetry and invariants. His philosophy allied with Jung's resembled a Platonism of combined psyche and physics. Pauli sought a rational unification and foundation for his philosophy, but that goal was cut short by his untimely death at the age of 58."

On smaller length scales, inside the branches, small silica aggregates are present. Their average radius has been deduced from a Kratky analysis, and it ranges between 35 and 40 nm for all silica fractions investigated here (\\phi_si = 8-21% vol.). A central piece of our analysis is the description of the interaggregate interaction by a simulated structure factor for polydisperse spheres representing aggregates. A polydispersity of 30% in aggregate size is assumed, and interactions between these aggregates are described with a hard core repulsive potential. The same distribution in size is used to evaluate the polydisperse form factor. Comparison with the experimental intensity leads to the determination of the average aggregate compacity (assumed identical for all aggregates in the distribution, between 31% and 38% depending on \\phi_si), and thus aggregation number (ca. 45, with a large spread). Because of the effect of aggregate compacity and of pure polymer zones, the volume fraction of aggregates is higher in the branches than \\phi_si. The repulsion between aggregates has a strong effect on the apparent isothermal compressibility: it leads to a characteristic low-q depression, which cannot be interpreted as aggregate mass decrease in our data. In addition, the reinforcement effect of these silica structures in the SBR-matrix is characterized with oscillatory shear and described with a model based on the same aggregate compacity. Finally, our results show that it is possible to analyze the complex structure of interacting aggregates in nanocomposites of industrial origin in a self-consistent and quantitative manner."

Her 4-month-old son weighed only five pounds - two less than at birth - and her daughter was in even worse shape. At 18 months, she weighed only 12 pounds, and soon lost four more.\n\n&gt; When Dr. Jackson questioned the woman, who had 10 other children, he discovered that she had never breast-fed her two youngest. Their diets since birth had been infant formula. Because the family income averaged only $7 a week, the mother had to heavily dilute the expensive formula to make it last longer. ''For the 4-month-old baby,'' Dr. Jackson later told Senator Edward M. Kennedy's Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research, ''one tin of feed should have lasted for something just under three days. She said that one tin of feed lasted two weeks to feed both of the children.''\nSchulzArmy: This states she insanely diluted the formula she was giving her kids.. How is this Nestle's fault?

Their water is not safe to drink and that's how you mix the formula.\n\nAn ad campaign was done that \"educated\" people that formula was a better choice than breast feeding. The formula was provided free until the mothers milk dried up and then they were charged for it.\n\n\nThis was intentionally done to many families and killed many children. The company got families who have no disposable income hooked to expwnsive formulas and then  the families were forced to buy the formula. It is sick and criminal. \n\n"

The \"tailored\" approach re-implements a new, non-bootstrapped implementation of the system to debootstrap. Currently, the \"tailored\" approach is dominant for low-level system components (C, coreutils), and the \"archaeological\" approach is dominant among the few higher-level languages that were debootstrapped. Approach: We advocate for the benefits of \"tailored\" debootstrapping implementations of high-level languages. The new implementation needs not be production-ready, it suffices that it is able to run the reference implementation correctly. We argue that this is feasible with a reasonable development effort, with several side benefits besides debootstrapping. Knowledge: We propose a specific design of composing/stacking several implementations: a reference interpreter for the language of interest, implemented in a small subset of the language, and a compiler for this small subset (in another language). Developing a reference interpreter is valuable independently of debootstrapping: it may help clarify the language semantics, and can be reused for other purposes such as differential testing of the other implementations. Grounding: We present Camlboot, our project to debootstrap the OCaml compiler, version 4.07. Once we converged on this final design, the last version of Camlboot took about a person-month of implementation effort, demonstrating feasibility. Using diverse double-compilation, we were able to prove the absence of trusting trust attack in the existing bootstrap of the standard OCaml implementation. Importance: To our knowledge, this document is the first scholarly discussion of \"tailored\" debootstrapping for high-level programming languages. Debootstrapping is an interesting problem which recently grew an active community of free software contributors, but so far the interactions with the programming-language research community have been minimal. We share our experience on Camlboot, trying to highlight aspects that are of interest to other language designers and implementors; we hope to foster stronger ties between the Bootstrappable project and relevant academic communities. In particular, the debootstrapping experience has been an interesting reflection on OCaml design and implementation, and we hope that other language implementors would find it equally valuable."

I\u2019ve seen many very experienced fighters knocked out at competitions with these moves. The reason you don\u2019t see them more is they are blind maneuvers and require a much higher level of precision and control than a side kick.\nNeuro-Sysadmin: In terms of energy transferred, I\u2019d be curious to see the numbers on each kick. I would suspect a back-side kick would impact harder, but I admit I don\u2019t have the data on that.\n\nFor clarity\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll add that I was referring to a kick like the one shown, turning toward the back with the back leg, but moving the back leg linearly out into a side kick at the end of the turn instead of keeping the knee bent and sweeping the foot around. Not a basic side kick where your torso faces the front the entire time.\n\nAlso, the power of the kick used in the video could have been higher if it was a back-spinning kick instead of a spinning-back kick - with the kicking leg straight as it rotates around, instead of bent. Granted, that would have been much slower and harder to pull off. \n\nNot sure why any of those 3 kicks (or the spinning backfist) would need to be performed truly blind though. I was always taught that the goal was to acquire the target while turning, at least in an ideal state. Doesn\u2019t always work out, but there should usually be a decent chance to manage it.\n\nP.s. Not saying I haven\u2019t thrown plenty of kicks just like that one (knee bent, with rotation) especially in competition, when hitting the target beats theoretical form, because I definitely have. Nor am I saying it didn\u2019t get the job done, that was a great KO!\n\nJust clarifying my earlier statement with the thought that either the leg-fully-extended, rotating motion of a back-spinning kick (striking with the back/bottom of heel first) or the turn-and-linear-extension of a back-side kick (bottom of heel striking first) would have imparted greater power that that kick, (rotating, knee bent, striking with the bottom of the foot) from a physics perspective of the techniques.\n\nEdit: TKD terminology and experience basis, on my end. We don\u2019t use hand techniques to the head in competition, fwiw, and the terms for the kicks might be somewhat different, which is why I added the attempt at extra descriptions. The physics should be the same, though, and the three variations of spinning/turning kicks should all be performed very similarly between Taekwondo and Karate, afaik. YMMV.\npurenergy12: As far as power I suppose up for debate. But they are certainly both blind maneuvers and as such are not allowed in many competitions. That split second when you turn and snap your head around you lose sight of the opponent. Less experienced fighters can cause a lot more than a knockout in this situation so leaving it to the experts makes sense. To me as far as the power thing goes the spin makes sense. Think about throwing a discus. It\u2019s the spin that brings the power.\n"

The measurements could be done up to 2.5 kHz, with a novel high-resolution modal analysis technique (see the ICA companion-paper, Ege and Boutillon (2010)). Above 1.1 kHz, the change in the observed modal density together with numerical simulations confirm Berthaut's finding that the waves in the soundboard are confined between adjacent ribs (Berthaut et al. 2003). Extending the Skudrzyk and Langley approaches, we synthesize the mechanical mobility at the bridge up to 2.5 kHz. The validity of the computation for an extended spectral domain is discussed. It is also shown that the evolution of the modal density with frequency is consistent with the rise of mobility (fall of impedance) in this frequency range and that both are due to the inter-rib effect appearing when the half-wavelength becomes equal to the rib spacing. Results match previous observations by Wogram (1980), Conklin (1996), Giordano (1998), Nakamura (1983) and could be used for numerical simulations for example. This approach avoids the detailed description of the soundboard, based on a very high number of parameters.

        "text": ". Results. We provide expressions for the collision probability of dust by planetesimals and for the filtering efficiency by a swarm of planetesimals. For standard turbulence conditions (i.e., a turbulence parameter $\\alpha=10^{-2}$), filtering is found to be inefficient, meaning that when crossing a minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) belt of planetesimals extending between 0.1 AU and 35 AU most dust particles are eventually accreted by the central star rather than colliding with planetesimals. However, if the disk is weakly turbulent ($\\alpha=10^{-4}$) filtering becomes efficient in two regimes: (i) when planetesimals are all smaller than about 10 km in size, in which case collisions mostly take place in the geometric regime; and (ii) when planetary embryos larger than about 1000 km in size dominate the distribution, have a scale height smaller than one tenth of the gas scale height, and dust is of millimeter size or larger in which case most collisions take place in the settling regime. These two regimes have very different properties: we find that the local filtering efficiency $x_{filter,MMSN}$ scales with $r^{-7/4}$ (where $r$ is the orbital distance) in the geometric regime, but with $r^{-1/4}$ to $r^{1/4}$ in the settling regime. This implies that the filtering of dust by small planetesimals should occur close to the central star and with a short spread in orbital distances. On the other hand, the filtering by embryos in the settling regime is expected to be more gradual and determined by the extent of the disk of embryos. Dust particles much smaller than millimeter size tend only to be captured by the smallest planetesimals because they otherwise move on gas streamlines and their collisions take place in the hydrodynamical regime. Conclusions. Our results hint at an inside-out formation of planetesimals in the infant solar system because small planetesimals in the geometrical limit can filter dust much more efficiently close to the central star. However, even a fully-formed belt of planetesimals such as the MMSN only marginally captures inward-drifting dust and this seems to imply that dust in the protosolar disk has been filtered by planetesimals even smaller than 1 km (not included in this study) or that it has been assembled into planetesimals by other mechanisms (e.g., orderly growth, capture into vortexes). Further refinement of our work concerns, among other things: a quantitative description of the transition region between the hydro and settling regimes; an assessment of the role of disk turbulence for collisions, in particular in the hydro regime; and the coupling of our model to a planetesimal formation model."

We first show that starting from the present-day location of GJ 436b inevitably leads to damping the Kozai oscillations and to rapidly circularizing the planet. Conversely, starting from 5-10 times further away allows the onset of Kozai cycles. The tides act in peak eccentricity phases and reduce the semi-major axis of the planet. The net result is an evolution characterized by two phases: a first one with Kozai cycles and a slowly shrinking semi-major axis, and a second one once the planet gets out of the Kozai resonance characterized by a more rapid decrease. The timescale of this process appears in most cases much longer than the standard circularization time of the planet by a factor larger than 50. This model can provide a solution to the eccentricity paradox of GJ 436b. Depending on the various orbital configurations, it can take several Gyrs to GJ 436b to achieve a full orbital decrease and circularization. According to this scenario, we could be witnessing today the second phase of the scenario where the semi-major axis is already reduced while the eccentricity is still significant. We then explore the parameter space and derive in which conditions this model can be realistic given the age of the system. This yields constraints on the characteristics of the putative companion."

We are therefore consider using a more realistic breast anatomy by including skin, muscles, and suspensory ligaments. The breast tissues are modeled as neo-Hookean materials. A physical correct modeling of the breast requires the knowledge of the stress-free breast configuration. Here, this undeformed shape (i.e., without any residual stress) is computed using the prediction--correction iterative scheme proposed by Eiben et al. (Ann of Biomed Eng 44:154--173, 2016). The unloading procedure uses the breast configuration in prone and supine position in order to find a unique displacement vector field induced by gravitational forces. The 3D breast geometry is reconstructed from MRI images that are segmented (Yushkevich et al. in Neuroimage 31:1116--1128, 2006) to differentiate the four main tissue types. The breast volume is discretized with a hexa-dominant FE meshing tool as a unique volume. Finally, the model is evaluated by comparing the estimated breast deformations under gravity load with the experimental ones measured in three body positions: prone, supine, and oblique supine."

The overall behavior of the disk evolution is similar, except for weakening in various measures of GI activity by about at most tens of percent for the indirect potential case. Overall conclusions about disk evolution in earlier papers by our group, where the star was always assumed to be fixed in an inertial frame, remain valid. There is no evidence for independent one-armed instabilities, like SLING, in either simulation. On the other hand, the stellar motion about the system center of mass (COM) in the simulation with the indirect potential is substantial, up to 0.25 AU during the burst phase, as GIs initiate, and averaging about 0.9 AU during the asymptotic phase, when the GIs reach an overall balance of heating and cooling. These motions appear to be a stellar response to nonlinear interactions between discrete global spiral modes in both the burst and asymptotic phases of the evolution, and the star's orbital motion about the COM reflects the orbit periods of disk material near the corotation radii of the dominant spiral waves. This motion is, in principle, large enough to be observable and could be confused with stellar wobble due to the presence of one or more super-Jupiter mass protoplanets orbiting at 10's AU. We discuss why the excursions in our simulation are so much larger than those seen in simulations by Rice et al. 2003a."

All state-based reactive concepts share a common change detection mechanism: they detect changes in the evaluation result of an expression. On the basis of the identified common change detection mechanism, we propose active expressions as a reusable primitive. By abstracting the tedious implementation details of change detection, active expressions can ease the implementation of reactive programming concepts. We evaluate the design of active expressions by re-implementing a number of existing state-based reactive concepts using them. The resulting implementations highlight the expressiveness of active expressions. Active expressions enable the separation of essential from non-essential parts when reasoning about reactive programming concepts. By using active expressions as a primitive for change detection, developers of reactive language constructs and runtime support can now focus on the design of how application programmers should be able to react to change. Ultimately, we would like active expressions to encourage experiments with novel reactive programming concepts and with that to yield a wider variety of them to explore."

I doubt the tear was over a grade 2 and surgery is rarely an option in that. The normal advice is once the bruising is down to move it \"to pain not through pain\" .

I would imagine he'd feel some degree of pain perfoming it. \nporkburp: I don't want to put words in Emmet's mouth but I think by \"unremarkable\" he's referring to the overall rehab strategy, not the application of it.\n\nKeeping active, scaling your training to pain tolerance, and lots of low-load movement of the affected tissues is pretty standard advice across the board. Nothing new there.\n\nIt is perhaps cool to you that Johnny's low-load movement happens to be planche work. But for someone like him (I believe life-long gymnast, correct me if I'm wrong), planche work is beginner stuff. I, a female of average strength, might rehab the same with regular plank holds and wall pushups, which are beginner stuff for me.\nhandstandguy: I think it was the juxtaposition of him struggling with basic pushups and in the next clip performing a straddle planche that got me. Those two exercises are magnitudes of difficulty apart from each other.\nporkburp: Indeed. It could be that the nature of this injury allowed him to continue performing many SAS movements but required him to scale back on the BAS. (I don't know - I'm not a doctor)\n\nThis also assumes that the video is even true. Remember, this is just another big advertisement for the business of the Ido Portal Method.

The code, already designed to take into account the impact of an external radiation field, is updated to treat self-irradiated shocks at intermediate ($30<V_S <100$ km s$^{-1}$) and high velocity ($V_S \\ge 100$ km s$^{-1}$) which emit ultraviolet (UV), extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), and X-ray photons. The couplings between the photons generated by the shock, the radiative precursor, and the shock structure are computed self-consistently using an exact radiative transfer algorithm for line emission. The resulting code is explored over a wide range of parameters ($0.1 \\le n_H \\le 2$ cm$^{-3}$, $10 \\le V_S \\le 500$ km s$^{-1}$, and $0.1 \\le B \\le 10$ $\\mu$G) that covers the typical conditions of the WNM in the solar neighborhood. Results. The explored physical conditions are prompt to the existence of a diversity of stationary magnetohydrodynamic solutions, including J-type, CJ-type, and C-type shocks. These shocks are found to naturally induce phase transition between the WNM and the CNM, provided that the postshock thermal pressure is larger than the maximum pressure of the WNM and that the maximum density allowed by magnetic compression is larger than the minimum density of the CNM. The input flux of mechanical energy is primarily reprocessed into line emissions from the X-ray to the submillimeter domain. Intermediate and high velocity shocks are found to generate a UV radiation field that scales as $V_S^3$ for $V_S < 100$ km s$^{-1}$ and as $V_S^2$ at higher velocities, and an X-ray radiation field that scales as $V_S^3$ for $V_S \\ge 100$ km s$^{-1}$. Both radiation fields may extend over large distances in the preshock depending of the density of the surrounding medium and the hardness of the X-ray field which is solely driven by the shock velocity. Conclusions. This first paper presents the thermochemical trajectories of shocks in the WNM and their associated spectra. It corresponds to a new milestone in the development of the Paris-Durham shock code and a stepping stone for the analysis of observations that will be carried out in forthcoming works."

In the extreme case, when Lasso perfectly selects the \"true\" model, the OLS post-Lasso estimator becomes the oracle estimator. An important ingredient in our analysis is a new sparsity bound on the dimension of the model selected by Lasso, which guarantees that this dimension is at most of the same order as the dimension of the \"true\" model. Our rate results are nonasymptotic and hold in both parametric and nonparametric models. Moreover, our analysis is not limited to the Lasso estimator acting as a selector in the first step, but also applies to any other estimator, for example, various forms of thresholded Lasso, with good rates and good sparsity properties. Our analysis covers both traditional thresholding and a new practical, data-driven thresholding scheme that induces additional sparsity subject to maintaining a certain goodness of fit. The latter scheme has theoretical guarantees similar to those of Lasso or OLS post-Lasso, but it dominates those procedures as well as traditional thresholding in a wide variety of experiments."

Inactive intervals cannot incorporate their neighbors and can increase their length only if they are incorporated by active neighbors. The activity ranges are such that after a merging step the newly produced interval always becomes inactive for that epoch but active for some future epoch. Without making any mean-field assumption we show that: (i) if the initial distribution describes a renewal process, then such a property is preserved at all later times and all future epochs; (ii) the distribution of certain rescaled variables, for example, the domain length, has a well-defined and universal limiting behavior as $n\\to \\infty$ independent of the details of the process (merging rates, activity ranges$,...$). This last result explains the universality in the limiting behavior of several very different physical systems (e.g., the East model of glassy dynamics or the Paste-all model) which was observed in several simulations and analyzed in many physics papers. The main idea to obtain the asymptotic result is to first write down a recursive set of nonlinear identities for the Laplace transforms of the relevant quantities on different epochs and then to solve it by means of a transformation which in some sense linearizes the system."

We show that the contact quality can be preserved by including an additional ex-situ RTA step prior to the in-situ heating. The in-situ observations also show in real-time how the exchange reaction initiates simultaneously from several locations underneath the Al contact pad, and the Al crystal grows gradually inside the initial Ge NW with the growth interface along a Ge(111) lattice plane. Once the reaction front moves out from underneath the contact metal, two factors jeopardize an atomically accurate control of the Al/Ge reaction interface. We observed a local acceleration of the reaction interface due to the electron beam irradiation in the transmission electron microscope as well as the appearance of large jumps of the interface in unpassivated Ge wires while a smooth advancement of the reaction interface was observed in wires with an Al2O3 protecting shell on the surface. Carefully controlling all aspects of the exchange reaction, we demonstrate a fabrication process combining ex-situ and in-situ heating techniques to precisely control and produce axial Al/Ge/Al NW heterostructures with an ultra-short Ge segment down to 8 nanometers. Practically, the scaling down of Ge segment length is only limited by the microscope resolution."

Ive been on the routine for almost half a year now and I'm up to 60% bodyweight max dip and around 30% bodyweight added for 6 reps on pull-up to give a rough idea \npumpasaurus: You can't really base it on strength - it's mainly how your progress has been, and what your goals are. \n\nBasically, if you are still getting results, then you have the luxury of being able to choose whatever training structure you want. A full-body routine is the most time-efficient and usually involves the least amount of total work.\n\nIf you stall out and stop making any progress, and you're not feeling totally beat up (deload necessary), then the culprit is not doing enough work. Adding work might still allow a full-body routine, but the more work you do, the more sense it makes to split up the workouts so that you can focus and put the work in without having super long sessions.\nWolfeyRages: I'm able to progress strength wise, it just only seems to work with low reps high intensity \npumpasaurus: That's a good place to be.\n\nIf higher volume doesn't work for you, there's two reasons why: first, it's always less direct to train max strength in any way other than just directly progressing your intensity with higher weights (what you're doing), and as long as you can do it, you should - second, if you never do higher volume, your work capacity is probably fairly low, so you'd need to get used to higher volume in the first place for it to work.\n\nEventually the low-reps-high-intensity approach will stall out (unless you're a freak with great potential and you kind of achieve all your goals before it becomes necessary to mess with periodization and volume manipulation, which does happen), and it will require just adding extra work in order to have the body recognize that there's something happening that requires it to adapt.\nWolfeyRages: I definitely have low muscular endurance, I can't do more than 8 unweighted pull-ups which I will focus on for hypertrophy when the time comes, but for now I will take advantage of the low rep, hopefully it doesn't stall out before I achieve a few goals, but if it does atleast I know what I need to do, thanks \n"

So from what I read in the article, she did in fact consent to anything up to and including her own death by gunshot, stabbing, strangulation, or whatever else.\n\nA person could argue that if someone had successfully completed a sexual act with her that it wasn't \"technically\" rape, but doesn't the thought of that disturb you in the least?  The whole point of this experiment was to expose the darker impulses of humanity and considering how she was stripped naked, drawn on, cut, and other arguably horrible acts, it arguably succeeded.\n\nI'd say that if someone did in fact perform a sexual act on her using the argument she had \"consented\" to it happening it says a lot more about the person performing the act than it did about any sort of \"permission\" she may have \"granted\" the person doing it.\n\nIf a person had in fact done so that day, and then told people afterwards \"yes I had consensual sex with a woman who was unable to resist\" I'm pretty sure most people would call that rape.  Even though on purely technical grounds she \"consented\" to the act.\nidm: I don't see sex as inherently evil, or aggressive, or violent. So in my mind, if a woman of sound mind walked up to me and said \"here is my body, do with it as you please\", and I was single, the first thing on my mind would be sex. The attempted sex act would include positive touch to bring pleasure to the other party. That doesn't sound like rape to me. \n\nI'd like to know why you believe the implication of that is \"the darker impulses of Humanity\".

That's kinda shitty if that's the case\nZippyTheRobin: Comment you replied to described a \"rent controlled\" apartment, meaning the landlord can only raise the rent on a tenant at a specified, regulated rate (to prevent residents being forced out of their homes by rising rents in hypercompetitive markets such as the SF bay area). The commenter's brother offered to leave the apartment (giving up his legally given rent controlled status in exchange for the landlord buying him out) so the landlord could rent it out at current market rates.\naethelmund: AH that makes more sense now, I get it. Basically both parties knew that the place could be rented for more but the landlord couldn't charge him the market rate cause of rent control so the tenet and landlord agreed to a buy out, that's kinda cool actually, instead of having a shitty landlord and/or tenet they worked things out appropriately\n"

This paper attempts to help reconcile the gap between approaches to uncertainty and the needs of many AI systems by examining the control issues which arise, independent of a particular uncertainty calculus. when one tries to satisfy these needs. Truth Maintenance Systems have been used extensively in problem solving tasks to help organize a set of facts and detect inconsistencies in the believed state of the world. These systems maintain a set of true/false propositions and their associated dependencies. However, situations often arise in which we are unsure of certain facts or in which the conclusions we can draw from available information are somewhat uncertain. The non-monotonic TMS 12] was an attempt at reasoning when all the facts are not known, but it fails to take into account degrees of belief and how available evidence can combine to strengthen a particular belief. This paper addresses the problem of probabilistic reasoning as it applies to Truth Maintenance Systems. It describes a belief Maintenance System that manages a current set of beliefs in much the same way that a TMS manages a set of true/false propositions. If the system knows that belief in fact is dependent in some way upon belief in fact2, then it automatically modifies its belief in facts when new information causes a change in belief of fact2. It models the behavior of a TMS, replacing its 3-valued logic (true, false, unknown) with an infinite valued logic, in such a way as to reduce to a standard TMS if all statements are given in absolute true/false terms. Belief Maintenance Systems can, therefore, be thought of as a generalization of Truth Maintenance Systems, whose possible reasoning tasks are a superset of those for a TMS."

For instance, if you came across a sleeping homeless man, you had a method to kill him painlessly and take his money, and you knew with certainty that nobody would care about or notice his death, would it be ethical to kill him?  (Obviously, this involves a lot of simplifications that don't apply in real life.)\n[deleted]: &gt; would it be ethical to kill him?\n\nI suppose we're having a mature discussion here so I'm going to answer honestly. Simply put, yes. But then again, that's according to MY definition of 'ethics' as I stated in the earlier comment.\n\nAs long as the procedure is done in a peaceful and painless manner, I really can't see how that would be a bad thing. It may help if I clarify that I'm an atheist who doesn't believe in afterlife, so to me death isn't anything gruesome.\nTinac4: Fair enough!  I think that the scenario you described would be bad, but only on the basis of my own ethical intuitions, and those intuitions definitely aren't universal.\n"

The latter is a highly modular approach to semantics ensuring the separation of concerns between local statement evaluation and scheduling decisions. The new knowledge contributed by our work is threefold: first, we show that a new fairness notion, called quiescent fairness, is needed to characterize fairness adequately in the context of cooperative scheduling; second, we define a provably fair scheduler for cooperative scheduling languages; third, a qualitative comparison between the SOS and LAGC versions yields that the latter, while taking higher initial effort, is more amenable to proving fairness and scales better under language extensions than SOS. The grounding of our work is a detailed formal proof of quiescent fairness for the scheduler defined in LAGC semantics. The importance of our work is that it provides a formal foundation for the implementation of fair schedulers for cooperative scheduling languages, an increasingly popular paradigm (for example: akka/Scala, JavaScript, async Rust). Being based solely on semantics, our ideas are widely applicable. Further, our work makes clear that the standard notion of fairness in concurrent languages needs to be adapted for cooperative scheduling and, more generally, for any language that combines atomic execution sequences with some form of preemption."

A good agreement was obtained between numerical stabilized traction-compression cycle curves (with and without pre-straining) and experimental ones. This 3 dimensional simulation gave access to the evolution of the axial and tangential internal stresses and local strains during the tests. Numerical results showed: a decreasing of the tangential stress and stabilization after 40 cycles, whereas the axial stress showed weaker decreasing with the number of cycles. The results also pointed out a ratcheting and a slightly non proportional loading at the inner surface. The computed mean stress and strain values of the stabilized cycle being far from the initial ones, they could be used to get the safety margins of standard design related to fatigue, as well as to get accurate loading conditions needed for the use of more advanced fatigue analysis and criteria."

The majority were population-based models (n = 26), followed by individual-based models (n = 15) and a few metapopulation models (n = 4). Estimated values for the transmission rate varied substantially according to epidemiological settings, virus subtypes and epidemiological units. Other parameters such as the durations of the latent and infectious periods were more frequently assumed, limiting the insights brought by mechanistic models on these. Concerning control strategies, many models evaluated culling (n = 15), while vaccination received less attention (n = 7). According to the reviewed articles, optimal control strategies varied between virus subtypes and local conditions, and also depended on the objective. For instance, vaccination was optimal when the objective was to limit the overall number of culled flocks, while pre-emptive culling was preferred for reducing the epidemic size and duration. Earlier implementation of interventions consistently improved the efficacy of control strategies, highlighting the need for effective surveillance and epidemic preparedness. Potential improvements of mechanistic models include explicitly accounting for various transmission routes, and distinguishing poultry populations according to species and farm type. To provide insights to policy makers in a timely manner, aspects about the evaluation of control strategies that could deserve further attention include: economic evaluation, combination of strategies including vaccination, the use of optimization algorithm instead of comparing a limited set of scenarios, and real-time evaluation."

Additionally, for even values of $d$, we show that a subclass of Schnyder decompositions, which are called even, enjoy additional properties that yield a reduced formulation; in the case d=4, these correspond to well-studied structures on simple quadrangulations (2-orientations and partitions into 2 spanning trees). In the case d=4, the dual of even Schnyder decompositions yields (planar) orthogonal and straight-line drawing algorithms. For a 4-regular plane graph $G$ of mincut 4 with $n$ vertices plus a marked vertex $v$, the vertices of $G\\backslash v$ are placed on a $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ grid according to a permutation pattern, and in the orthogonal drawing each of the $2n-2$ edges of $G\\backslash v$ has exactly one bend.

The council even had power to move the college away from Oxford (subject to the consent of the Visitor, the Archbishop of Canterbury) if it transpired that Oxford was not a suitable home.\nIn total, 54 men served on the council, 11 of whom were college alumni; in 1903, Arthur Winnington-Ingram (Bishop of London) became the first former Keble student to join the council. Appointment was for life or until resignation rather than for a fixed term; the council had power to fill vacancies. The first members were drawn from the committee of the Keble Memorial Fund whose work had raised the money to build the college.  The council met three times per year, including a meeting on St Mark's Day (25 April) \u2013 this was not only John Keble's birthday but the date on which the foundation stone was laid in 1868, and so was adopted by the college for commemorations and celebrations.\nMost of the members of the council came from outside the college, and many did not have other continuing links with the university. It has been described as \"an external Council of ecclesiastical worthies\".  There were often arguments during meetings about the future direction of the college when Edward Stuart Talbot was Warden (from the college's foundation until 1888). Over time, the Tutors came to have a greater influence on the direction of the college, a change recognised in 1930 when the council ceded control of internal administration and academic matters to the Warden and Fellows (as the Tutors were then retitled).  It retained management of finances and ecclesiastical patronage, until Harry Carpenter (Warden from 1939 to 1955) persuaded the council to transfer its remaining powers to the Warden and Fellows. This placed the college \"on a constitutional par with the older colleges of the University.\" The council ceased to exist after 9 April 1952, the date on which new statutes of the college that placed full management in the hands of the Warden and Fellows were approved by the Queen in Council."

This approach allows the analytical treatment of economic models with an arbitrary number of agents, while preserving the system's interactions and complexity at the individual level. Our results show that the dynamics of capital accumulation and agents' position in the exchange space are correlated. Interactions in the exchange space induce several phases of the system. A first phase appears when attractive forces are limited. In this phase, an initial central position in the exchange space favors capital accumulation in average and leads to a higher level of capital, while agents far from the center will experience a slower accumulation process. A high level of initial capital drives agents towards a central position, i.e. improve the terms of their exchanges: they experience a higher demand and higher prices for their product. As usual, high capital productivity favors capital accumulation, while higher rates of capital depreciation reduce capital stock. In a second phase, attractive forces are predominant. The previous results remain, but an additional threshold effect appears. Even though no restriction was imposed initially on the system, two types of agents emerge, depending on their initial stock of capital. One type of agents will remain above the capital threshold and occupy and benefit from a central position. The other type will remain below the threshold, will not be able to break it and will remain at the periphery of the exchange space. In this phase, capital distribution is less homogenous than in the first phase."

This and other structures turn the symmetry algebra \\cA_m into a ribbon Hopf algebra, and we show that this is ``Morita equivalent'' to the quantum group U_q(sl_2) for m=q+q^{-1}. The open-chain results are extended to the cases |m|< 2 for which the algebras are no longer semisimple; these possess continuum limits that are critical (conformal) field theories, or massive perturbations thereof. Such models, for open and closed boundary conditions, arise in connection with disordered fermions, percolation, and polymers (self-avoiding walks), and certain non-linear sigma models, all in two dimensions. A product operation is defined in a related way for the Temperley-Lieb representations also, and the fusion rules for this are related to those for A_m or U_q(sl_2) representations; this is useful for the continuum limits also, as we discuss in a companion paper."

The war, according to the Burmese, began in January 1547 when Siamese forces conquered the frontier town of Tavoy (Dawei). Later in the year, the Burmese forces led by Gen. Saw Lagun Ein retook the Upper Tenasserim coast down to Tavoy. Next year, in October 1548, three Burmese armies led by King Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung invaded Siam through the Three Pagodas Pass. The Burmese forces penetrated up to the capital city of Ayutthaya but could not take the heavily fortified city. One month into the siege, Siamese counterattacks broke the siege, and drove back the invasion force. But the Burmese negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the return of two important Siamese nobles (the heir apparent Prince Ramesuan, and Prince Thammaracha of Phitsanulok) whom they had captured.\nThe successful defense preserved Siamese independence for 15 years. Still, the war was not decisive. The next Burmese invasion in 1563 would force a Siamese surrender in February 1564, and make Ayutthaya a vassal state of Burma for the first time."

        "text": " putative Majorana mode features, indicating the probable absence of a topological phase, and the current paper suggests specific experimentally accessible measures for a careful quantitative analysis of the measured ZBCP stability. In this paper, we study how the counter-intuitive robustness of the ZBCP height to the tunnel barrier strength can be used to distinguish Majorana modes from non-topological ZBCPs. To this end, we introduce a dimensionless quality factor $F$ to quantify the robustness of the ZBCP height based on the range of normal-state (i.e. above-gap) conductance (which depends crucially on the tunnel barrier height) over which the ZBCP height remains within a pre-specified range of quantization. By computing this quality factor $F$ together with the topological characteristics for a wide range of models and parameters, we find that Majoranas are significantly more robust (i.e., have a higher value of $F$) compared with non-topological ZBCPs in the ideal low-temperature limit. Even at a temperature as high as the experimentally used $20$ mK, we find that we can set a threshold value of $F\\sim 2.5$ (for $\\epsilon=0.1$) so that ZBCPs associated with a quality factor $F>2.5$ are likely topological and $F\\ll 2.5$ are topologically trivial. More precisely, the value of $F$ is operationally related to the degree of separation of the Majorana modes in the system, although $F$ uses only the experimentally measured tunnel conductance properties. Finally, we discuss how the quality factor $F$ measured in a transport setup can help estimate the quality of topological qubits made from Majorana modes. In particular, we show that if the induced gap can be enhanced somehow beyond the currently available $\\sim 30$ $\\mu$eV in InAs/Al samples, large (small) values of $F$ could easily distinguish between stable topological (unstable trivial) ZBCPs with the quantum dot induced quasi-Majorana bound states occasionally behaving similar to topological Majorana modes in short wires."

How many riots have there been in the last 10 years let alone 20 years here in my town? Absolutely none. They don't need 4 tents at 20 thousand a piece. Fuck off. \nSquirrel009: How many riots do you think Ferguson Missouri had before they had to call in the national guard to use grenade launchers and set up tents to stop looters from destroying the town? \nI_AM_HYLIAN: Exactly, call in the national guard. The only people who should have access to those types of weapons. \nSquirrel009: yeah the people who had their livelihoods burned down and or looted can wait a couple days,  it's selfish of them to ask for a rapid response. It's not like police being able to stop the riot from destroying their businesses sooner would have helped. \nI_AM_HYLIAN: They had all the available equipment and the riots went on for a few weeks. Looting, all that jazz. Half the people weren't even from Ferguson. \nSquirrel009: I don't see how it is relevent where anyone came from or how long it lasted.  My point is quit crying about what tools the police use when you clearly have no idea what you are talking about. \nI_AM_HYLIAN: We have a police force, and we have a military. Both require specific training to use certain weapons. Our police force is becoming more militarized without proper military training \nSquirrel009: I didn't realize you knew all the training your officers had been through and therefore confirmed they aren't trained in the equipment. I was operating under the assumption you had no idea what they had been trained for. How did you find that out?\nI_AM_HYLIAN: There's no way the academy is anything like military training. Do you agree? \nSquirrel009: I hear some actually are, but I don't think that is common practice. I don't actually know first hand though. They go through more training than just academy. Some, if not all, states legally require x amount of training hours per year to be a police officer. They also go to training and get certifications in all kinds of things before they join any kind of special teams like mobile field force (aka riot squad)\nI_AM_HYLIAN: The media has been bashing police offices all together. It's not a good time to be a white cop at the moment. They are well equipped, but ill trained with the weapons at hand. I know people in the force. My buddy has probably shot a rifle once while in his uniform since he was sworn in. Going on 6 years he's never fired a grenade launcher, nor a rifle. Military men and women deal with those sorts of weapons day in and day out. They are properly trained. Cops may be given a certificate stating that they are trained to shoot a rifle, but do they put it in to practice everyday? I'm sorry but they don't. \nSquirrel009: Just because your friend doesn't practice with his rifle that means all officers are inadequately trained? \nI_AM_HYLIAN: True, but he's been in the force long enough to know not everyone doest because like you said it's not common practice. \n"

A generalization of Prony's approach to multivariate decomposition problems is presented , exploiting eigenvector methods for solving polynomial equations. We show how to compute the frequencies and weights of a minimal polynomial-exponential decomposition , using the first coefficients of the series. A key ingredient of the approach is the flat extension criteria, which leads to a multivariate generalization of a rank condition for a Carath{\\'e}odory-Fej{\\'e}r decomposition of multivariate Hankel matrices. A new algorithm is given to compute a basis of the Artinian Gorenstein algebra, based on a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process and to decompose polynomial-exponential series. A general framework for the applications of this approach is described and illustrated in different problems. We provide Kronecker-type theorems for convolution operators, showing that a convolution operator (or a cross-correlation operator) is of finite rank, if and only if, its symbol is a polynomial-exponential function, and we relate its rank to the decomposition of its symbol. We also present Kronecker-type theorems for the reconstruction of measures as weighted sums of Dirac measures from moments and for the decomposition of polynomial-exponential functions from values. Finally, we describe an application of this method for the sparse interpolation of polylog functions from values."

        "text": " foam seems very messy.\n\nAdvice??\n5degreenegativerake: The tried and true method is to staple rafter vent to the roof deck in every rafter space and then cover with fiber batts. This allows air to flow from your vented soffit to your (should be vented) ridge, allowing any moisture on your roof deck to be carried away.\n\nOnce you get into spray foam, you will have a huge pissing match between the old school guys and the new school guys. Cathedral ceilings are notorious for mold at the peak. Any tiny little air leak in the insulation will allow warm moist air to hit the cold roof deck and condense, leading to eventual rot and roof failure. It can be done right on an unvented roof but it MUST be done right or it will fail. I personally have a cathedral ceiling I insulated myself with rigid foam board, urethane sealant and spray can foam.\n\nIf you want to go this route, look up \u201cbuilding science\u201d and follow their guidelines to the letter. You have to have perfect air sealing, your air seal needs to be in the right place and you have to do a meticulous job. You WILL get mold if you have any air leaks at all, like a single outlet box that is not entirely encapsulated with sealant.\nrandolph51: Ok let\u2019s talk about a few things.The moisture occurs when warm air from inside hits the cold air under the shingles, or coming in through any small air leak in the roof. Then condensation forms, and gathers against the rafters or the roof sheathing. \n\nand the venting is  supposed to take any moisture up and out of the ridge vent, so as not to sit on the insulation, drywall, or underside of the plywood.\n\nSo the foam should totally encapsulate all wood surfaces, and fill all voids in the system so warm air NEVER hits the cold rafters or plywood, and therefore never condenses, and therefore no moisture gathers, and a venting system is moot. \n\nThere is no ridge vent, I would have to make one. There is no gable vent, and the peak is too low to make a plenum anyway. \nThe garage below is currently unheated. The loft is  going to get a heatpump hvac. \n\nSo if I totally encapsulte the roof, add sheetrock, It should act as one solid member, and moisture managment is unecessary.  \n\nIs that correct??\n\nOne more thing- Is the airflow in a vented roof system supposed to help draw away hot air in The summer? Does the 1inch airspace under the shingles help cool the space below?\n\n\nAnd if done \u201cright\u201d i can accomplish a total seal with: rigid foam board 2-3\u201d, construction adhesive, cans of spray foam?  \nOR just suck it up and hire a foam guy??\n5degreenegativerake: Yes, your understanding on all is correct. As is often the case, the devil is in the details. If done 100% correct you will have no issues. I got a steal of a deal on 2\u201d foil faced polyiso so I went with that. I think professional spray foam is still superior, but my project was like $40k for spray foam or $7k on the foam board. You are trading shitloads of labor for some dollars. On a smaller project I would definitely pay the pros, and it needs to be closed cell.\nrandolph51: I got it. Thanks for the words.\n"

Chronic noise exposure has been associated with sleep disturbances and increased incidence of diabetes. Adverse cardiovascular effects occur from chronic exposure to noise due to the sympathetic nervous system's inability to habituate. The sympathetic nervous system maintains lighter stages of sleep when the body is exposed to noise, which does not allow blood pressure to follow the normal rise and fall cycle of an undisturbed circadian rhythm.\nStress from time spent around elevated noise levels has been linked with increased workplace accident rates, aggression, and other anti-social behaviors. The most significant sources are vehicles, aircraft, prolonged exposure to loud music, and industrial noise.
