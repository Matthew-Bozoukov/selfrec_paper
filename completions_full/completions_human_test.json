We employ this model to simulate signal propagation and ionic electrodiffusion across a dendritic arbor. Using these simulation results, we then designed an algorithm to detect synapses from Ca2+ imaging datasets. We finally apply this algorithm to experimental Ca2+-indicator datasets from neurons expressing jGCaMP7s (Dana et al., 2019), using full-dendritic arbor sampling in vivo in the Xenopus laevis optic tectum using fast random-access two-photon microscopy.Our model reproduces the dynamics of visual stimulus-evoked jGCaMP7s-mediated calcium signals observed experimentally, and the resulting algorithm allows prediction of the location of synapses across the dendritic arbor.Our study provides a way to predict synaptic activity and location on dendritic arbors, from fluorescence data in the full dendritic arbor of a neuron recorded in the intact and awake developing vertebrate brain."

In Section 4, we study thick disk models which are of low angular momentum but still have no significant radial motion. The accretion rates could be very high causing the flow to become radiation dominated and the disk to be geometrically thick. For low accretion rates, ion pressure supported disks are formed. In Section 5, we extensively discuss the properties of transonic flows which has with sub-Keplerian angular momentum. In the absence of shock discontinuities, these sub-Keplerian flows are basically advecting, similar to Bondi flows, close to the black holes, though far away they match Keplerian or sub-Keplerian disks. In presence of shocks, the post-shock flow becomes rotation dominated similar to thick disks. In Section 6, we present results of important numerical simulations of accretion flows. Significant results from the studies of evolution of viscous transonic flows are reported. In Section 7, we discuss some observational evidences of the black hole accretion. We also present a detailed model of a generalized accretion disk and present its spectra and compare with observations. In Section 8, we summarize the review and make concluding remarks."

Together, these theorems allow us to define a measure-preserving set of \"action-angle\" coordinates on the space of closed equilateral polygons. The new coordinate system allows us to make explicit computations of exact expectations for total curvature and for some chord lengths of closed (and confined) equilateral random walks, to give statistical criteria for sampling algorithms on the space of polygons and to prove that the probability that a randomly chosen equilateral hexagon is unknotted is at least $\\frac{1}{2}$. We then use our methods to construct a new Markov chain sampling algorithm for equilateral closed polygons, with a simple modification to sample (rooted) confined equilateral closed polygons. We prove rigorously that our algorithm converges geometrically to the standard measure on the space of closed random walks, give a theory of error estimators for Markov chain Monte Carlo integration using our method and analyze the performance of our method. Our methods also apply to open random walks in certain types of confinement, and in general to walks with arbitrary (fixed) edgelengths as well as equilateral walks."

From the numerical simulations, we place constraints on the precision with which one can measure the 3D dispersion depending on the turbulence sonic Mach number. We show that no universal correspondence between the 3D velocity dispersions measured in the turbulent volume and minima of the 2D velocity dispersions available through observations exist. For instance, for subsonic turbulence the correspondence is poor at scales much smaller than the turbulence injection scale, while for supersonic turbulence the correspondence is poor for the scales comparable with the injection scale. We provide a physical explanation of the existence of such a 2D-3D correspondence and discuss the uncertainties in evaluating the damping scale of ions that can be obtained from observations. However, we show that the statistics of velocity dispersion from observed line profiles can provide the spectral index and the energy transfer rate of turbulence. Also, comparing two similar simulations with different viscous coefficients it was possible to constrain the turbulent cut-off scale. This may especially prove useful since it is believed that ambipolar diffusion may be one of the dominant dissipative mechanism in star-forming regions. In this case, the determination of the ambipolar diffusion scale may be used as a complementary method for the determination of magnetic field intensity in collapsing cores. We discuss the implications of our findings in terms of a new approach to magnetic field measurement proposed by Li & Houde (2008)."

People do not make home cooked meals as often anymore. Modern society \"doesn't have time\" - really doesn't make time - for that.\n\nI managed to get through med school and an Internal Medicine residency and had enough time to eat healthy. You can grill a chicken breast with lemon pepper seasoning in 10 minutes, while you microwave the veggies with a small amount of water to steam them. After that is done you can toss a decent salad in 15 minutes. That's a quality meal in less than half an hour. You have to make time. Plus, the items I listed can be cooked in larger batches on the weekend to make multiple, ready to eat meals. Ultimately, even if you have to rely on less healthy, processed foods, having good portion control will prevent morbid obesity. \nZorbick: I get what you're saying, but that is still more effort than a microwave dinner. And you will have more dishes afterward to clean. It's not impossible to eat healthy while being busy, it's just not the easiest so it doesn't happen as often.\nGreyDeath: People managed to do so in the past, when microwaves were not an option. And like I said, beyond that, even if cooking your own meals were not an option, limiting caloric intake to not be greater than your total daily expenditure is always an option. \npalebluedott: It's just not that simple, if it were the obesity epidemic would be falling not rising.\nGreyDeath: I know it's not simple, which is why I think boiling it down to just price is not accurate either. [Compared to other developed countries](http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/01/america-food-spending-less) the average US household spends less on food as a percentage of their budget, while at the same time we have a higher average income. Additionally, we now spend less compared to how much we spent 30 years ago. Food costs are at a near all time low, so I don't feel like healthy food being too expensive is the primary reason for the epidemic. Perhaps just the fact that unhealthy food is cheaper relative to healthy food is part of it, but then that boils to poor choices, meaning we should focus on education. \n\nYou pair that with a drastic decrease in physical activity due to multiple reasons (decrease in labor intensive jobs, increase in sedentary leisure activities like watching TV) and people are going to gain weight. But this is a complex behavioral problem that can't be boiled down to \"well people are too busy\" because its not true in other countries, nor was it true in our past. \npalebluedott: Well unfortunately here on reddit,  if you don't say exactly what you mean right out of the gate you're always inevitably bound to be drawn out so you can say it in depth.  Now I agree with you. It's a combo of medical, psychological, processed, convenience, and culture to be brief, but for some reason many folks never seem to acknowledge all of this,  it always comes down to \"just\" arguments, you know? \n"

Each team consisted of students from various universities around the globe and had expertise in multiple design domains. An MDAO study is presented that utilizes the AGILE toolchain to investigate the feasibility of implementing an auxiliary solar power system on a baseline aircraft. The steps performed are: (1) definition of a multidisciplinary design problem, (2) development of collaborative workflow and (3) optimization using surrogate models. Through the case study, a novel technology concept is investigated and the efficacy of the AGILE toolchain in facilitating a MDAO is analyzed."

Two types of interaction are now considered within the financial sector: financial agents can lend capital to, or choose to buy shares of, other financial firms. Capital now flows between financial agents and is only partly invested in real sectors, depending on their relative returns. We translate this framework into our formalism and study the diffusion of capital and possible defaults in the system, both at the macro and micro level.At the macro level, we find that several collective states may emerge, each characterized by a distinct level of average capital and investors per sector. These collective states depend on external parameters such as level of connections between investors or firms' productivity.The multiplicity of possible collective states is the consequence of the nature of the system composed of interconnected heterogeneous agents. Several equivalent patterns of returns and portfolio allocation may emerge. The multiple collective states induce the unstable nature of financial markets, and some of them include defaults may emerge. At the micro level, we study the propagation of returns and defaults within a given collective state. Our findings highlight the significant role of banks, which can either stabilize the system through lending activities or propagate instability through loans to investors."

For many close readers of Alexander, this discontinuity is startling and unexplained. When I finally read \"Notes\" in 2015, I was struck by the detailed worked example, along with a peculiar mathematical treatment of the method, and a hint that the modularization presented in the example was reckoned by a computer program he had written -- all in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Because of my fascination with metaheuristic optimization, I couldn't resist trying to replicate his experimental results. Computers and their programs relish dwelling on flaws in your thinking -- Alexander was not exempt. By engaging in hermeneutics and software archeology, I was able to uncover / discover the trajectory of his thinking as he encountered failures and setbacks with his computer programs. My attempted replication also failed, and that led me to try to unearth the five different programs he wrote, understand them, and figure out how one led to the next. They are not described in published papers, only in internal reports. My search for these reports led to their being made available on the Net. What I found in my voyage were the early parts of a chain of thought that started with cybernetics, mathematics, and a plain-spoken computer; passed through \"A City is Not a Tree\"; paused to \"make God appear in the middle of a field\"; and ended with this fundamental design goal: **I try to make the volume of the building so that it carries in it all feeling. To reach this feeling, I try to make the building so that it carries my eternal sadness. It comes, as nearly as I can in a building, to the point of tears.**"

This survey is followed by a detailed case-study of the simpler but potentially thematic problem of coupling Brownian motion together with its local time at $0$. This problem possesses its own intrinsic interest as well as being closely related to the BKR coupling construction. Attention focusses on a simple immersed (co-adapted) coupling, namely the reflection/synchronized coupling. It is shown that this coupling is optimal amongst all immersed couplings of Brownian motion together with its local time at $0$, in the sense of maximizing the coupling probability at all possible times, at least when not started at pairs of initial points lying in a certain singular set. However numerical evidence indicates that the coupling is not a maximal coupling, and is a simple but non-trivial instance for which this distinction occurs. It is shown how the reflection/synchronized coupling can be converted into a successful equi-filtration coupling, by modifying the coupling using a deterministic time-delay and then by concatenating an infinite sequence of such modified couplings. The construction of an explicit equi-filtration coupling of two copies of the BKR diffusion follows by a direct generalization, although the proof of success for the BKR coupling requires somewhat more analysis than in the local time case."

The weight range you've mentioned is an acceptable number. With lean bulking you might be gaining on the lower end though which is fine. \n\nCardio never hurts, keeps the heart healthy. You can try and do high intensity cardio. The deficit won't get too big. If you are weighing yourself each day, you'll see how much you are losing in a week.

We investigate efficient representation scheme and algorithms to bring the benefits of the consistency techniques to also high arity cost functions, which are often derived from hard global constraints from classical constraint satisfaction. The literature suggests some global cost functions can be represented as flow networks, and the minimum cost flow algorithm can be used to compute the minimum costs of such networks in polynomial time. We show that naive adoption of this flow-based algorithmic method for global cost functions can result in a stronger form of null-inverse consistency. We further show how the method can be modified to handle cost projections and extensions to maintain generalized versions of AC* and FDAC* for cost functions with more than two variables. Similar generalization for the stronger EDAC* is less straightforward. We reveal the oscillation problem when enforcing EDAC* on cost functions sharing more than one variable. To avoid oscillation, we propose a weak version of EDAC* and generalize it to weak EDGAC* for non-binary cost functions. Using various benchmarks involving the soft variants of hard global constraints ALLDIFFERENT, GCC, SAME, and REGULAR, empirical results demonstrate that our proposal gives improvements of up to an order of magnitude when compared with the traditional constraint optimization approach, both in terms of time and pruning."

As a particular example of this we present an instance of Braess' paradox in which adding new links to a network whose agents all use the ISPA results in a decrease in overall throughput. We also demonstrate that load-balancing, in which the agents' decisions are collectively made to optimize the global cost incurred by all traffic currently being routed, is suboptimal as far as global cost averaged across time is concerned. This is also due to 'side-effects', in this case of current routing decision on future traffic. The mathematics of Collective Intelligence (COIN) is concerned precisely with the issue of avoiding such deleterious side-effects in multi-agent systems, both over time and space. We present key concepts from that mathematics and use them to derive an algorithm whose ideal version should have better performance than that of having all agents use the ISPA, even in the infinitesimal limit. We present experiments verifying this, and also showing that a machine-learning-based version of this COIN algorithm in which costs are only imprecisely estimated via empirical means (a version potentially applicable in the real world) also outperforms the ISPA, despite having access to less information than does the ISPA.

Starting easy without forcing yourself too much. Then doing dynamics and continuing the stretching. \n\nWhat's the reason to NOT warm up with active &amp; dynamic stretches?\nbrawnkowsky: You are right.  The person above probably thought you were referring to passive stretching (ex: touching your toes and holding for a few seconds).  Active stretching should proceed all workouts if you intend on keeping it safe.  Active stretching includes jumping jacks, lunges without weight, straight leg marches, skips, etc.  It should not be strenuous or difficult, but it should get your heart rate going, get blood flowing through your muscles, and increase body temperature.\n\nAnother good way to remove muscle soreness is through something called myofascial release.  It is essentially a massage of your muscles; you can do it by using a foam roll or a PVC Pipe and rolling it down your muscles.  What it does is separate the muscle fibers in your muscles back to their normal differences.  After a workout, the fascia (outer coating) of the fibers can mesh together, inhibiting sliding filaments, which helps cause soreness.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam_rolling\n\nAnd finally, you can do a lactic acid drain.  After a good lower body workout or run, lay on the grown with your legs straight.  Put your feet about 4-6 inches above the ground (ex. Pushing against the wall) and lay there for 5-ish minutes.  Drains the lactic acid from your muscles, feels real good.  \n\nIf you still feel very sore after all workouts and all of these techniques, lower the volume of your workout for a week or two (download).  Do the same workouts with the same intensity, but do half of the sets/reps.\n\nGood luck\nalexispres: I thought the lactic acid build up was disproven?\nbrawnkowsky: I haven't heard this, source?\nalexispres: \"Lactic Acid is commonly thought to induce muscle failure or soreness, but has not been shown to be the causative factor.

But according to examine.com there is no evidence it causes soreness. It still occurs though. :)\nbrawnkowsky: You're right, lactic acid doesn't cause soreness.

An early portion of the data (\"period 1,\" with 14 events) was used by PAO to set an energy cut maximizing the anisotropy in period 1; the 69 measurements include this \"tuned\" subset, and subsequent \"untuned\" events with energies above the same cutoff. Also, measurement errors are approximately summarized. These factors are problematic for independent analyses of PAO data. Within the context of \"standard candle\" source models (i.e., with a common isotropic emission rate), and considering only the 55 untuned events, there is no significant evidence favoring association of UHECRs with local AGN vs. an isotropic background. The highest-probability associations are with the two nearest, adjacent AGN, Centaurus A and NGC 4945. If the association model is adopted, the fraction of UHECRs that may be associated is likely nonzero but is well below 50%. Our framework enables estimation of the angular scale for deflection of cosmic rays by cosmic magnetic fields; relatively modest scales of $\\approx\\!3^{\\circ}$ to $30^{\\circ}$ are favored. Models that assign a large fraction of UHECRs to a single nearby source (e.g., Centaurus A) are ruled out unless very large deflection scales are specified a priori, and even then they are disfavored. However, including the period 1 data alters the conclusions significantly, and a simulation study supports the idea that the period 1 data are anomalous, presumably due to the tuning. Accurate and optimal analysis of future data will likely require more complete disclosure of the data."

And obviously that isn't the case, your specific point that greenhouse gases are worse is suffice.\n\nBuses as a transportation method over cars would be a massive improvement but electric or natural gas powered buses would be even better than diesel. I wasn't trying to be pedantic, but rather for the sake of clarity make sure I wasn't missing some other information.\n\nEdit: admitting you've made a gaff is really hard, I never made an ad hominem attack or changed my core question.\nExcerptsAndCitations: Please don't strain your back pushing those goalposts\n"

Good luck, OP.\nShadomd: I completely understand! I figured it was worth a try to ask for help regardless. The table is $700 alone, I do have a friend who has certain tools and is willing to help me however he has only built bedframes and beehives from what I know. He hasn't built a table before but he offered to help regardless. Say if I had a table saw, router, drill press, and cut off saw would it make it easier to make?\nLittleJackass80: Absolutely. So let's say you don't really need to buy tools and you just have to get lumber and fasteners. My first step would be looking at what kind of wood I'd want and how I'm going to assemble the top. The other pieces, the legs, aprons, etc, you could use a wood that isn't as nice, but the top matters. This is especially challenging because you want to stain - which hides much less imperfection than paint, so the wood has to be nice to begin with.\n\nAssemble the top sounds like overkill, but you have to consider you won't find a slab of wood that size for a decent price, so you'll be joining some more narrow pieces together to form the wider top. (There are more tools involved here, however let's not consider them for now, let's just focus on the lumber.) Pine or Fir is going to be the cheapest and most available to you in big box stores. It also looks the cheapest and is soft and will easily pick up markings from writing on the table/pressing too hard. There are also more knots and imperfections in this type of wood. If you were going for a rustic or industrial look, I'd say go for it, but this is more finished looking to me.\n\nThis leaves us looking at nicer woods or high grade plywood with edge banding. You can find both of these options at big box stores, however the quality simply isn't what you'd find at a yard or specialty store. (Think lots of warping, wood that's been there for who knows how long, and a lack of knowledge from underpaid and under trained associates.) \n\nThe hardware, stain, sealer, and fasteners wouldn't be a terrible cost, probably around $50, but the lumber is going to sting. Figure out your plan - (btw, look on sites like Ana White for free plans that tells you how much of everything you need,) and take that list to the store and see what the cost is. Plan for waste, up your needed lumber, and see if you feel it's worth it. \n\n(Another option would be to find a table top on another old table and refinish it and just make the base. Craigslist, estate sales, thrift stores, etc.)\n"

Systems were generally easy to operate, however the various systems required substantially different levels of meteorological expertise on the part of their users--reflecting the various operational environments for which the systems had been designed. Systems varied in their statistical behavior, but on this difficult forecast problem, the systems generally showed a skill approximately equal to that of persistence forecasts and climatological (historical frequency) forecasts. The two systems that appeared best able to discriminate significant from non significant weather events were traditional expert systems. Both of these systems required the operator to make relatively sophisticated meteorological judgments. We are unable, based on only one summer's worth of data, to determine the extent to which the greater skill of the two systems was due to the content of their knowledge bases, or to the subjective judgments of the operator.

Cause I thought that was it.\n\nHow would 'actual' free will actually show up? The entire universe goes about reacting mindlessly, but as soon as you get some gray matter into the equation, the laws of physics are suspended? It seems like a big assumption to make based on a personal impression.\n\n[deleted]: Actually having free will isn't just thinking you have free will. The example I use in my class is this: If I was a jedi master and I used the force on one of my students and made him say \"I really enjoy this class and I have made this decision freely\". He clearly wouldn't actually have free will.\n\n'Actual' free will enters the equation if you posit something like an immaterial soul *or* if you change the definition of freedom like the compatibilists do. I don't like either of these options, hence I am a determinism.\nschawt: I dunno, there's a difference between being a slave to a jedi's will and being a slave to your own will. You are a slave to your own will, but that, to me, is the same as being free; doing what you want to do. If you're a slave to someone else, then it kinda transitions into actual slavery right?\n\n\n[deleted]: Well for one person, what's the difference between being a slave to the laws of physics and being a slave to the jedi's will? In both cases, you think that you have free will, but in both cases you're actually entirely under the control of something other than your will.\n[deleted]: In determinism is there really any such thing as a 'will'?\n[deleted]: Depends on what you mean by \"will\" obviously. If you're talking about an immaterial force that \"emerges\" from an agent, then no.\n[deleted]: Well I figured that. I was just wondering what you, as the determinist, meant by will (I'm also a determinist). Maybe you meant sort of a desire?\nnooneelse: I would add a couple of things to \"desire\" before calling it \"will\".  Things along the lines of \"intention to act\", maybe something about the \"mental action of trying\", though that second one is in more sketchy terms.\n\nBut it seems clear that \"desire\" and \"will\" come apart.  I can desire something without willing to have it at all.  Indeed, I might have to exercise strong \"willpower\" to overcome a desire.  That could be countered with founding that willpower on a separate desire.  Which just leads me to the point that desires can obviously contradict each other, and we still say that we have each of the desires that contradicts the others.  I don't think that kind of dynamic is ever said of the will.\n[deleted]: agreed. I don't know why I just mentioned 'desire'. I feel like a complete tool.

We use luminosities and temperatures to estimate the masses and ages of these stars using different models from different authors. Having estimated the luminosities of all our stars within 3kpc, in particular for all O- and early B-type stars, we have determined the median and mean luminosities for all spectral types for luminosity classes I, III, and V. Our luminosity values for super giants deviate from earlier results: Previous work generally overestimates distances and luminosities compared to our data, this is likely due to Hipparcos parallaxes (generally more accurate and larger than previous ground-based data) and the fact that many massive stars have recently been resolved into multiples of lower masses and luminosities. From luminosities and effective temperatures we derived masses and ages using mass tracks and isochrones from different authors. From masses and ages we estimated lifetimes and derived a lower limit for the supernova rate of ~20 events/Myr averaged over the next 10 Myrs within 600 pc from the sun. These data are then used to search for areas in the sky with higher likelihood for a supernova or gravitational wave event (like OB associations)."

        "text": " patterns between actors found in modern reactive distributed systems. Approach: We describe seven smart home automation scenarios (in which an actor represents every smart home appliance) to motivate the support by actor languages for five radically different types of message synchronization patterns, which are lacking in modern distributed actor-based languages. Fortunately, these five types of synchronisation patterns have been studied extensively by the Complex Event Processing (CEP) community. Our paper describes how such CEP patterns are elegantly added to an actor-based programming language. Knowledge: Based on our findings, we propose an extension of the single-message matching paradigm of contemporary actor-based languages in order to support a multiple-message matching way of thinking in the same way as proposed by CEP languages. Our proposal thus enriches the actor-model by ways of declaratively describing complex message combinations to which an actor can respond. Grounding: We base the problem-statement of the paper on an online poll in the home automation community that has motivated the real need for the CEP-based synchronisation operators between actors proposed in the paper. Furthermore, we implemented a DSL -- called Sparrow -- that supports said operators and we argue quantitatively (in terms of LOC and in terms of a reduction of the concerns that have to be handled by programmers) that the DSL outperforms existing approaches. Importance: This work aims to provide a set of synchronization operators that help actor-based languages to handle the complex interaction required by modern reactive distributed systems. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first one to add advanced CEP synchronization operators to the -- relatively simplistic single-message based matching -- mechanisms of most actor-based languages."

In more details, we first assume the ATOM model in which each Look-Compute-Move cycle execution is executed atomically, ie every robot that is activated at instant t instantaneously executes a full cycle between t and t+1. ATOM being strictly stronger than CORDA, all impossibility results in ATOM also hold in CORDA. We show that it is impossible to explore a grid of at least three nodes with less than three robots in ATOM. (This first result holds for both deterministic and probabilistic settings.) Next, we show that it is impossible to deterministically explore a (2,2)-Grid with less than 4 robots, and a (3,3)-Grid with less than 5 robots, respectively. Then, we propose deterministic algorithms in CORDA to exhibit the optimal number of robots allowing to explore of a given grid. Our results show that except in two particular cases, 3 robots are necessary and sufficient to deterministically explore a grid of at least three nodes. The optimal number of robots for the two remaining cases is: 4 for the (2,2)-Grid and 5 for the (3,3)-Grid."

My max regular push ups are about 30. What's the best way to train for one arm? Negatives/knee OAPU's/archer push ups/uneven? How to include them in RR? What rep ranges should I use?\ntykato: I've never trained for the OAPU specifically, yet can do it. Here's how:\n\nI did the basic pattern (normal push up with good form) with added weight. I did 5x5 every other day with focus on good form. Every week, i increased the weight by about 2.5kg/5lbs.\n\nAfter adding about +30% bodyweight, i could do archers, and at about +60% bodyweight, i could do my first one arm.\n\nA good way to add the weight could be a weight vest, books/stuff in a backpack, or even just another person that would push you down slightly (though the resistence is hard to track).\n\nThere are plenty of other ways to achieve the OAPU. This is just my own way, which worked for me.\nPewoos: Thanks for the advice. Btw, how did you add +60% bw? I don't see myself putting 40 kg in a backpack lol. \ntykato: You're welcome! After a certain weight, just use people. In the beginning, let them lean on your shoulders (weight their lean with a scale) - then they gradually increase the lean - and finally they just sit on your shoulders.\n"

If not then they're not being forced are they?\nThroawaymay20: Okkk. Maybe  shouldn't have used to the words Black people without a qualifier that this will mostly apply to 26.2% of all African American persons who live in poverty and also face the full whammy of institutional racism with the rest of the black people.\n\nAll black people don't live im universal conditions of a defined institutional racism..That s not life.

Institutional racism affects individual blacks in different ways.\n[deleted]: &gt; that this will mostly apply to 26.2% of all African American persons who live in poverty and also face the full whammy of institutional racism with the rest of the black people.\n\nBut that's a different issue, that's class or wealth, not race. \n\nIf it was racism that was the issue, then we would see the effects in all (or at least most) black people, not just poor black people. \n\nIf it was class/wealth that was the issue, then we would see the effects in all poor people, regardless of colour, which we do.\n\nThat's why the whole \"institutional racism makes black people commit more crime\" is a logical fallacy. It's deciding the conclusion (racism) and then finding the evidence to fit the conclusion, while ignoring the evidence that doesn't.\n\nWhat you need to do is look at the evidence, then find a conclusion. The evidence suggests that poor people commit the vast majority of crime, whether they are black or white.\n\n*That* is the main problem in America and most of the civilised world.

In message-passing systems, two events are concurrent if they are enforced by different processes and each process enforced its event before it received the notification message from the other process. In other words, the notion of concurrency depends on the implementation of the object, not on its specification. Consequently, the final user may not know if two events are concurrent without explicitly tracking the messages exchanged by the processes. A specification should be independent of the system on which it is implemented. We believe that an object should be totally specified by two facets: its abstract data type, that characterizes its sequential executions, and a consistency criterion, that defines how it is supposed to behave in a distributed environment. Not only sequential specification helps repeal the problem of intention, it also allows to use the well studied and understood notions of languages and automata. This makes possible to apply all the tools developed for sequential systems, from their simple definition using structures and classes to the most advanced techniques like model checking and formal verification. Eventual consistency (EC) imposes no constraint on the convergent state, that very few depends on the sequential specification. For example, an implementation that ignores all the updates is eventually consistent, as all replicas converge to the initial state. We propose a new consistency criterion, update consistency (UC), in which the convergent state must be obtained by a total ordering of the updates, that contains the sequential order of each"

Work up to 100 reps total each workout.  Once that gets easy, start adding weight.\nColoredMarxers: That is because most peoples goals focus around hypertrophy and strength. As soon as they hear something along the lines of \"30 minute abs\" or \"100 pushups a day\" They freak out because most of these programs are money/attention grabbing schemes, yet very rarely are they actually geared towards muscle endurance like they should be.\nbipocni: Unless I was in the business of selling chinup bars, parallell bars, rings or weight belts I don't see how I could profit from this.\nColoredMarxers: Oh no, I think you may have misconstrued my statement, i was simply mentioning that the reason you may have been downvoted is a knee-jerk response many people on this sub have built in concerning programs that *sound* like the one you suggested. I actually believe a sizable volume of dips and pullups (leg free workouts) would be beneficial and fitting for his goals/condition.\nbipocni: Yeah, it's pretty much the only two exercises that would work.\n\nFor otherwise healthy people you can literally just add 100 reps of weighted decline situps, and that's all the upper body strength training you need.  Add elbow conditioning and/or balance practice if your goals involve advanced calisthenics, but for simple strength/size it really is all you need.\nColoredMarxers: I would even go as far to possibly add some parallel bar or ring support work if he was up for it. Maybe even bar deadhangs for grip strength. It would be fun to integrate a little twist into a workout that could possibly get a bit tedious with time.\nbipocni: 100 dips &amp; pullups gets tedious like hill sprints get tedious.  It's hard, and it sucks, but you won't exactly get *bored*.\n\nDwas hangs and support work aren't strictly speaking necessary, but they could be fun.  There's also the capacity to do different *kinds* of pullups, like chins, mixed grip, neutral, offset, towel grip, ect.  Dips could at least be moved up to Russian dips occasionally.  There's definitely room for play, as long as the spirit of the thing is kept intact.\nColoredMarxers: 100% agree. It is great to see that, even with half of your body considered out of commission, you can still have a fun, useful, and varied workout. Great talk haha.\nbipocni: I had fun.\n"

Inspired by existing taxonomies of eco-design tools and sustainability indicators, and in line with the CE characteristics, a classification of indicators aiming to assess, improve, monitor and communicate on the CE performance is proposed and discussed. In the developed taxonomy including 10 categories, C-indicators are differentiated regarding criteria such as the levels of CE implementation (e.g. micro, meso, macro), the CE loops (maintain, reuse, remanufacture, recycle), the performance (intrinsic, impacts), the perspective of circularity (actual, potential) they are taking into account, or their degree of transversality (generic, sector-specific). In addition, the database inventorying the 55 sets of C-indicators is linked to an Excel-based query tool to facilitate the selection of appropriate indicators according to the specific user's needs and requirements. This study enriches the literature by giving a first need-driven taxonomy of C-indicators, which is experienced on several use cases. It provides a synthesis and clarification to the emerging and must-needed research theme of C-indicators, and sheds some light on remaining key challenges like their effective uptake by industry. Eventually, limitations, improvement areas, as well as implications of the proposed taxonomy are intently addressed to guide future research on C-indicators and CE implementation."

While SIM achieves a two-fold improvement in spatial resolution compared to conventional optical microscopy, STED, RESOLFT, PALM/STORM, or SSIM have all gone beyond, pushing the limits of optical image resolution to the nanometer scale. Consequently, all super-resolution techniques open new avenues of biomedical research. Because the field is so young, the potential capabilities of different super-resolution microscopy approaches have yet to be fully explored, and uncertainties remain when considering the best choice of methodology. Thus, even for experts, the road to the future is sometimes shrouded in mist. The super-resolution optical microscopy roadmap of Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics addresses this need for clarity. It provides guidance to the outstanding questions through a collection of short review articles from experts in the field, giving a thorough discussion on the concepts underlying super-resolution optical microscopy, the potential of different approaches, the importance of label optimization (such as reversible photoswitchable proteins) and applications in which these methods will have a significant impact."

In some cases, the rate of change in prices (velocity) increases at the end of the auction (for canvas paintings and paintings by established artists). Our analysis suggests that the opening bid is positively related to on-line auction price levels of art at the beginning of the auction, but its effect declines toward the end of the auction. The order in which the lots appear in an art auction is negatively related to the current price level, with this relationship decreasing toward the end of the auction. This implies that lots that appear earlier have higher current prices during the early part of the auction, but that effect diminishes by the end of the auction. Established artists show a positive relationship with the price level at the beginning of the auction. Reputation or popularity of the artists and their investment potential as assessed by previous history of sales are positively related to the price levels at the beginning of the auction. The medium (canvas or paper) of the painting does not show any relationship with art auction price levels, but the size of the painting is negatively related to the current price during the early part of the auction.

He played solely as a batsman (Arthur Gwynn being given the wicket-keeping duties), with his highest score being 44 against Leicestershire.\nIn 1896, Porter was selected to represent the Irish national team against the MCC, in a match that did not have first-class status. He scored 18 runs as Ireland won by an innings, but did not play for his country again. During the Irish winter, during which no cricket was played, Porter played hockey for the Three Rock Rovers, gaining selection for the national hockey team in 1897. After graduating from Dublin University, he was called to the Irish Bar, becoming a barrister. However, in 1900, Porter enlisted as a private in the 45th (Dublin) Company of the Imperial Yeomanry, and was sent to South Africa. In June of that year, while fighting at Ladywood (near Lindley in the Orange Free State), he was badly wounded and four days later died of wounds.

In short, Einstein's equivalence principle isn't exact, but is an approximation that ignores recoil of the \"specified\" gravitational field, which sheds light on why general relativity has no clearly delineated native embodiment of conserved four-momentum. Einstein's 1905 relativity of course doesn't have the inexactitudes he unwittingly built into GR, so it is natural to explore a Lorentz-covariant gravitational theory patterned directly on electromagnetism, wherein a system's zero-divergence overall stress-energy, including all gravitational feedback contributions, is the source of its gravitational tensor potential. Remarkably, that alone completely determines Lorentz-covariant gravity's interaction with any conservative system of locally interacting classical fields; no additional \"principles\" of any kind are required. The highly intricate equation for the gravitational interaction contribution to such a system's Lagrangian density is only amenable to solution by successively refined approximation, however."

On the other hand, traditional compression techniques are also not much suitable for the compression of these types of sequential data. In this paper, we have explored diverse types of techniques for compression of large amounts of DNA Sequence Data. In this paper, the analysis of techniques reveals that efficient techniques not only reduce the size of the sequence but also avoid any information loss. The review of existing studies also shows that compression of a DNA sequence is significant for understanding the critical characteristics of DNA data in addition to improving storage efficiency and data transmission. In addition, the compression of the protein sequence is a challenge for the research community. The major parameters for evaluation of these compression algorithms include compression ratio, running time complexity etc."

Such an arrest of the cell cycle progression can lead either to an effective DNA repair, which may prevent transformation of normal into a cancer cell (carcinogenesis), or to cell death, often by the mode of apoptosis. An arrest of cells in G0 or G1 is often seen as a result of lack of nutrients (growth factors), for example after serum deprivation.\nCell cycle analysis was first described in 1969 at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory by a group from the University of California using the Feulgen staining technique. The first protocol for cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide staining was presented in 1975 by Awtar Krishan from Harvard Medical School and is still widely cited today.\nMultiparameter analysis of the cell cycle includes, in addition to measurement of cellular DNA content, other cell cycle related constituents/features. The concurrent measurement of cellular DNA and RNA content, or DNA susceptibility to denaturation at low pH using the metachromatic dye acridine orange, reveals the G1Q, G1A, and G1B cell cycle compartments and also makes it possible to discriminate between S, G2 and mitotic cells. The cells in G1Q are quiescent, temporarily withdrawn from the cell cycle (also identifiable as G0), the G1A are in the growth phase while G1B are the cells just prior entering S, with their growth (RNA and protein content, size) similar to that of the cells initiating DNA replication. Similar cell cycle compartments are also recognized by multiparameter analysis that includes measurement of expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin A and cyclin B1, each in relation to DNA content  Concurrent measurement of DNA content and of incorporation of DNA precursor 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) by flow cytometry is an especially useful assay, that has been widely used in analysis of the cell cycle in vitro and in vivo. However, the incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), the precursor whose detection offers certain advantages over BrdU, has now become the preferred methodology do detect DNA replicating (S-phase) cells."

The Navier Stokes equations were solved in ANSYS Fluent. The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation was used to account for the wall deformations. At the interface between the solid domain and the fluid domain, the fluid pressure was transferred to the wall and the displacement of the wall was transferred to the fluid. The two systems were connected by the System Coupling component which controls the solver execution of fluid and solid simulations in ANSYS. Fluid and solid domains were solved sequentially starting from the fluid simulations. Results. Distributions of blood flow, wall shear stress and wall stress were evaluated in the ascending thoracic aorta using the FSI analyses. We always observed a significant flow eccentricity in the simulations, in very good agreement with velocity profiles measured using 4D MRI. The results also showed significant increase of peak wall stress due to the increase of peripheral resistance and aortic stiffness. In the worst case scenario, the largest peripheral resistance (10 10 kg.s.m-4) and stiffness (10 MPa) resulted in a maximal principal stress equal to 702 kPa, whereas it was only 77 kPa in normal conditions. Conclusions. This is the first time that the risk of rupture of an aTAA is quantified in case of the combined effects of hypertension and aortic stiffness increase. Our findings suggest that a stiffer TAA may have the most altered distribution of wall stress and an acute change of peripheral vascular resistance could significantly increase the risk of rupture for a stiffer aneurysm."

Accordingly, we aimed to include translators, machine translation experts and non-binary individuals (as \"community experts\") on an equal footing. Our analysis shows that gender in machine translation requires a high degree of context sensitivity, that developers of such technologies need to position themselves cautiously in a process still under social negotiation, and that flexible approaches seem most adequate at present. We then illustrate steps that follow from our results for the field of gender-fair language technologies so that technological developments can adequately line up with social advancements. ---- Mit zunehmender gesamtgesellschaftlicher Wahrnehmung nicht-bin\\\"arer Personen haben sich in den letzten Jahren auch Konzepte von genderfairer Sprache von der bisher verwendeten Binarit\\\"at (weiblich/m\\\"annlich) entfernt.

Zehn Forscher*innen der TU Wien, FH St. P\\\"olten, FH Campus Wien und Universit\\\"at Wien organisierten und leiteten den Workshop.

This advantage is multiplied rapidly when buses and mass transit start eliminating commuter trips in 15+ cars.\nnaked_guy_says: I'm not putting words in your mouth, you said and I will quote\n\n&gt;From a anthropogenic climate change and greenhouse gas point of view: that sooty dirty diesel is **actually preferable** to those well running automobiles which are not expelling carbon black dust and are instead turning 100% of the fuel into carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and water.\n\nI went ahead and emphasized for the sake of attention your text.\nIn my response I barely extrapolated that to asking if all cars emitted carbon aerosol in the way they rolling coal does, would actually be preferable. And obviously that isn't the case, your specific point that greenhouse gases are worse is suffice.\n\nBuses as a transportation method over cars would be a massive improvement but electric or natural gas powered buses would be even better than diesel.

Simply haven't had any interest. I've heard the name *Skyrim* but know nothing about it at all.\n\nIf I were to sit down and play this game, would it be \"overrated\" from my perspective? Would I consider it to be a \"masterpiece?\" My memory of video games doesn't include a lot of dialogue or villagers (*Final Fantasy VII* maybe?), but I'll bet *Skyrim* would be far superior by comparison.\nDeliciousMelons: That\u2019s fair, if you haven\u2019t played games like Skyrim before, you may think it\u2019s a master piece. But I have played similar games, fantasy open world RPGS, that made the world feel a lot more immersive. That\u2019s why I believe the game is overrated, compared to other games in the same genre.\nBillionTonsHyperbole: Does the subjectivity of one's experience change your view at all? \n\nAnother example: I might find a Rubik's Cube flat and boring, but there's no denying that it's a masterpiece of a puzzle toy. I can appreciate it for what it is, how it's engineered, and certainly for its important place in the popular zeitgeist of Top Toys even if I personally find it to be lacking when it's in my hands.\nDeliciousMelons: Very interesting! However I don\u2019t see how this has anything to do with Skyrim being overrated. I believe Skyrim is a good game, I\u2019m not disputing that. But when compared to other games of the same genre, it falls flat for me. I believe there\u2019s a bias behind a lot of people\u2019s view of the game simply because it\u2019s rated so highly in the first place.\nBillionTonsHyperbole: It has to do with your subjectivity of experience. The \"Wisdom of the Crowd\" has apparently deemed that both the Rubik's Cube and *Skyrim* are masterpieces, at least for the time being. If you don't go for that, then that's fine, but they have still earned their very high ratings.\n\nSimilarly, many people will tell you that *Citizen Kane* is the greatest movie ever made. Plenty of people find it boring, but sufficient numbers of aficionados, experts, reviewers, and everyday film buffs rate it so highly that it maintains its position. Opinions will differ, but the designation remains.\nDeliciousMelons: You\u2019re right, opinions will differ. Views are typically based off opinions. Mine still hasn\u2019t been changed.\n"

If you can do more, do more.\ndudehellacool: &gt;So GVT 2x a week and normal training 1x? That could work.\n\nExactly, probably the FAQ routine. And then just:\n\n10x10 weighted pullups\n\n10x10 weighted dips\n\n10x10 rows\n\n10x10 weighed squats\n\nThese 4 would probably be enough for the other 2 days.

I think /u/UltraHumanite, who has his own GVT variation, likes to recommend 6 weeks at 5x10 before doing 10x10.\n\nAnd I think 5 exercises at GVT levels is too much. If you can do that much, you're probably not using GVT level of effort\ndudehellacool: Alright, Ill change it next time I do it. If I were to keep the rows, could I do ab work in a non- GVT style?

Approach: **LiveRec** is based on reusing existing debug protocols to implement probes. Methods or functions are compiled after every code change and executed inside the debugger. During execution the evolution of all local variables in the current stack frame are recorded and communicated back to the editor or IDE for display to the user. Knowledge: It turns out that mainstream debug protocols are rich enough for implementing live probes. Step-wise execution, code hot swapping, and stack frame inspection provide the right granularity and sufficient information to realize live probes, without modifying compilers or language runtimes. Furthermore, it turns out that the recently proposed Debugger Adapter Protocol (DAP) provides an even more generic approach of implementing live probes, but, in some cases, at the cost of a significant performance penalty. Grounding: We have applied **LiveRec** to implement probes using stack recording natively for Java through the Java Debug Interface (JDI), and through the DAP for Java, Python, C, and Javascript, all requiring just modest amounts of configuration code. We evaluate the run-time performance of all four probes prototypes, decomposed into: compile-after-change, hot swap, single step overhead, and stack recording overhead. Our initial results show that live probes on top of native debug APIs can be performant enough for interactive use. In the case of DAP, however, it highly depends on characteristics of the programming language implementation and its associated debugging infrastructure. Importance: Live programming improves the programmer experience by providing immediate feedback about a program's execution and eliminating disruptive edit-compile-restart sequences. Probes are one way to shorten the programmer feedback loop at the level of functions and methods. Although probes are not new, and have been implemented in (prototype) systems, **LiveRec**'s approach of building live probes on top of existing and generic debug protocols promises a path towards probes for a host of mainstream programming languages, with reasonable effort."

At the end of the field a little pink house with a tall and dark cypress tree that stands out against the distant purplish and bluish hills, and against a forget-me-not blue sky streaked with pink whose pure tones contrast with the already heavy, scorched ears, whose tones are as warm as the crust of a loaf of bread.\"\nHe sent an ink drawing of the painting (F1548, JH1726) with a letter to his brother Theo in early July 1889.  The drawing is now in the Morgan Library & Museum in New York City.  Van Gogh probably sent the painting to Theo with a consignment in September 1889.\nVan Gogh made several other paintings of wheat fields with cypresses when he was able to leave the asylum grounds and explore the local landscape, with the wheat rapidly turning to a ripe yellow. Besides a fondness for cypresses, van Gogh had a special affinity with wheat fields; he depicted them dozens of times over the years; to Vincent they symbolized the cycle of life and death, and he found in them both solace and inspiration.\nAlthough the composition is similar to several paintings by other artists such as Monet, Renoir, Sisley, and Pissarro, the art historian Ronald Pickvance says that \"compared to high Impressionist practice, color is used more locally and the brushstrokes are more organic and vigorously hatched.\" However, \"with no spatial distortions, no excessively heightened color tonalities, and no revolutionary symbolism, this landscape affirms its normality within an Impressionist convention. It neither manifests psychological tension nor projects a morbid vision.\"\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n"

Reading a new book, exploring various places where you live... Saving up for a trip out of town. Hiking in a well known trail. Learning the basics of photography. Training to run a 5k. Watching a new movie. Watching a series in Netflix. Volunteering at a soup kitchen. Learning how to cook a new dish. Learning how to bake a new dish. You could also look at what local events are coming up where you live and attend them. \n"

There is therefore untapped potential in this field.This article begins by outlining a typology and quantification of the past and potential roles of visual representations in medieval history. It examines two distinct intellectual approaches: 1. the use of visuals to support a scientific discourse (majority) and 2. the construction of a historical discourse based on observations made from visual figures with the aim of modeling phenomena invisible to the naked eye. The author thus examines the use of ''images'' in medievalism, focusing on the annual volumes of the Soci{\\'e}t{\\'e} des historiens m{\\'e}di{\\'e}vistes de l'enseignement sup{\\'e}rieur (SHMESP), up to 2006. Two other parts of the text look at the still-rare forms of visual representation in medieval history, particularly those with a ''heuristic vocation'', using iconographic objects, parchments, buildings and digitized texts. The article suggests various visualization techniques, such as network analysis, the creation of ''stemmas 2.0'' and interactive chronologies, which could benefit the discipline. These methods could potentially profoundly change our understanding of ancient societies, by showing the dynamic relationships between different aspects of these societies. One of the most important advances expected from these visual methods is a better understanding of the patterns of development in medieval Europe, which varied from region to region. The hypothesis is that the scarcity of heuristic graphics in medieval history stems from the relationship with ancient documents and the historical method based on narration and exemplarity. The article thus questions the value of ''visual modelling'' in medieval history, and highlights the challenges associated with the widespread adoption of this approach in the humanities and social sciences. Finally, the text invites us to reflect on the nature and functioning of heuristic visual devices, by comparing medieval ''images'' and contemporary scientific visuals. In both cases, the point is to materialize the invisible in order to show something that exists beyond the visual. The author suggests that this way of approaching visuals could play a growing role in the decades to come, particularly in the field of data science."

The growth of this disturbance mode destabilizes the flow, resulting in a turbulence transition at lower Reynolds numbers and closer to the nozzle compared to the conditions required for the transition to turbulence in a Newtonian jet. Increasing the fluid elasticity merges the shear-layer instability into a bulk instability of the jet column. In this regime, elastic tensile stresses generated in the shear layer act as an \"elastic membrane\" that partially stabilizes the flow, retarding the transition to turbulence to higher levels of inertia and greater distances from the nozzle. In the fully turbulent state far from the nozzle, planar viscoelastic jets exhibit unique spatio-temporal features associated with EIT. The time-averaged angle of jet spreading, an Eulerian measure of the degree of entrainment, and the centerline velocity of the jets both evolve self-similarly with distance from the nozzle. The autocovariance of the schlieren images in the fully turbulent region of the jets shows coherent structures that are elongated in the streamwise direction, consistent with the suppression of streamwise vortices by elastic stresses. These coherent structures give a higher spectral energy to small frequency modes in EIT characterized by LDV measurements of the velocity fluctuations at the jet centerline. Finally, our LDV measurements reveal a frequency spectrum characterized by a $-3$ power-law exponent, different from the well-known $-5/3$ power-law exponent characteristic of Newtonian turbulence."

        "text": ", when tidal effects are pronounced, these types of relationships and their variations have proven to be less effective. To capture the complex flow dynamics, including flow reversal, an approach via a 1D hydrodynamic model is proposed. Here, model estimation refers to estimating the posterior distribution of parameters and the structural error model.To set up the model, the cross-sectional geometry, friction coefficient, upstream discharge(s), and downstream water level are necessary. In hydrodynamic modeling, the friction coefficients, often represented through a set of Strickler coefficients, are the main calibration parameter, but manual calibration is difficult due to spatial variations in roughness combined with unsteady flow. Furthermore, understanding and quantifying uncertainties associated with data and the model are an important step in the calibration process. Therefore, automatic calibration of friction coefficients is proposed through Bayesian inference.In terms of numerical tools, the 1D hydrodynamic code used here is Mage, developed by INRAE, which solves the 1D Saint-Venant equations for river flows and transients. However, the proposed method is not specific to a given simulation code: it can be applied to any usual 1D hydrodynamic code. Bayesian calibration is performed using the software BaM! (Bayesian modeling: https://github.com/BaM-tools), which allows specifying prior information on model parameters (in this case, friction coefficients) to then estimate them with associated uncertainties, using observations themselves with their uncertainties (not only water levels but also gauging campaigns)."

Sounds pretty reasonable. We \"seasoned\" the bricks by doing this - everyday for 5 days we made a bigger and hotter fire. Starting out with a very small 200 degree fire and ending with the 800 degree fire.\neldorel: If you're planning on consistently going into the 800 degree range then you are going to start having problems pretty quickly.  \n\nAre you planning on cooking 20+ inch pizzas, are you working on loaves of bread, or are you planning to cook multiple items with only one firing? \n\nThe oven my brother used for demonstrations was about the size of your oven, and and hour fired to 650 was usually enough to do an entire flat ( 9 loaves ) and a large pizza after the demo.\n\nEven if you gently condition the oven every time the humidity gets above 60%, at 800 degrees that mortar will probably start breaking down just from the heat after a few months.  \n\nAfter looking at the photos again, do you have a door for that oven, or are you leaving it open?\nkevin530: Leaving it open\neldorel: You should make a door for it.\nIt helps the oven to heat up faster, and lets you use a smaller fire to get the oven to temp. It also helps keep the oven at the right temperature for much longer. \n\nYou can see an example of one we made on top of the oven in [this](http://i.imgur.com/FMg3t41.jpg) photo.\n\nThat one is a handle attached to two layers of wood with a layer of leather cover in a canvas pad. \nThe entire door gets dipped in water every time before being wedged into the opening, and it has a 1/2 inch opening for draft above the door.  \n\nWe have a hinged metal and wood door on his normal oven.

Full of water, they weigh about 22lbs each.   I've managed to get up to 3x8 squatting them, so I've dumped them and am letting them dry before I try putting quickcrete in them and see if that will raise the mass in a useful amount.   The nice thing about them is that they have handles on top.   \n\nI'm pretty certain one will not hold an entire 50lbs bag of quickcrete, though, so I may have a barbell in my future, but considering my ~$100 investment for the last 6 months of exercise, I think that may be fair.   \nkadoodledum: Awesome! Concrete hm? Is it heavier than sand per cubic unit though? And do you think it'd work for deadlifts?\nklew3: Average unit weight of concrete is 150pcf (lbs/cubic foot) while sands typically are about 120pcf. Source - bachelor's in civil engineering. Sand will be denser if compacted and/or well graded (lots of different grain sizes) which maximizes volume occupied by the material. \n\nThat said concrete is the result of hydrated cement with some sort of aggregate like sand, gravel, etc. The aggregate adds or reduces bulk and weight depending on what you use. Cement is a dry powder that reacts with water to form the binder in concrete. I have no idea off the top of my head what cement weighs. Sorry if somewhat useless for this convo. Quickcrete is I believe a brand of cement, can't remember if it has aggregate in it or not. \n\nEdit: Quickcrete does have sand and gravel.\nkadoodledum: Wow. TIL about concrete and different densities. Cool. But out of practicality, sand would be the best option in a duffel bag? I don't see how concrete can be used in a bag without being awkward to use. \nklew3: Yeah I imagine sand is the best option as it contours to your body and is relatively inexpensive especially if you have decent sand around where you live that's free for the taking.\n"

Used to be able to do loads of weighted exercises but injured myself due to bad form and was out for like 8 weeks so trina get back into the swing of things. \nU reckon this is hitting the majority of upper major muscle groups?\nlilsma333: If i were you i would tryout olympic dippushups on dumbells or somthin to elevate your hands, this is for lower pec isolation (lookup dumbell lower pec on youtube) its a 7/10 for me 8-9/10 if you do them perfect, dips are amazing for lower chest development and i noticed they built my whole chest great but at a certain point i almost tore my pec(ego liften my chest couodnt handle weight) and my mind muscle activation with my chest has not been the same since, not sure if anyone else has experienced this. Chestflys are also great for lower pec isolation but they are uncomfertable for me. I. think if i get my weighted pushup to an insane number for my weight(125ish) ill reach near my genetic potential for chest n tricep n frontal delt development but only time will tell. And your question about if this is hitting majority of major muscle groups yes i thinkso but lmk what you think i could improve because there's always room to improve. You could mess with sets and reps to fit your needs, swap high volume pullups for rows but tbh i really do think if you keep it simple and just get insanely strong at the upper callithenics compound movements and make every rep count you'll uncover alot of your genetic potential if you're consistent\nanonymoose-moose02: Mate really appreciate the help. Imma look into those dips. Do they have to be done on bars or something cus I don\u2019t have anywhere in my house that resembles a dip station?\n\nI think my main piece of advice which I\u2019ve learnt from injuring my lower back and still recovering is make sure every single rep has perfect form. And if you\u2019re near ur max and ur form is lacking don\u2019t do it it\u2019s not worth it trust me. Also very important to stretch to prevent this especially with weighted.\nlilsma333: You can use a walker(things for old people)for dips a counter top that makes a right angle it'll resemble this( L )or this (V ) also straightbar dips go hard and thanks bro you definetly saved me from lowerback pain because ive been ignoring some stuff when it comes to lower body, as for stretching ima educate myself on that to get effective stretching routines for the things that irritate me. ima go get that grind my guy peace wish u well in all that you do\nanonymoose-moose02: Seems like you\u2019re in the exact same position I was. If you do feel something don\u2019t keep working it cus that\u2019s how mine just got worse over time. Listen to you\u2019re body and take a couple days off. May hurt you\u2019re ego as it did mine but it\u2019ll be a lot better in the long run. Also see if you can buy some tiger balm online. Dunno if you\u2019ve heard about it but that shit does wonders for muscle relief and warming up the muscles. \nDefo educate yourself on stretching like I did. So so important\nWish you and you\u2019re family well bro stay safe and healthy and use all this time as best as we can\nlilsma333: \ud83d\udc99\n"

I thought it might be a flexibility issue, but I've developed decent flexibility in my ankles at this point. Then I thought balance, so I added 8lbs in front of me and was able to perform my reps perfectly. \n\n\nShould I continue to use the weight as I go lower and lower until it's just the floor, or should I continue using the weight until I can do then without it at my current box height, then go down and repeat?\n\n\n**2.** I'm doing the startbodyweight routine, and one of the issues I've seen is that it is imbalanced with 3 pushes and 2 pulls. I haven't noticed any issues in this regard. I do BJJ and there is a lot of pulling involved. Could this potentially balance out the push-pull? Is there another pull I can add to balance things? Should I add extra sets of my pulls?\ncuriouscalisthenist: 1. Use minimal weight, get full ROM, then reduce weights. Or try doing assisted pistols, holding to some pole or pushing off of a bench.\n\n2. Keep 1 for each vert/hori push/pull. Doing 3 push/pull would just be too much, unless you're an intermediate or advanced.\neman_resu_tluafed: I'm not new to this. I've only been doing BWF for 6 months, but I've been in pretty good shape for the last 6 years since I started BJJ.

If you still want to add something, I guess you'd be fine with adding another set or two of a different variation of pull ups I suppose. Or, work on L/V/Manna progressions, they work almost the same muscles as pulling afaik.\neman_resu_tluafed: Beginner to BWF, sure, but not to fitness. Not sure what L/V/Manna is. \ncuriouscalisthenist: L sit, V sit, Manna. Progressions.\neman_resu_tluafed: Working with L-sit. Not a fan, honestly. \n\nLooked up the manna. Didn't even know that was a thing. \ncuriouscalisthenist: L sits take a long time if you don't have the scapular strength or the hip flexor strength or the hamstring flexibility or a combination of them or all of them or many more factors. I suggested it because it uses the same muscles as pulling afaik, so, in the end, you'd be having a different exercise for the addition you seek.\n\nYea, I accept, they're hard.\neman_resu_tluafed: Thanks.

Thereby where decision-making could be seen as a constructed model, collaborative decision-making, for us,is seen as the use of socio-technical media to improve decision-making performance and acceptability. The shared decision making is a core activity in a lot of human activities. For example, the sustainable decision-making is the job of not only governments and institutions but also broader society. Recognizing the urgent need for sustainability, we can argue that to realize sustainable development, it must be considered as a decision-making strategy. The location of knowledge in the realization of collaborative decision-making has to be regarded insofar as knowledge sharing leads to improve collaborative decision-making: a ``static view'' has to be structured and constitutes the ``collaborative knowledge.''

Typically, the process consists in applying a high voltage difference between a metallic piece and a counter-electrode which are both immersed in an electrolyte bath. Compare to anodizing, the main differences concern the electrolyte composition and the current and voltage ranges which are at least one order of magnitude higher in PEO 1. These significant differences in current and voltage imply the dielectric breakdown and consequently the appearance of micro-discharges on the surface of the sample under processing. Those micro-discharges are recognized as being the main contributors to the formation of a dielectric porous crystalline oxide coating. 2 Nevertheless, the breakdown mechanism that governs the appearance of those micro-discharges is still under investigation. Hussein et al. 3 proposed a mechanism with three different plasma formation processes based on differences in plasma chemical composition. The results of Jovovi{\\'c} et al. 4,5 concerning physical properties of the plasma seem to corroborate this mechanism, and also point out the importance of the substrate material in the plasma composition. 6 Compared with DC conducted PEO process, using a bipolar pulsed DC or AC current supply gives supplementary control latitude through the current waveform parameters. The effect of these parameter on the micro-discharges behavior has been investigated in several previous works. 2,3,7,8 One of the main results of these studies is the absence of micro-discharge during the cathodic current half-period. 9-11 Even if the cathodic half-period has an obvious effect on the efficiency of PEO as well as on the coating growth and composition, the micro-plasmas appear only in anodic half-period. Sah et al. 8 have observed the cathodic breakdown of an oxide layer but at very high current density (10 kA.dm-${}^2$), and after several steps of sample preparation. Several models of micro-discharges appearance in AC current have already been proposed. 1,2,8,12,13 Though cathodic micro-discharges have never been observed within usual process conditions, the present study aims at defining suitable conditions to promote cathodic micro-discharges and at studying the main characteristics of these micro-plasmas."

The models supported by tools of the Modelica class involve multiple modes with mode-dependent DAE based dynamics and state-dependent mode switching. Multimode DAE are much more difficult than DAE. The main difficulty is the handling of the events of mode change. Unfortunately, the large literature devoted to the mathematical analysis of DAEs does not cover the multimode case, typically saying nothing about mode changes. This lack of foundations causes numerous difficulties to the existing modeling tools. Some models are well handled, others are not, with no clear boundary between the two classes. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive mathematical approach supporting compilation and code generation for this class of languages. Its core is the structural analysis of multimode DAE systems. As a byproduct of this structural analysis, we propose well sound criteria for accepting or rejecting models. For our mathematical development, we rely on nonstandard analysis, which allows us to cast hybrid systems dynamics to discrete time dynamics with infinitesimal step size, thus providing a uniform framework for handling both continuous dynamics and mode change events."

We validated the results of our analysis pipeline by performing long-term simultaneous scalp -- intracerebral (SEEG) recordings in 14 patients and analyzing the wavelet coherence between the independent component encoding the ictal discharge and the SEEG signals in 8 patients passing the inclusion criteria. Our results show that invasively recorded ictal onset patterns, including low-voltage fast activity, can be captured by the independent component analysis of scalp EEG. The visibility of the ictal activity strongly depends on the depth of the sources. The equivalent current dipole localization can point to the seizure onset zone (SOZ) with an accuracy that can be as high as 10mm for superficially located sources, that gradually decreases for deeper seizure generators, averaging at 47 mm in the 8 analyzed patients. Independent component analysis is therefore shown to have a promising SOZ localizing value, indicating whether the seizure onset zone is neocortical, and its approximate location, or located in mesial structures.

That's how it is. Could you prove that they torrent them? If they wanted to distribute a free license, I certainly am happy to see them do so, but surely would do it through their website. Also, I don't think programs like those need \"promotion\". This isn't a budding new band looking to work for free, it's a company released 100-10000 dollar software for mostly professional use. So unless you can substantiate that claim, then you've absolutely said nothing. It might be you living a fairy world looking to protect yourself or others from the label of thief. \ndennis77: Man, I've worked for Gameloft for 4 years, and I know how it works. Torrents are a good way to promote new software and even movies. The guys who will torrent that will find a way anyway, but by submitting it before the actual show, you can get lots of buzz around the subject and more people will go to movie theaters after that. \n\nThat's simply a hook.\n"

They say they like a certain musician, listen to that musician before the next time you see them so you can comment on that.  The easiest way to fake an interest in a person is not to fake it, genuinely look into what they are interested in.  \n\nIt doesn't even have to be something you like.  My friend is a football fan, and I fucking hate sports.  But I know the team she likes and the team she hates, and I put stuff from the team she hates on her desk at work.  Even if you do something annoying to tease a friend, at least do it in a way that shows you listen to what they say and see them.\nPhysical_Key_4041: so with the musician example say I listen to a band they recommend, how would I then comment about that band in the follow up conversation\n\nlike for example I like avatar the last air bender (show) yet even if I meet someone else who likes the show I wouldn\u2019t know how to talk about it with them, like do I just say \u201cI liked the band you recommended\u201d surely not that ain\u2019t really a convo, so like say I listen to the band they recommend, how would I then discuss that band with them \n\nor take avatar the last airbender how would I discuss the show with someone that\u2019s already seen it\nthe_entroponaut: That's an interesting question, because I guess if I said \"It will just flow from there\" then that wouldn't be helpful at all!  \n\nIt is tricky to answer though, because conversations are so dynamic that it is hard to apply programmatic rules to them.  I mean, I loved The Last Airbender, but it is hard to come up with cold topics about it.  Personally I might bring up themes of apotheosis in shows (though some people might think I'm pretentious for that, but I am pretentious so I guess that's just me).  Or how I really love that the series format can grant a long time for several character development arcs that a movie can't, evolving into a metal bender or a blood bender and such.  Basically you are going to go into some (but not exhaustive) detail about why you liked it, and your favorite parts, and find out theirs.\n\nAnd that guidelines applies to most topics.  Music talk tends to be a bit more shallow (unless you are a musician) than movie/TV talk.  It's usually along a format of \"I liked this band, it reminded me of this band, have you heard of them?\"  A finding common ground kind of thing.\n"

        "text": " believe propositions2 to be true (or to be false or neither). Probability theory, however, offers no formal counterpart to this notion. Believing A is not the same as having probability 1 for A, because probability 1 is incorrigible3; but plain belief is clearly corrigible. And believing A is not the same as giving A a probability larger than some 1 - c, because believing A and believing B is usually taken to be equivalent to believing A & B.4 Thus, it seems that the formal representation of plain belief has to take a non-probabilistic route. Indeed, representing plain belief seems easy enough: simply represent an epistemic state by the set of all propositions believed true in it or, since I make the common assumption that plain belief is deductively closed, by the conjunction of all propositions believed true in it. But this does not yet provide a theory of induction, i.e. an answer to the question how epistemic states so represented are changed tbrough information or experience. There is a convincing partial answer: if the new information is compatible with the old epistemic state, then the new epistemic state is simply represented by the conjunction of the new information and the old beliefs. This answer is partial because it does not cover the quite common case where the new information is incompatible with the old beliefs. It is, however, important to complete the answer and to cover this case, too; otherwise, we would not represent plain belief as conigible. The crucial problem is that there is no good completion. When epistemic states are represented simply by the conjunction of all propositions believed true in it, the answer cannot be completed; and though there is a lot of fruitful work, no other representation of epistemic states has been proposed, as far as I know, which provides a complete solution to this problem. In this paper, I want to suggest such a solution. In [4], I have more fully argued that this is the only solution, if certain plausible desiderata are to be satisfied. Here, in section 2, I will be content with formally defining and intuitively explaining my proposal. I will compare my proposal with probability theory in section 3. It will turn out that the theory I am proposing is structurally homomorphic to probability theory in important respects and that it is thus equally easily implementable, but moreover computationally simpler. Section 4 contains a very brief comparison with various kinds of logics, in particular conditional logic, with Shackle's functions of potential surprise and related theories, and with the Dempster - Shafer theory of belief functions."

        "text": " creating different database users for different software components. Thus, it is difficult to use existing tools to properly limit the authority an application has when executing queries. For this reason, we consider a new, language-based approach to application-specific database security. Approach: Prior work has addressed the difficulty of running applications with least privilege using capability-based security and software contracts, which we adapt to the setting of database-backed applications. Knowledge: This paper's main contribution is the design and implementation of ShillDB, a language for writing secure database-backed applications. ShillDB enables reasoning about database access at the language level through capabilities, which limit which database tables a program can access, and contracts, which limit what operations a program can perform on those tables. ShillDB contracts are expressed as part of function interfaces, making it easy to specify different access control policies for different components. Contracts act as executable security documentation for ShillDB programs and are enforced by the language runtime. Further, ShillDB provides database access control guarantees independent of (and in addition to) the security mechanisms of the underlying database management system. Grounding: We have implemented a prototype of ShillDB and have used it to implement the backend for a lending library reservation system with contracts for each endpoint to evaluate the performance and usability of ShillDB. Further, we benchmark individual database operations in ShillDB to better understand the language's performance overhead. Importance: Our experience indicates that ShillDB is a practical language for enforcing database access control policies in realistic, multi-user applications and has reasonable performance overhead. ShillDB allows developers to reason about security at the component level, safely compose components, and reuse third-party components with their own application-specific database security policies."

According to the International Panel on Climate Change (European Union, 2010), 30% of energy used in buildings could be reduced with net economic benefits by 2030. Such a reduction, however, is meaningless unless \"sustainability\" is considered. Because of these factors, healthy, sustainable, and energy efficient buildings have become active topics in international research; there is an urgent need for a new kind of high-technology driven and integrative research that should lead to the massive development of smart buildings and, in the medium term, smart cities. From a building lifecycle perspective, most of the energy (~80%) is consumed during the operational stage of the building (European Union, 2010) (Bilsen et al., 2013). Reducing building energy consumption may be addressed by the physical modifications which can be operated on a building like upgrading windows, heating systems or modifying thermic characteristics by insulating. Another possible path to reduce the energy consumption of a building is to use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). According to the International Panel on Climate Change, a reduction of energy even greater than the 30% can be targeted by 2030 by considering ICT solutions. In support of this claim, some specialists believe that ICT-based solutions have the potential to enable 50-80% greenhouse gas reduction globally. In this respect, ICT innovation opens prospects for the development of a new range of new services highly available, flexible, safe, easy to integrate, and user friendly (Bilsen et al., 2013). This, in turn, should foster a sophisticated, reliable and fast communication infrastructure for the connection of various distributed elements (sensors, generators, substations...) that enables to exchange real-time data, information and knowledge needed to improve efficiency (e.g., to monitor and control energy consumption), reliability (e.g., to facilitate maintenance operations), flexibility (e.g., to integrate new rules to meet new consumer expectations), and investment returns, but also to induce a shift in consumer behaviour."

We present a heuristic for numeric planning problems building on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematical program for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer--consumer planning problems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelled in a mixed integer program (MIP). This MIP is then combined with a metric Relaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic to produce an integrated hybrid heuristic. The MIP tracks resource use more accurately than the usual relaxation, but relaxes the ordering of actions, while the RPG captures the causal propositional aspects of the problem. We discuss how these two components interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explore how further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into the MIP. We show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem to augment the MIP can yield more accurate guidance, partly by exploiting structure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources. Our results show that the use of this heuristic enhances scalability on problems where numeric resource interaction is key in finding a solution."

We built a grid of dust models and investigated the key parameters to reproduce the general trend of surface bright- nesses and intensity ratios of both coreshine and near-infrared observations with the help of a 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code. The grid parameters allow to investigate the effect of coagulation upon spherical grains up to 5 $\\mu$m in size derived from the DustEm diffuse interstellar medium grains. Fluffiness (porosity or fractal degree), ices, and a handful of classical grain size distributions were also tested. We used the near- and mostly mid-infrared intensity ratios as strong discriminants between dust models. Results. The determination of the background field intensity at each wavelength is a key issue. In particular, an especially strong background field explains why we do not see coreshine in the Galactic plane at 3.6 and 4.5 $\\mu$m. For starless cores, where detected, the observed 4.5 $\\mu$m / 3.6 $\\mu$m coreshine intensity ratio is always lower than $\\sim$0.5 which is also what we find in the models for the Taurus-Perseus and L183 directions. Embedded sources can lead to higher fluxes (up to four times greater than the strongest starless core fluxes) and higher coreshine ratios (from 0.5 to 1.1 in our selected sample). Normal interstellar radiation field conditions are sufficient to find suitable grain models at all wavelengths for starless cores. The standard interstellar grains are not able to reproduce observations and, due to the multi-wavelength approach, only a few grain types meet the criteria set by the data. Porosity does not affect the flux ratios while the fractal dimension helps to explain coreshine ratios but does not seem able to reproduce near-infrared observations without a mix of other grain types. Conclusions. Combined near- and mid-infrared wavelengths confirm the potential to reveal the nature and size distribution of dust grains. Careful assessment of the environmental parameters (interstellar and background fields, embedded or nearby reddened sources) is required to validate this new diagnostic."

Three particular settings of feedback control are introduced: constant value over the domain throughout the iteration; alternating values between iteration steps; and spatially variant values. We also introduce three spectral measures of the displacement Jacobian for characterizing a DVF. These measures reveal the critical role of what we term the non-translational displacement component (NTDC) of the DVF. We carry out inversion experiments with an analytical DVF pair, and with DVFs associated with thoracic CT images of 6 patients at end of expiration and end of inspiration. Results: NTDC-adaptive iterations are shown to attain a larger convergence region at a faster pace compared to previous non-adaptive DVF inversion iteration algorithms. By our numerical experiments, alternating control yields smaller IC residuals and inversion errors than constant control. Spatially variant control renders smaller residuals and errors by at least an order of magnitude, compared to other schemes, in no more than 10 steps. Inversion results also show remarkable quantitative agreement with analysis-based predictions. Conclusion: Our analysis captures properties of DVF data associated with clinical CT images, and provides new understanding of iterative DVF inversion algorithms with a simple residual feedback control. Adaptive control is necessary and highly effective in the presence of non-small NTDCs. The adaptive iterations or the spectral measures, or both, may potentially be incorporated into deformable image registration methods."

That's why you're plunging and that's why it's backing up right there and leaking out. A toilet is a gravity flow device and if there isn't a clean 'drop' it backs up.

He'll be equipped to run a snake through the waste line and find out what's what. If it's roots or something your regular drain snake will not really remove them; it will just puch a hole through letting the water flow but leaving the waste and roots behind to back up again sometime. You would need something with a cutter head. Most can also run a CCTV camera down there to observe the issue if at first they don't succeed. Might be difficult getting one on a holiday but you could try. Good luck.\n\n\nNot-enough: You should allow the wax seal to warm up to room temp before installing it, if your leak is coming from the base of the toilet then it can certainly be from the installation/possibly a split on the flange.

These results are non-Hermitian analogues of some recent universality results for Hermitian Wigner matrices. However, a key new difficulty arises in the non-Hermitian case, due to the instability of the spectrum for such matrices. To resolve this issue, we the need to work with the log-determinants $\\log|\\det(M_n-z_0)|$ rather than with the Stieltjes transform $\\frac{1}{n}\\operatorname {tr}(M_n-z_0)^{-1}$, in order to exploit Girko's Hermitization method. Our main tools are a four moment theorem for these log-determinants, together with a strong concentration result for the log-determinants in the Gaussian case. The latter is established by studying the solutions of a certain nonlinear stochastic difference equation. With some extra consideration, we can extend our arguments to the real case, proving universality for correlation functions of real matrices which match the real Gaussian ensemble to the fourth order. As an application, we show that a real $n\\times n$ matrix whose entries are jointly independent, exponentially decaying and whose moments match the real Gaussian ensemble to fourth order has $\\sqrt{\\frac{2n}{\\pi}}+o(\\sqrt{n})$ real eigenvalues asymptotically almost surely."

Simultaneously, the burden on the driver is reduced by optimizing the vehicle velocity, whilst minimizing any journey time penalty.In this work, the development of dependable Automated Driving Functions is exemplified by the Traffic Light Assistant, an adaptive strategy that utilizes predictions of preceding traffic, upcoming road curvature, inclination, speed limits, and especially traffic light signal phase and timing information to increase the energy efficiency in an urban traffic environment. A key aspect of this development is the possibility for seamless and simultaneous development; from office simulation to human-in-the-loop and to real-time tests that include vehicle and powertrain hardware. Driver's acceptance and comfort is rated in an advanced diver simulator mounted on a hexapod, capable of emulating longitudinal and lateral acceleration of a real vehicle. Test results from real-time function validation on a Powertrain Testbed are shown, including real traffic light signal phasing information and traffic flow representation on Graz city roads."

The model results in a large relaxation time of order t b exp(L/RT) where L is the molar latent heat of vaporization, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. We model the late time relaxation for a near spherical cap and find an exponential relaxation whose typical time scale agrees reasonably well with the experiment. 1. Introduction Fusion or coalescence between drops is a key process in a wide range of phenomena: phase transition in fluids and liquid mixtures or polymers, stability of foams and emulsions, and sintering in metallurgy (Eggers 1998), which is why the problem of coalescence has already received considerable attention. Most of the studies of this process so far have been devoted to the coalescence of two spherical drops floating in a medium. The kinetics of the process before and after the drops have touched each other is governed by the hydrodynamics inside and outside the drops and by the van der Waals forces when the drops are within mesoscopic distance from each other (Yiantsios \\& Davis 1991). The composite drop that results from the coalescence of two drops relaxes to a spherical shape within a time which is dominated by the relaxation of the flow inside and outside (Nikolayev, Beysens \\& Guenoun 1996; Nikolayev \\& Beysens 1997). There are no studies, to our knowledge, of the coalescence of two sessile drops after they touch each other. In this paper, we report a preliminary study of the dynamics and morphology of this process, in the case of hemispherical water droplets which grow slowly on a plane surface at the expense of the surrounding atmosphere, forming what is called 'dew' or 'breath figures' (Beysens et al. 1991; Beysens 1995). The drops eventually touch each other and coalesce to form an elongated composite"

        "text": " then an active research area consists in studying this law in the rigorous framework of the Navier-Stokes equations which describe in a mathematical way the fluids motion and in particular the movement of turbulent fluids. In this setting, the purpose of this chapter is to highlight the fact that if we consider the Navier-Stokes equations on R3 then certain physical quantities, necessary for the study of the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, have no a rigorous definition and then to give a sense to these quantities we suggest to consider the Navier-Stokes equations with an additional damping term. In the framework of these damped equations, we obtain some estimates for the energy's dissipation rate according to the Kolmogorov's dissipation law.In the second chapter we are interested in study the stationary solutions of the damped Navier- Stokes introduced in the previous chapter. These stationary solutions are a particular type of solutions which do not depend of the temporal variable and their study is motivated by the fact that we always consider the Navier-Stokes equations with a stationary external force. In this chapter we study two properties of the stationary solutions : the first property concerns the stability of these solutions where we prove that if we have a control on the external force then all non stationary solution (with depends of both spatial and temporal variables) converges toward a stationary solution. The second property concerns the decay in spatial variable of the stationary solutions. These properties of stationary solutions are a consequence of the damping term introduced in the Navier-Stokes equations.In the third chapter we still study the stationary solutions of Navier-Stokes equations but now we consider the classical equations (without any additional damping term). The purpose of this chapter is to study an other problem related to the deterministic description of the turbulence : the frequency decay of the stationary solutions. Indeed, according to the K41 theory, if the fluid is in a laminar setting then the stationary solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations must exhibit a exponential frequency decay which starts at lows frequencies. But, if the fluid is in a turbulent setting then this exponential frequency decay must be observed only at highs frequencies. In this chapter, using some Fourier analysis tools, we give a precise description of this exponential frequency decay in the laminar and in the turbulent setting.In the fourth and last chapter we return to the stationary solutions of the classical Navier-Stokes equations and we study the uniqueness of these solutions in the particular case without any external force. Following some ideas of G. Seregin, we study the uniqueness of these solutions first in the framework of Lebesgue spaces of and then in the a general framework of Morrey spaces."

Unfortunately, the company that manufactured our boiler went out of business before I installed it due to it being new-old stock. That coupled with almost no information online for the model meant I was pretty much forced to go in blind on the whole thing.

        "text": ". Approach. In this work, we put forward a refinement of TSOP for concurrent objects guaranteeing that well-typed programs not only conform with the protocol of the objects they use, but are also deadlock free. The key ingredients of the type system are behavioral types, used to specify and enforce object protocols, and dependency relations, used to represent abstract descriptions of the dependencies between objects and detect circularities that might cause deadlocks. Knowledge. The proposed approach stands out for two features. First, the approach is fully compositional and therefore scalable: the objects of a large program can be type checked in isolation; deadlock freedom of an object composition solely depends on the types of the objects being composed; any modification/refactoring of an object that does not affect its public interface does not affect other objects either. Second, we provide the first deadlock analysis technique for join patterns, a high-level concurrency abstraction with which programmers can express complex synchronizations in a succinct and declarative form. Grounding. We detail the proposed typing discipline for a core programming language blending concurrent objects, asynchronous message passing and join patterns. We prove that the type system is sound and give non-trivial examples of programs that can be successfully analyzed. A Haskell implementation of the type system that demonstrates the feasibility of the approach is publicly available. Importance. The static analysis technique described in this work can be used to certify programs written in a core language for concurrent TSOP with proven correctness guarantees. This is an essential first step towards the integration and application of the technique in a real-world developer toolchain, making programming of such systems more productive and less frustrating."

Additional features are also investigated in order to improve the classifiers' performance. In addition, the combination of several learning algorithms with various techniques for fixing the number of relevant topics is performed. On the other hand, ESA seems promising for this classification task as it yielded interesting results in related issues, such as semantic relatedness computation between texts and text classification. Unlike existing works, which use ESA for enriching the bag-of-words approach with additional knowledge-based features, our ESA-based method builds a standalone classifier. Furthermore, we investigate if the results of this method could be useful as a complementary feature of our kNN-based approach.ResultsExperimental evaluations performed on large standard annotated datasets, provided by the BioASQ organizers, show that the kNN-based method with the Random Forest learning algorithm achieves good performances compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, reaching a competitive f-measure of 0.55% while the ESA-based approach surprisingly yielded reserved results.ConclusionsWe have proposed simple classification methods suitable to annotate textual documents using only partial information. They are therefore adequate for large multi-label classification and particularly in the biomedical domain. Thus, our work contributes to the extraction of relevant information from unstructured documents in order to facilitate their automated processing.

For example, the canonical parametrization of the stress equations is just described by the formal adjoint of the n2(n2 -- 1)/12 components of the linearized Riemann tensor considered as a linear second order differential operator but the minimum number of potentials needed in elasticity theory is equal to n(n -- 1)/2 for any minimal parametrization. Meanwhile, we can provide all the above results without even using indices for writing down explicit formulas in the way it is done in any textbook today. The example of relativistic continuum mechanics with n = 4 is provided in order to prove that it could be strictly impossible to obtain such results without using the above methods. We also revisit the possibility (Maxwell equations of electromag- netism) or the impossibility (Einstein equations of gravitation) to obtain canonical or minimal parametrizations for various other equations of physics. It is nevertheless important to notice that, when n and the algorithms presented are known, most of the calculations can be achieved by using computers for the corresponding symbolic computations. Finally, though the paper is mathematically oriented as it aims providing new insights towards the mathematical foundations of elasticity theory and mathematical physics, it is written in a rather self-contained way."

All these computations used seven parameters: B-V, log(Re), nV , $\\mu$e , H$\\beta$ , D4000 , log(M *). Results. We have obtained a tree for the combined samples and do not find different evolutionary paths for cluster and field galaxies. However, the cluster galaxies seem to have accelerated evolution in the sense they are statistically more diversified from a primitive common ancestor. The separate analyses show a hint for a slightly more regular evolution of the variables for the cluster galaxies, which may indicate they are more homogeneous as compared to field galaxies in the sense that the groups of the latter appear to have more specific properties. On the tree for the cluster galaxies, there is a separate branch which gathers rejunevated or stripped-off groups of galaxies. This branch is clearly visible on the colour-magnitude diagram, going back from the red sequence towards the blue one. On this diagram, the distribution and the evolutionary paths of galaxies are strikingly different for the two samples. Globally, we do not find any dominant variable able to explain either the groups or the tree structures. Rather, co-evolution appears everywhere, and could depend itself on environment or mass. Conclusions. This study is another demonstration that unsupervised machine learning is able to go beyond the simple scaling relations by taking into account several properties together. The phylogenetic approach is invaluable to trace the evolutionary scenarii and project them onto any biavariate diagram without any a priori modelling. Our WINGS galaxies are all at low redshift, and we now need to go to higher redshfits to find more primitve galaxies and complete the map of the evolutionary paths of present day galaxies."

FRACS is based on the ray-tracing technique without scattering, but supplemented with the use of quadtree meshes and the full symmetries of the axisymmetrical problem to significantly decrease the necessary computing time to obtain e.g. monochromatic images and visibilities. We applied FRACS in a theoretical study of the dusty circumstellar environments (CSEs) of B[e] supergiants (sgB[e]) in order to determine which information (physical parameters) can be retrieved from present mid-IR interferometry (flux and visibility). From a set of selected dusty CSE models typical of sgB[e] stars we show that together with the geometrical parameters (position angle, inclination, inner radius), the temperature structure (inner dust temperature and gradient) can be well constrained by the mid-IR data alone. Our results also indicate that the determination of the parameters characterising the CSE density structure is more challenging but, in some cases, upper limits as well as correlations on the parameters characterising the mass loss can be obtained. Good constraints for the sgB[e] central continuum emission (central star and inner gas emissions) can be obtained whenever its contribution to the total mid-IR flux is only as high as a few percents. Ray-tracing parameterised models such as FRACS are thus well adapted to prepare and/or interpret long wavelengths (from mid-IR to radio) observations at present (e.g. VLTI/MIDI) and near-future (e.g. VLTI/MATISSE, ALMA) interferometers."

It will also be a crucial ingredient in developing simulation schemes that are faithful to the underlying model over long periods of time. The goal of this work is to study qualitative properties of the above stochastic system as the number of particles (N) and the time parameter (n) approach infinity. In this regard asymptotic properties of a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system, that arises in the propagation of chaos limit of the stochastic model, play a key role. We show that under suitable conditions this dynamical system has a unique fixed point. This result allows us to study stability properties of the underlying stochastic model. We show that as N \\rightarrow \\infty, the stochastic system is well approximated by the dynamical system, uniformly over time. As a consequence, for an arbitrarily initialized system, as N\\rightarrow \\infty and n \\rightarrow \\infty, the potential field and the empirical measure of the interacting particles are shown to converge to the unique fixed point of the dynamical system. In general, simulation of such interacting Markovian systems is a computationally daunting task. We propose a particle based approximation for the dynamic potential field which allows for a numerically tractable simulation scheme. It is shown that this simulation scheme well approximates the true physical system, uniformly over an infinite time horizon."

We perform the sensitivity analysis to determine the model robustness to parameter values. That is to help us to know the parameters that are most influential in determining disease dynamics. The model is extended by reformulating the model as an optimal control problem, with the use of five time dependent controls, to assess the impact of vaccination combined with treatment, individual protection and vector control strategies (killing adult vectors, reduction of eggs and larvae). By using optimal control theory, we establish optimal conditions under which the disease can be eradicated and we examine the impact of a possible combined control tools on the disease transmission. The Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal control.

I still do. I'm afraid if I end up in a relationship again or find new friends, I'll end up leeching off them again to attain my self worth. This can become quite overbearing on the other person (one reason why the relationship started to fall apart).\n\nI realised the key is to develop this self worth and self esteem from within yourself. This way I wouldn't need to rely upon somoene who's higher up on the social ladder than me to drag me along. But this seems easier said than done... Being a recluse and not having many friends to hang around with doesn't help either. It's like a vicious circle. I don't have many friends to build up my social skills, I don't have good social skills to make proper friends, I feel lonely with rock bottom self esteem and confidence because I suck so much at talking to people and forming any connection with them, I suck so much because I don't have many social interractions which can help me get better at this skill etc...\ndogger6: Learn new skills, experience new things.\n\nThe \"social ladder\" isn't a thing; we're all sharing the same societies and we all contribute equally towards their rules and sanctions.\nladyhaly: \nI was about to say this. The social ladder isn't a thing, and if someone thinks it is, then socialising with people is then equated to social climbing. An ulterior motive forms, which of course can make someone an unpleasant person to be around. You end up not treating people as people but as a resource. As another wrung in the ladder to step on and get higher. That's not a pleasant image at all.\n\nI agree about learning new skills, experiencing new things. Could be anything. Reading a new book, exploring various places where you live... Saving up for a trip out of town. Hiking in a well known trail. Learning the basics of photography. Training to run a 5k. Watching a new movie. Watching a series in Netflix. Volunteering at a soup kitchen. Learning how to cook a new dish. Learning how to bake a new dish. You could also look at what local events are coming up where you live and attend them. \n"

This fluff paper, published in a fucking geography journal, is about outrage over something that enough real people are outraged about that this article will probably be trending all over tumblr. It's also an example of Poe's Law. Who the hell will that inspire? SJWs, that's who. \n\nNo, gender studies is not a science. It's not even qualified to be a social science. At least sociology and political science relies on data crunching statistics. Yes, it's still a joke of a field. This paper is so stupid it doesn't even qualify for an Ig Nobel prize. The fact that this paper was probably written thanks to a government grant is infuriating. \n\nI have no respect for someone who spent $30,000+ on a degree good for nothing other than teaching gender studies.

We find good agreement with the optical and photoemission spectra, with the crystal-field splittings and orbital polarizations recently measured for the titanates, and with the metallization volume for LaTiO3. The metallization volume for YTiO3 is predicted. Using super-exchange theory, we reproduce the observed magnetic orders in LaTiO3 and YTiO3, but the results are sensitive to detail, in particular for YTiO3 which, without the Jahn-Teller distortion, would be AFM C- or A-type, rather than FM. Finally, we show that it possible to unfold the orthorhombic t2g LDA bandstructure to a pseudocubic zone. In this zone, the lowest band is separated from the two others by a direct gap and has a width, W_I, which is significantly smaller than that, W, of the entire t2g band. The progressive GdFeO3-type distortion favours electron localization by decreasing W, by increasing the splitting of the t2g levels and by decreasing W_I. Our conclusions concerning the roles of GdFeO3-type and JT distortions agree with those of Mochizuki and Imada [2]."

Do I use a water-based stain or a wax stain? Is there a pro and con for that?\n2) I'm having a hard time sanding the details. I used a random orbital to lightly scuff off the paint so far. I know some people are bristling at that, but whatever. What's done is done and I'm happy with it so far. But how do I get inside those crevaces? I tried just sandpaper, but it's a bitch and a half and seems to do nothing.\n3) What the hell is the hard top of this furniture made of. If I paint it, am I going to have a problem later on?\n4) Should I even bother staining? Any personal opinions on it?\ncaddis789: It looks like the top of it is laminate (like what is often used in kitchen cabinets). You rarely get good results painting it. The paint won't adhere well. Maybe if you sanded it lightly, you could get an oil based paint to stick to it. Stain won't do anything to it. It might be worth trying, since you wanted to paint the top anyway. If you look up at the top from inside the cabinet, you should be able to see whether it is a solid wood top or particle board. If it's wood, you might think about removing the laminate and sanding it. The laminate will come off with a heat gun (you can rent one) of even a dry hot iron.\n\nAs for the body, there are some chemical strippers that would make the crevices easier, but they're still a pain in the ass. You would then hand sand after the stripper to get the last remnants off. The wood looks like birch or beech, if you like the look of the stain, go for it.\n\nedit: I've never used a water based stain, only oil stains. They're pretty easy to use. After sanding, brush and wipe off all dust, wipe on the stain with a rag (wear gloves), wait a few minutes and then wipe off the excess. When you're wiping off the stain you can rub it in to blend any uneven spots. You shouldn't need a conditioner or pre-treatment for hardwood. For finish, I prefer oil based polyurethane over water based (just my preference) and choose between satin or gloss.\nSenorWeird: I wasn't planning on staining the top, just paint. If I sand it, then use an oil-based bonding primer before painting and then coating it with polycrylic, shouldn't that prevent it from any peeling or not adhering? If you look at the last picture, I'm pretty sure that is solid wood underneath. Guess I'll have to rent a heat gun and give it a try.\n\nI never thought of trying a stripper on the crevices. I might just give that a go. Thanks!\nHollaberra: You can use a dremmel tool with the conical bit for detail work. You can also paint laminate. Pinterest is full of bloggers who have used a paint+primer to paint laminate furniture with great success.\n\nEdited to add: you can always stain the base and then get a small artist paint brush and use the same white as the top to paint out the details that are still yellow. Just an alternative.\n"

The example illustrates the general formulas and the ease of calculations, while the McMC assessments demonstrate the numerical validity of the $p$-values as percentage position of a data point.

This method relies on a multivariate extension of the classical generalized linear mixed model where a mixture distribution is additionally assumed for random effects. We base the inference on a Bayesian specification of the model and simulation-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology. To apply the method in practice, we have prepared ready-to-use software for use in R (http://www.R-project.org). We also discuss evaluation of uncertainty in the classification and also discuss usage of a recently proposed methodology for model comparison - the selection of a number of clusters in our case - based on the penalized posterior deviance proposed by Plummer [Biostatistics 9 (2008) 523-539]."

It is shown that for many relevant parametric PDEs, the parametric smoothness of this map is typically holomorphic and also highly anisotropic in that the relevant parameters are of widely varying importance in describing the solution. These two properties are then exploited to establish convergence rates of $n$-term approximations to the solution map for which each term is separable in the parametric and physical variables. These results reveal that, at least on a theoretical level, the solution map can be well approximated by discretizations of moderate complexity, thereby showing how the curse of dimensionality is broken. This theoretical analysis is carried out through concepts of approximation theory such as best $n$-term approximation, sparsity, and $n$-widths. These notions determine a priori the best possible performance of numerical methods and thus serve as a benchmark for concrete algorithms. The second part of this article turns to the development of numerical algorithms based on the theoretically established sparse separable approximations. The numerical methods studied fall into two general categories. The first uses polynomial expansions in terms of the parameters to approximate the solution map. The second one searches for suitable low dimensional spaces for simultaneously approximating all members of the parametric family. The numerical implementation of these approaches is carried out through adaptive and greedy algorithms. An a priori analysis of the performance of these algorithms establishes how well they meet the theoretical benchmarks."

However, when the simultaneous Aramaic interpretation fell into disuse, the recitation of Akdamut remained between the first and second Hebrew verses, where it no longer seemed an appropriate interruption, so it was relocated to before the commencement of the Torah reading.\nIn most synagogues it is read responsively: the baal keriah (Torah reader) singing two verses, and the congregation responding with the next two verses. Although it is considered \"Judaism's best-known and most beloved piyyut\", there are some synagogues where it is not recited.\nIts adoption into the regular liturgy took some time; it is not mentioned as part of the Shavuot liturgy until the first decade of the 15th century and the earliest prayerbook to contain it was published in 1557.  Some say that it replaced an earlier piyyut, Arkin Moshe, which was a folkloric poem describing the excitement among the angels when  God brought Moses up to Heaven to receive the Ten Commandments, but both piyyutim appear alongside each other in many manuscripts and printed machzorim. The adoption of Akdamut into the liturgy may have been assisted by a folktale that connected its composition with a miraculous event involving the defeat of an evil sorcerer monk who was using magic to kill countless Jews."

Measurements of replication parameters ( ori/ter ratio, C period and fork speed) and of the pyruvate kinase activity showed that PykA mutants exhibit replication defects resulting from side chain modifications in the PykA protein rather than from a reduction of its metabolic activity. Interestingly, Cat and PEPut have distinct commitments in replication: while Cat impacts positively and negatively replication fork speed, PEPut stimulates initiation through a process depending on Cat-PEPut interaction and growth conditions. Residues binding to PEP and ADP in Cat, stabilizing the Cat-PEPut interaction and belonging to the TSH motif of PEPut were found important for the commitment of PykA in replication. In vitro , PykA affects the activities of replication enzymes (the polymerase DnaE, helicase DnaC and primase DnaG) essential for initiation and elongation and genetically linked to pykA . Our results thus connect replication initiation and elongation to CCM metabolites (PEP, ATP and ADP), critical Cat and PEPut residues and to multiple links between PykA and the replication enzymes DnaE, DnaC and DnaG. We propose that PykA is endowed with a moonlighting activity that senses the concentration of signaling metabolites and interacts with replication enzymes to convey information on the cellular metabolic state to the replication machinery and adjust replication initiation and elongation to metabolism. This defines a new type of replication regulator proposed to be part of the metabolic control that gates replication in the cell cycle."

Cellularized type I collagen-based hydrogels were also used to study nanoparticles behavior in 3D biomimetic environments. Results: The as-established nanoplatforms can enter HeLa cells, leading to the dissociation of the MnO2 nanosheets into Mn 2+ that enhanced T1 magnetic resonance signals and concomitantly release doxorubicin, both effects being markedly more significant than in the presence of NHDFs. Moreover, particles functionality and specificity were preserved when the cells were immobilized within type I collagen-based fibrillar hydrogels. Conclusion: The use of MnO2 nanosheets as glutathione-sensitive coatings of drug loaded nanoparticles together with surface conjugation with a targeting aptamer offers an effective strategy to obtain efficient and specific nanotheranostic systems for cancer research, both in 2D and 3D.

Our results evidence that the aggregates passively diffuse within the cell, with diffusion constants that depend on their size in agreement with the Stokes-Einstein law. However, the aggregate displacements along the cell long axis are confined to a region that roughly corresponds to the nucleoid-free space in the cell pole, thus confirming the importance of increased macromolecular crowding in the nucleoids. We thus used 3d individual-based modeling to show that these three ingredients (diffusion, aggregation and diffusion hindrance in the nucleoids) are sufficient and necessary to reproduce the available experimental data on aggregate localization in the cells. Taken together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the localization of aging-related protein aggregates in the poles of E. coli results from the coupling of passive diffusion- aggregation with spatially non-homogeneous macromolecular crowding. They further support the importance of \"soft\" intracellular structuring (based on macromolecular crowding) in diffusion-based protein localization in E. coli."

Consequently, we make use of results for $U$-statistics and apply them to the covariance matrix. By probabilistically bounding the distortion of the covariance matrix, we can apply Weyl's theorem to bound the distortion of the precision matrix, yielding a conservative, but sound test threshold for a much wider class of distributions than considered in previous works. The resulting test enables one to answer with statistical significance whether an edge is present in the graph, and convergence results are known for a wide range of distributions. The computational complexities is linear in the sample size enabling the application of the test to large data samples for which computation time becomes a limiting factor. We experimentally validate the correctness and scalability of the test on multivariate distributions for which the distributional assumptions of competing tests result in underestimates of the false positive ratio. By contrast, the proposed test remains sound, promising to be a useful tool for hypothesis testing for diverse real-world problems."

We illustrate the effectiveness of this method by computing the decomposition of a $15 \\times 15$ matrix having eigenvalues of multiplicity 3 which are not computable exactly. We also discuss the other classical method, based on the chinese remainder theorem, which gives the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition under the form $u=q(u) +[u-q(u)],$ with $q(u)$ absolutely semi-simple, $u-q(u)$ nilpotent, where $q$ is any solution of a system of congruence equations related to the roots of a polynomial $p\\in k[x]$ such that $p(u)=0.$ It is indeed possible to compute $q$ without knowing the roots of $p$ by applying the algorithm discussed above to $\\pi(x),$ where $\\pi: k[x] \\to k[x]/pk[x]$ is the canonical surjection. We obtain this way after 2 iterations the polynomial $q$ of degree 14 associated to the $15\\times 15$ matrix mentioned above. We justify by historical considerations the use of the name \"Jordan-Chevalley decomposition\", instead of the name \"Dunford decomposition\" which also appears in the literature, and we discuss multiplicative versions of this decomposition in semi-simple Lie groups. We conclude this paper showing why this decomposition should play a central role in a linear algebra course, even at a rather elementary level. Our arguments are based on a teaching experience of more than 10 years in an engineering school located on the Basque Coast."

This code is also used to compute the dispersion of the particle numbers (e.g., widths of fragment mass and charge distributions) from TDHF transfer probabilities, on the one hand, and using the Balian-Veneroni variational principle, on the other hand. A first application to test QED is discussed. Collision times in $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U are computed to determine the optimum energy for the observation of the vacuum decay. It is shown that the initial orientation strongly affects the collision times and reaction mechanism. The highest collision times predicted by TDHF in this reaction are of the order of $\\sim4$ zs at a center of mass energy of 1200 MeV. According to modern calculations based on the Dirac equation, the collision times at $E_{cm}>1$ GeV are sufficient to allow spontaneous electron-positron pair emission from QED vacuum decay, in case of bare uranium ion collision. A second application of actinide collisions to produce neutron-rich transfermiums is discussed. A new inverse quasifission mechanism associated to a specific orientation of the nuclei is proposed to produce transfermium nuclei ($Z>100$) in the collision of prolate deformed actinides such as $^{232}$Th+$^{250}$Cf. The collision of the tip of one nucleus with the side of the other results in a nucleon flux toward the latter. The probability distributions for transfermium production in such a collision are computed. The produced nuclei are more neutron-rich than those formed in fusion reactions, thus, leading to more stable isotopes closer to the predicted superheavy island of stability. In addition to mass and charge dispersion, the Balian-Veneroni variational principle is used to compute correlations between $Z$ and $N$ distributions, which are zero in standard TDHF calculations."

We aim to make a more interpretable VAE by partitioning the representation layer into disjoint sets of units. Partitioning the representation layer into disjoint sets of interconnected units yields a prior that features of the input space to this new VAE, which we call a partition VAE or PVAE, are grouped together by correlation -- for example, if our image space were the space of all ping ping game images (a somewhat complex image space we use to test our architecture) then we would hope the partitions in the representation layer each learned some large feature of the image like the characteristics of the ping pong table or the characteristics and position of the players or the ball. We also add to the PVAE a cost-saving measure: subresolution. Because we do not have access to GPU training environments for long periods of time and Google Colab Pro costs money, we attempt to decrease the complexity of the PVAE by outputting an image with dimensions scaled down from the input image by a constant factor, thus forcing the model to output a smaller version of the image. We then increase the resolution to calculate loss and train by interpolating through neighboring pixels. We train a tuned PVAE on MNIST and Sports10 to test its effectiveness."

In order to separate the vacuum vessel pressure from the cryostat waveguide pressure, forty eight 5 GHz 500kW CW windows are to be assembled on the waveguides at the equatorial port flange. For nuclear safety reasons, forty eight additional windows could be located in the cryostat section, to separate and monitor the cryostat waveguide pressure from the exterior transmission line pressure. These windows are identified as being one of the main critical components for the ITER LHCD system since first ITER LHCD studies [1] [2] [3] or more recently [4] [5] , and clearly require an important R\\&D effort. In this context and even if the LHCD system is not part of the construction baseline, the CEA/IRFM is conducting a R\\&D effort in order to validate a design and the performances of these RF windows. In order to begin the assessment of this need, two 5 GHz 500 kW/5 s pill-box type windows prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company in close collaboration with the CEA/IRFM [6]. The section 2 of this paper reports the RF and mechanical design of a 5 GHz window. Some features of the mechanical design and the experimental RF measurements at low power are reported in section 3. High power results, made in collaboration with NFRI, are detailed in section 4. The development of CW windows is discussed in the conclusion. 2-RF AND MECHANICAL DESIGN The proposed 5 GHz RF window is based on a pill-box design [2] , i.e. a ceramic brazed in portion of a circular waveguide, connected on either side to a rectangular waveguide section. Typical design rules of thumb of such device are circular section diameter about the same size of the diagonal of the rectangular waveguide (cf. FIGURE 1). Without taking into account the ceramic, the circular section length is approximately half a guided wavelength of the circular TE 11 mode, in order for the device to act as a half-wave transformer. Once optimized, taking into account the ceramic, matching is correct only for a narrow band of frequency and is very sensitive to the device dimensions and the ceramic relative permittivity. The heat losses in the ceramic, which have to be extracted by an active water cooling, depends on the inside electric field topology and of ceramic dielectric loss (loss tangent).

Compared to the existing LS-TD(lambda) algorithm, RLS-TD(lambda) has advantages in computation and is more suitable for online learning. The effectiveness of RLS-TD(lambda) is analyzed and verified by learning prediction experiments of Markov chains with a wide range of parameter settings. The Fast-AHC algorithm is derived by applying the proposed RLS-TD(lambda) algorithm in the critic network of the adaptive heuristic critic method. Unlike conventional AHC algorithm, Fast-AHC makes use of RLS methods to improve the learning-prediction efficiency in the critic. Learning control experiments of the cart-pole balancing and the acrobot swing-up problems are conducted to compare the data efficiency of Fast-AHC with conventional AHC. From the experimental results, it is shown that the data efficiency of learning control can also be improved by using RLS methods in the learning-prediction process of the critic. The performance of Fast-AHC is also compared with that of the AHC method using LS-TD(lambda). Furthermore, it is demonstrated in the experiments that different initial values of the variance matrix in RLS-TD(lambda) are required to get better performance not only in learning prediction but also in learning control. The experimental results are analyzed based on the existing theoretical work on the transient phase of forgetting factor RLS methods."

Approach: In this paper, we present a novel approach for tool reuse that aims to improve the experience with regard to working with multiple high-level dynamic, object-oriented programming languages. As part of this, we build a multi-language virtual execution environment and reuse Smalltalk's live programming tools for other languages. Knowledge: An important part of our approach is to retrofit and align runtime capabilities for different languages as it is a requirement for providing consistent tools. Furthermore, it provides convenient means to reuse and even mix software libraries and frameworks written in different languages without breaking tool support. Grounding: The prototype system Squimera is an implementation of our approach and demonstrates that it is possible to reuse both development tools from a live programming system to improve the development experience as well as software artifacts from different languages to increase productivity. Importance: In the domain of polyglot programming systems, most research has focused on the integration of different languages and corresponding performance optimizations. Our work, on the other hand, focuses on tooling and the overall programming experience."

We conclude that the superregular clouds, which are found in the {\\it exact} extremal scenario ($a = M$), are not continuously connected with the regular ones in the limit of extremality $(a\\rightarrow M)$. Remarkably, the spectrum leading to the existence of the radial part of the full solution of these superregular clouds (which obeys a Teukolsky equation) is given by the exact formula $M=a=\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\sqrt{m^2 + \\left[-\\kappa+\\sqrt{\\kappa^2+m^2}\\,\\right]^2}$, which depends on three (positive) integers: the principal number $n$, the {\\it magnetic number} $m$, and an integer $j$, related with the {\\it type} of regularity at the horizon. Here $\\kappa= j +n$, and $\\mu$ is the mass associated with $\\Psi$. This spectrum depends implicitly on the {\\it orbital} number $l$, an integer number that determines the existence of well behaved spheroidal harmonics which are associated with the angular part of the cloud solution. Since the separation constants that are obtained from the superregularity conditions in the radial part of the solution do {\\it not} coincide in general with the standard separation constants required for the spheroidal harmonics to be well behaved on the axis of symmetry, we conclude that non-trivial boson clouds having such superregularity conditions cannot exist in the background of an exact extremal Kerr BH. The only exception to this conclusion is in the limit $n\\rightarrow \\infty$ and $m\\ll n$. In such a large $n$ limit consistency in the separation constants leads to a quadratic Diophantine equation of Pell's type for the integer numbers $(l,m)$. Such Pell's equation can be readily solved using standard techniques. In that instance well behaved spheroidal harmonics are obtained, and thus, well behaved non-trivial superregular clouds can be computed. Of course, this situation, does not preclude the existence of other kind of smooth cloud solutions for any other $n$, not necessarily large (e.g. clouds with a non-integer $\\kappa$) when using a better behaved coordinate system at the horizon (e.g. Wheeler's tortoise coordinate or proper radial distance)."

How does the One Leg variation you are referring to look like? Would you keep the second leg tucked in or slightly out like an Advance Tuck?\n[deleted]: Both are easier than straddle and half lay. I usually keep one leg tucked when doing one legged\n\nI have OG and ive seen the charts but i have no idea what he was thinking when writing that. Other than that the book is very well written. \n\nIts: tuck, adv tuck, one leg, straddle, half lay, full for planche, front lever and back lever\nEveryNameTakenFml: One Leg with a leg tucked in has become a very controversial progression. As you already extend One Leg it creates the illusion that you are really close the to full progression even though that is actually not the case. Usually, when someone is talking about the One Leg Progression they mean that you extend the other leg just like in an Advance Tuck Position, which on the other hand is actually really hard and much closer to the full progression. The reason for that if I am not wrong is that when you tuck one leg in you are actually rounding your back just like in the normal tuck variation and hence create an overall shorter lever and making the exercise easier. That and the fact the the exercise gets obviously harder as you keep on extending the other leg. I am not sure on which progression you currently are but you might as well try both next time and see the difference for yourself. Also, my reply might appear a little harsh, which is why I want to assure that this isn\u2018t supposed to be the case. Just want to clarify why the One Leg progression is actually that hard. :D\n[deleted]: I can do a full planche\n\nBut yes i know what you mean, straightening out the lower back does push the tucked leg out a bit thus making it harder but still easier than a straddle \n\nIll try and film some progressions for you tomorrow\n\nEdit: i didnt take it as harsh, i understand what you mean\n"

I feel gaming falls outside this category and more into sports or entertainment.\nBonzoTheBoss: With equal respect, I disagree with your definition of \"hobby.\" To me, at least, it is simply anything done during your leisure time for entertainment. That does certainly include the more \"hands on\" hobbies that you describe, but I do not think that it needs to have a physical outcome in order to be considered a hobby.\n\nFor example, I would classify reading as a hobby, but that has no \"physical\" outcome, rather just the satisfaction of a completed book.\n\nI also wouldn't say that a hobby needs to be a solitary pursuit. Why just recently I attended a beekeepers society event, where amateur beekeepers from around the county gathered to show off their wares and have them judged. All in good spirit, of course, but there was definitely a sense of friendly competition.\n\nSo, with all that in mind I wouldn't say that gaming was any less of a hobby than reading when it comes to physical outcomes, and no less a hobby for playing with others than beekeeping. There are, of course, those who choose to play single-player games exclusively, and those who never attend a beekeeping event but I would not say that their individual activities are any \"more\" (or less) of a hobby that those who interact with others.\n\nMy point, to reiterate, was more that whereas previously I might hop on for a few friendly rounds and have fun regardless of my performance the friendly competition and winning were secondary to the enjoyment of the match. Obviously I prefer to win but if I had fun it didn't really matter if I lost. These days it seems like the only reason people seem to play is to win, and any lack of performance (real or perceived) is ridiculed and insulted in most toxic fashions.\nasinine_qualities: &gt; simply anything done during your leisure time for entertainment\n\nI would expand this a bit. A hobby should also involve a fair amount of trial-and-error, learning, failing, figuring stuff out, getting better and mastery. I don\u2019t believe a hobby is limited to entertainment, because then it becomes a product that\u2019s passively enjoyed, like a book, it\u2019s readymade with the purpose of entertaining the reader. Still, I\u2019m not familiar with online gaming so cannot comment on whether these are aspects of it.\n\n"

Our approach includes a spatial point process for the animal activity centers and uses the spatial correlation in counts as information about the number and location of the activity centers. Camera-traps, hair snares, track plates, sound recordings, and even point counts can yield spatially correlated count data, and thus our model is widely applicable. A simulation study demonstrated that while the posterior mean exhibits frequentist bias on the order of 5-10% in small samples, the posterior mode is an accurate point estimator as long as adequate spatial correlation is present. Marking a subset of the population substantially increases posterior precision and is recommended whenever possible. We applied our model to avian point count data collected on an unmarked population of the northern parula (Parula americana) and obtained a density estimate (posterior mode) of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.19-1.64) birds/ha.

This \"Giant Pool of Money\" increased as savings from high-growth developing nations entered global capital markets. Investors searching for higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds sought alternatives globally.\nThe temptation offered by such readily available savings overwhelmed the policy and regulatory control mechanisms in country after country, as lenders and borrowers put these savings to use, generating bubble after bubble across the globe. While these bubbles have burst, causing asset prices (e.g., housing and commercial property) to decline, the liabilities owed to global investors remain at full price, generating questions regarding the solvency of governments and their banking systems.\nHow each European country involved in this crisis borrowed and invested the money varies. For example, Ireland's banks lent the money to property developers, generating a massive property bubble. When the bubble burst, Ireland's government and taxpayers assumed private debts. In Greece, the government increased its commitments to public workers in the form of extremely generous wage and pension benefits, with the former doubling in real terms over 10 years. Iceland's banking system grew enormously, creating debts to global investors (external debts) several times GDP.The interconnection in the global financial system means that if one nation defaults on its sovereign debt or enters into recession putting some of the external private debt at risk, the banking systems of creditor nations face losses. For example, in October 2011, Italian borrowers owed French banks $366 billion (net). Should Italy be unable to finance itself, the French banking system and economy could come under significant pressure, which in turn would affect France's creditors and so on.\nThis is referred to as financial contagion. Another factor contributing to interconnection is the concept of debt protection. Institutions entered into contracts called credit default swaps (CDS) that result in payment should default occur on a particular debt instrument (including government issued bonds).\nBut, since multiple CDSs can be purchased on the same security, it is unclear what exposure each country's banking system now has to CDS.Greece hid its growing debt and deceived EU officials with the help of derivatives designed by major banks.\nAlthough some financial institutions clearly profited from the growing Greek government debt in the short run, there was a long lead-up to the crisis.\nThe European bailouts are largely about shifting exposure from banks and others, who otherwise are lined up for losses on the sovereign debt they have piled up, onto European taxpayers."

We also estimate a salamander population of known size from laboratory experiments evaluating the effectiveness of a marking technique commonly used for amphibians and fish. Our model was able to reliably estimate the size of this population and provided evidence of individual heterogeneity in misidentification probability that is attributable to variable mark quality. Our approach is more computationally demanding than previously proposed methods, but it provides the flexibility necessary for a much broader suite of models to be explored while properly accounting for uncertainty introduced by misidentification and imperfect detection. In the absence of misidentification, our probit formulation also provides a convenient and efficient Gibbs sampler for Bayesian analysis of traditional closed population capture-recapture data."

We study the influence on the abundances of these species of parameters specific to chemistry (density, UV field, and CR ionisation rate) and those linked to turbulence (the average turbulent dissipation rate, the dissipation timescale, and the ion neutral velocity drift in the regions of dissipation). Results. The most sensitive tracers of turbulent dissipation are the abundances of CH+ and SH+, and the column densities of the J = 3, 4, 5 rotational levels of H2 . The abundances of CO, HCO+, and the intensity of the 158 $\\mu$m [CII] emission line are significantly enhanced by turbulent dissipation. The vast diversity of chemical pathways allows the independent determinations of free parameters never estimated before: an upper limit to the average turbulent dissipation rate, $\\overline{\\varepsilon}$ < 10$^{-23}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ for $n_H$=20 cm$^{-3}$, from the CH+ abundance; an upper limit to the ion-neutral velocity drift, $u_{in}$ < 3.5 km s$^{-1}$, from the SH+ to CH+ abundance ratio; and a range of dissipation timescales, 100 < $\\tau_V$ < 1000 yr, from the CO to HCO+ abundance ratio. For the first time, we reproduce the large abundances of CO observed on diffuse lines of sight, and we show that CO may be abundant even in regions with UV-shieldings as low as $5 \\times 10^{-3}$ mag. The best range of parameters also reproduces the abundance ratios of OH, C2H, and H2O to HCO+ and are consistent with the known properties of the turbulent cascade in the Galactic diffuse ISM. Conclusions. Our results disclose an unexpected link between the dissipation of turbulence and the emergence of molecular richness in the diffuse ISM. Some species, such as CH+ or SH+, turn out to be unique tracers of the energy trail in the ISM. In spite of some degeneracy, the properties of the turbulent cascade, down to dissipation, can be captured through specific molecular abundances."

This estimator is constructed as an l0-penalized estimator among a sequence of Lasso estimators associated to a dyadic sequence of growing truncated dictionaries. The selection procedure automatically chooses the best level of truncation of the dictionary so as to make the best tradeoff between approximation, l1-regularization and sparsity. From a theoretical point of view, we shall provide an oracle inequality satisfied by this selected Lasso estimator. The oracle inequalities established for the Lasso and the selected Lasso estimators shall enable us to derive rates of convergence on a wide class of functions, showing that these estimators perform at least as well as greedy algorithms. Besides, we shall prove that the rates of convergence achieved by the selected Lasso estimator are optimal in the orthonormal case by bounding from below the minimax risk on some Besov bodies. Finally, some theoretical results about the performance of the Lasso for infinite uncountable dictionaries will be studied in the specific framework of neural networks. All the oracle inequalities presented in this paper are obtained via the application of a single general theorem of model selection among a collection of nonlinear models which is a direct consequence of the Gaussian concentration inequality. The key idea that enables us to apply this general theorem is to see l1-regularization as a model selection procedure among l1-balls."

This is done first in an abstract Hamiltonian framework, which encompasses a number of dispersive models, in particular the well-known (generalized) Korteweg--de Vries equation, and the less known Euler--Korteweg system, in both Eulerian coordinates and Lagrangian coordinates. The latter is itself an abstract framework for several models arising in water waves theory, superfluidity, and quantum hydrodynamics. As regards its application to compressible capillary fluids, attention is paid here to untangle the interplay between traveling waves/modulation equations in Eulerian coordinates and those in Lagrangian coordinates. In the most general setting, it is proved that the hyperbolicity of modulated equations is indeed necessary for the spectral stability of periodic traveling waves. This extends earlier results by Serre [Comm. Partial Differential Equations 2005], Oh and Zumbrun [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 2003], and Johnson, Zumbrun and Bronski [Phys. D 2010]. In addition, reduced necessary conditions are obtained in the small amplitude limit. Then numerical investigations are carried out for the modulated equations of the Euler--Korteweg system with two types of 'pressure' laws, namely the quadratic law of shallow water equations, and the nonmonotone van der Waals pressure law. Both the evolutionarity and the hyperbolicity of the modulated equations are tested, and regions of modulational instability are thus exhibited."

The one above 13 clusters disappears when noise is added, while the classification with 12 clusters is very robust against noise down to a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 3. At SNR=1, the optimum is 5 clusters, but the classification is still compatible with the previous one. The distribution of the parameters used for the simulation shows an excellent discrimination between classes. A higher dispersion both in the spectra within each class and in the parameter distribution, leads us to conclude that despite a much higher ICL, the classification with more than 13 clusters in the noiseless case is not physically relevant. Conclusions. This study yields two conclusions valid at least for the Fisher-EM algorithm. Firstly, the unsupervised classification of spectra of galaxies is both reliable and robust to noise. Secondly, such analyses are able to extract the useful physical information contained in the spectra and to build highly meaningful classifications. In an epoch of data-driven astrophysics, it is important to trust unsupervised machine learning approaches that do not require training samples which are unavoidably biased."

The new formulation is both more general and simpler: the two operations for composing graphs used in the previous work can now be obtained from a single operation by fixing the semiring parameter to zero and one, respectively. By instantiating the new data type with different semirings, and working out laws for interpreting the resulting expression trees, we discover an unusual algebraic structure, which we call \"united monoids\", that is, a pair of monoids whose unit elements coincide. We believe that it is worth studying united monoids in their full generality, going beyond the graphs which prompted their discovery. To that end, we characterise united monoids with a minimal set of axioms, prove a few basic theorems, and discuss several notable examples. We validate the presented approach by implementing it in the open-source *algebraic-graphs* library. Our theoretical contributions are supported by proofs that are included in the paper and have also been machine-checked in Agda. By extending algebraic graphs with support for edge labels, we make them suitable for a much larger class of possible applications. By studying united monoids, we provide a theoretical foundation for further research in this area."

The average arrhythmia prediction performances of the ad-hoc classifier are NPV = 77% $\\pm$ 13% and PPV = 31% $\\pm$ 19% (Negative Predictive Value $\\pm$ std, Positive Predictive Value $\\pm$ std). According to our study, improving prophylactic ICD-implantation candidate selection by automatic classification from ECG features may be possible, but the availability of a sizable dataset appears to be essential to decrease the number of False Negatives."

The spatial distribution of magnetic intensity is highly heterogeneous, and a stark dynamical contrast exists between the interior and the exterior of the tangent cylinder (the cylinder parallel to the axis of rotation that circumscribes the inner core).In the interior, the magnetic field is strongest, and is associated with a vigorous twisted polar vortex, whose dynamics may occasionally lead to the formation of a reverse polar flux patch at the surface of the shell. Furthermore, the strong magnetic field also allows accumulation of light material within the tangent cylinder, leading to stable stratification there. Torsional Alfv{\\'e}n waves are frequently triggered in the vicinity of the tangent cylinder and propagate towards the equator.Outside the tangent cylinder, the magnetic field inhibits the growth of zonal winds and the kinetic energy is mostly non-zonal. Spatio-temporal analysis indicates that the low-frequency, non-zonal flow is quite geostrophic (columnar) and predominantly large-scale: an m=1 eddy spontaneously emerges in our most extreme simulations, without any heterogeneous boundary forcing.Our spatio-temporal analysis further reveals that (i) the low-frequency, large-scale flow is governed by a balance between Coriolis and buoyancy forces -- magnetic field and flow tend to align, minimizing the Lorentz force; (ii) the high-frequency flow obeys a balance between magnetic and Coriolis forces; (iii) the convective plumes mostly live at an intermediate scale, whose dynamics is driven by a 3-term 1 MAC balance -- involving Coriolis, Lorentz and buoyancy forces. However, small-scale (E^{1/3}) quasi-geostrophic convection is still observed in the regions of low magnetic intensity."

This transformation is where the methodological challenges of data valuation lie, both for practitioners and for academic researchers. Considerations on the methods applicable to take advantage of the possibilities offered by these massive data are relatively recent, and often highlight the disruptive aspect of the current ''data deluge'' to point out that this evolution would be the source of a revival of empiricism in a ''fourth paradigm'' based on the intensive and ''agnostic'' exploitation of massive amounts of data in order to bring out new knowledge, following a purely inductive logic. Although we do not adopt this speculative point of view, it is clear that data-driven approaches are scarce in quantitative HRM studies. However, there are well-established methods, particularly in the field of data mining, which are based on inductive approaches. This area of quantitative analysis with an inductive aim is still relatively unexplored in HRM ( apart from typological analyses). The objective of this paper is first to give an overview of data driven methods that can be used for HRM research, before proposing an empirical illustration which consists in an exploratory research combining a latent profile analysis and an exploration by Gaussian graphical models."

As a result, the same influence diagram can be used to build, assess and analyze a model, facilitating changes in the formulation and feedback from sensitivity analysis. The goal in this paper is to determine arbitrary conditional probability distributions from a given probabilistic model. Given qualitative information about the dependence of the random variables in the model we can, for a specific conditional expression, specify precisely what quantitative information we need to be able to determine the desired conditional probability distribution. It is also shown how we can find that probability distribution by performing operations locally, that is, over subspaces of the joint distribution. In this way, we can exploit the conditional independence present in the model to avoid having to construct or manipulate the full joint distribution. These results are extended to include maximal processing when the information available is incomplete, and optimal decision making in an uncertain environment. Influence diagrams as a computer-aided modeling tool were developed by Miller, Merkofer, and Howard [5] and extended by Howard and Matheson [2]. Good descriptions of how to use them in modeling are in Owen [7] and Howard and Matheson [2]. The notion of solving a decision problem through influence diagrams was examined by Olmsted [6] and such an algorithm was developed by Shachter [8]. The latter paper also shows how influence diagrams can be used to perform a variety of sensitivity analyses. This paper extends those results by developing a theory of the properties of the diagram that are used by the algorithm, and the information needed to solve arbitrary probability inference problems. Section 2 develops the notation and the framework for the paper and the relationship between influence diagrams and joint probability distributions. The general probabilistic inference problem is posed in Section 3. In Section 4 the transformations on the diagram are developed and then put together into a solution procedure in Section 5. In Section 6, this procedure is used to calculate the information requirement to solve an inference problem and the maximal processing that can be performed with incomplete information. Section 7 contains a summary of results."

Two non-vanishing polynomial terms are used when deriving the transport systems for electrons, whereas only one term is retained for heavy particles. In a simplified framework where the plasma is fully ionized, we compare the transport properties for the Sun chromosphere to conventional expressions for magnetized plasmas due to Braginskii, showing a good agreement between both results. For more general partially ionized conditions, representative of the Sun chromosphere, we compute the muticomponent transport properties corresponding to the species diffusion velocities, heavy-particle and electron heat fluxes, and viscous stress tensor of the model, for a Helium-Hydrogen mixture in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The model is assessed for the 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a pore, in the highly turbulent upper layer of the solar convective zone. The resistive term is found to dominate mainly the dynamics of the electric field at the pore location. The battery term for heavy particles appears to be higher at the pore location and at some intergranulation boundaries."

We identify and address some limitations of the original protocol and expand the analysis to a new corpus spanning seven more years of the MCR. We also present a novel static analysis tool for Java bytecode, Maracas, which provides us with: (i) the set of all BCs between two versions of a library; and (ii) the set of locations in client code impacted by individual BCs. Our key findings, derived from the analysis of 119, 879 library upgrades and 293, 817 clients, contrast with the original study and show that 83.4% of these upgrades do comply with semantic versioning. Furthermore, we observe that the tendency to comply with semantic versioning has significantly increased over time. Finally, we find that most BCs affect code that is not used by any client, and that only 7.9% of all clients are affected by BCs.

Finally, Neptune displays the greatest probability of Trojan capture, with values ranging between 10^-4 and 10^-3. Our results suggest that all four giant planets are able to capture and retain a significant population of Trojan objects from the disk by the end of planetary migration. As a result of encounters with the giant planets prior to Trojan capture, these objects tend to be captured on orbits that are spread over a wide range of orbital eccentricities and inclinations. The bulk of captured objects are to some extent dynamically unstable, and therefore the populations of these objects tend to decay over the age of the Solar System, providing an important ongoing source of new objects moving on dynamically unstable orbits among the giant planets. Given that a huge population of objects would be displaced by Neptune's outward migration (with a potential cumulative mass a number of times that of the Earth), we conclude that the surviving remnant of the Trojans captured during the migration of the outer planets might be sufficient to explain the currently known Trojan populations in the outer Solar system."

That guy never read their biographies, they had their studies paid, they could just sit there and develop their own style instead of being told how to do stuff by a master artisan.\n\nAlso this: \"The first individual in Renaissance literature was Dr. Faustus, who represented the extreme limits of greed.\"\n\nSay what? He is probably referring to Goethe's Faustus, written in the fucking 18th century. Let's cut he some slack and pretend he was thinking of Marlowe's Faustus: that wasn't the first individual of shit. The play is great and influenced Shakespeare etc., but its position in the canon isn't anywhere near that status.\nLet's cut some slack again. Is he referring to the folk story of Faustus itself? That originated in \"Germany\" (still more than 300 hundred years from existing but you know what I mean). One thing people don't get about the Renaissance is it didn't happen everywhere at once. It's not like some funny stuff happen in a couple cities of \"Italy\" (etc. etc.) and then BAM! Renaissance everywhere. In the rest of Europe nothing had changed and would continue to be the same for a century. And finally, the myth itself. Alchemist magician makes a pact with the devil, ends up getting fucked. The story of Faust is medieval mysticism at its finest.\nAnyhow, the part about how the grain-based-money economy was very productive and created wealth makes sense economically I guess, that was interesting to read. One thing pissed me though: \"They started investing in their infrastructure and their windmills and their water wheels; and also in their future in the form of cathedrals and other tourist attractions.\"\n\nCome on now, Cathedrals and other tourist attractions? Do you have to be so dismissive and disrespectful to those people's beliefs? Would he say the same about mosques in the Arab world? \"You know the Kaaba, yeah, smart move, kept the city a tourist attraction for Muslims from the whole world, very clever\"\nasshaberdashery: I agree completely. There are some interesting ideas, but it all smells like complete bullshit. It's just one outrageous assertion after another, connected by the most childish kind of logic. No evidence is offered for any of the claims, just a string of logical fallacies.\n\nWith respect to the grain-based economy - yes it's an interesting idea, but what he's saying is that deflation somehow leads to more growth, when it's well known that the opposite is true. \nsalvadors: This is pretty much all based on the his book (cited at the bottom) \u2014\u00a0he goes into more detail on all of it there.

Approach: We designed and implemented a pseudonymized, randomly-sampling telemetry system for Luau. Telemetry records include a timestamp, a session id, a reason for sending, and a numeric summary of the most recent type analyses. This information lets us study type errors over time without revealing private data. We deployed the system in Roblox Studio during Spring 2023 and collected over 1.5 million telemetry records from over 340,000 sessions. Knowledge: We present several findings about Luau, all of which suggest that telemetry is an effective way to study type error pragmatics. One of the less-surprising findings is that opt-in gradual types are unpopular: there is an 100x gap between the number of untyped Luau sessions and the number of typed ones. One surprise is that the strict mode for type analysis is overly conservative about interactions with data assets. A reassuring finding is that type analysis rarely hits its internal limits on problem size. Grounding: Our findings are supported by a dataset of over 1.5 million telemetry records. The data and scripts for analyzing it are available in an artifact. Importance: Beyond the immediate benefits to Luau, our findings about types and type errors have implications for adoption and ergonomics in other gradual languages such as TypeScript, Elixir, and Typed Racket. Our telemetry design is of broad interest, as it reports on type errors without revealing sensitive information."

This paper addresses the following question: What are the essential features for MST and LMS, and how can these be modelled with simple constructs? To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this question has been addressed. We performed a systematic analysis of the features and the constructs in MST, LMS, and the considered variants to identify the essential features. The variants are among the most influential (according to Google Scholar) and well-established systems that cover a wide set of areas in distributed, parallel programming. We used classical techniques of formal models such as BNF, structural congruence, small step operational semantics and typing judgments to build our language and type system. Lastly, the coherence of operational semantics and type system is proven by induction. This paper proposes a set of essential features, a language of structured interactions and a type theory of comprehensive multiparty session types, including global types and type system. The analysis removes overlapping features and captures the shared traits, thereby introducing the essential features. The constructs of the language are simple and fundamental, based on the $\\lambda$ and $\\pi$ calculi. Analogously, our global types reflect what is omitted and introduced in the language. Our system covers all the features of the original and variants, with a better ratio of the number of language and type constructs over the number of covered features. The features of the original, variants, and our system along with the number of constructs in the respective language and global types to model them are presented through a table. The syntax, operational semantics, meta-theory and type system of our system are given. We modelled all the motivating examples of the variants in our model, describing the reduction and typing steps. The work discusses how new features, in particular the non-essential ones (formerly excluded) and advanced ones can be either modelled atop the essential ones or added with minimal efforts, i.e. without modifying the existing ones. The fundamental properties of typed processes such as subject reduction, communication safety, and progress are established."

We then go on to explain the error in terms of the architecture definition itself and develop tools for modifying the architecture based on this explanation. This confers an unprecedented level of control on the deep learning practitioner. They can make informed design decisions before the first line of code is written, even for tasks for which no prior art exists. Our first major contribution is to show that the 'degree of nonlinearity' of a neural architecture is a key causal driver behind its performance, and a primary aspect of the architecture's model complexity. We introduce the 'nonlinearity coefficient' (NLC), a scalar metric for measuring nonlinearity. Via extensive empirical study, we show that the value of the NLC in the architecture's randomly initialized state before training is a powerful predictor of test error after training and that attaining a right-sized NLC is essential for attaining an optimal test error. The NLC is also conceptually simple, well-defined for any feedforward network, easy and cheap to compute, has extensive theoretical, empirical and conceptual grounding, follows instructively from the architecture definition, and can be easily controlled via our 'nonlinearity normalization' algorithm. We argue that the NLC is the most powerful scalar statistic for architecture design specifically and neural network analysis in general. Our analysis is fueled by mean field theory, which we use to uncover the 'meta-distribution' of layers. Beyond the NLC, we uncover and flesh out a range of metrics and properties that have a significant explanatory influence on test and training error. We go on to explain the majority of the error variation across a wide range of randomly generated architectures with these metrics and properties. We compile our insights into a practical guide for architecture designers, which we argue can significantly shorten the trial-and-error phase of deep learning deployment. Our results are grounded in an experimental protocol that exceeds that of the vast majority of other deep learning studies in terms of carefulness and rigor. We study the impact of e.g. dataset, learning rate, floating-point precision, loss function, statistical estimation error and batch inter-dependency on performance and other key properties. We promote research practices that we believe can significantly accelerate progress in architecture design research."

This emission could be generated i) by a large-scale shock, perhaps remnant of the IRDC formation process; ii) by decelerated or recently processed gas in large-scale outflows driven by 8 micron and 24 micron sources; or iii) by an undetected and widespread population of lower mass protostars. High-angular resolution observations are needed to disentangle between these three scenarios."

The mobile phase is pumped at a rate that will allow droplets to form that maximize the mass transfer of a compound between the upper and lower phases. Compounds that are more soluble in the upper phase will travel quickly through the column, while compounds that are more soluble in the stationary phase will linger. Separation occurs because different compounds distribute differently, in a ratio called the partition coefficient, between the two phases.\nThe biphasic solvent system must be carefully formulated so that it will perform appropriately in the DCCC column. The solvent system must form two phases without excess emulsification in order to form droplets. The densities of the two phases must also be sufficiently different so that the phases will move past each other in the column. Many DCCC solvent systems contain both chloroform and water. The solvent system used in the seminal publication was made from chloroform, acetic acid, and aqueous 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. Many subsequent solvents systems were made with chloroform, methanol, and water which is sometimes represented as a ChMWat solvent system. Solvent systems formulated with ''n''-butanol, water and a modifier such as acetic acid, pyridine or n-propanol have also enjoyed some success in DCCC. In some cases, non-aqueous biphasic solvent systems such as acetonitrile and methanol have been utilized.\nThe main difference between DCCC and other types of countercurrent chromatography techniques is that there is no vigorous mixing of phases to enhance the mass transfer of compounds that allows them to distribute between the two phases. In 1951 Kies and Davis described an apparatus similar to the DCCC. They created a series of open tubes that were arranged in a cascade to either drip a more dense phase through a less dense stationary phase or, conversely, a less dense phase could be introduced into the bottom of the tube to dribble through the more dense phase. In 1954, a fractionation column was introduced by Kepes the resembled a CCC column divided into chambers with perforated plastic disks. Similar DCCC-type instruments have been created by A. E. Kostanyan and collaborators which employ vertical columns that are divided into partitions with porous disks. Once the columns are filled with stationary phase, the mobile phase is pumped through, not continuously but, in pulses. The solvent motion created by a pulsed pumping action creates the mixing and settling that is common to most all forms of countercurrent chromatography."

Pharmacokinetics (PK), drug resistance and imperfect adherence to prescribed antiviral drugs are important factors explaining the resurgence of virus. To better understand the factors responsible for the virological failure, this paper develops the mechanism-based nonlinear differential equation models for characterizing long-term viral dynamics with ARV therapy. The models directly incorporate drug concentration, adherence and drug susceptibility into a function of treatment efficacy and, hence, fully integrate virologic, PK, drug adherence and resistance from an AIDS clinical trial into the analysis. A Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach in conjunction with the rescaled version of dynamic differential equations is investigated to estimate dynamic parameters and make inference. In addition, the correlations of baseline factors with estimated dynamic parameters are explored and some biologically meaningful correlation results are presented. Further, the estimated dynamic parameters in patients with virologic success were compared to those in patients with virologic failure and significantly important findings were summarized. These results suggest that viral dynamic parameters may play an important role in understanding HIV pathogenesis, designing new treatment strategies for long-term care of AIDS patients."

A statistical parametric mapping approach was performed on the force, impulse and RFD-time curves. The integrated sEMG with time at 0-30, 0-50, 0-100 and 0-200 ms time intervals relative to onset of sEMG activity was extracted and groups were compared separately for each sex. Results The cohort of 159 individuals had a median age of 69 (9 IQR) years and body mass index was 27.6 (6.2 IQR) kg/ m 2. Propensity-score-matched groups balanced CKD patients and controls by gender with 66 males and 34 females. In scalar analysis, CKD patients manifested a higher decrement than controls in the early phase of contraction, regarding the NRFD peak (P = 0.009; $\\eta$ 2 p = 0.034) and RFD 75 and RFD 100 (for both P < 0.001; $\\eta$ 2 p = 0.068 and 0.064). The onedimensional analysis confirmed that CKD males manifest higher and delayed neuromuscular fatigability, especially before 100 ms from onset of contraction. sEMG was lower in CKD patients than controls in the 0-100 ms (at rest: P = 0.049, Cohen's d = 0.458) and 0-200 ms (at rest: P = 0.016, Cohen's d = 0.496; during exercise: P = 0.006, Cohen's d = 0.421) time windows. Controls showed greater decrease of sEMG than CKD patients in the 0-30 ms (P = 0.020, Cohen's d = 0.533) and 0-50 ms (P = 0.010, Cohen's d = 0.640) time windows. As opposite to females, males showed almost the same differences between groups. Conclusions Our study is the first to show that CKD patients have higher fatigability than controls, which may be associated with an impaired motor-unit recruitment, highlighting a neural drive disturbance with CKD. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings."

The work you did, while it may eventually break down, should last plenty long enough. The wire mesh you used was a good idea and will help. Next time you should knock out as much rust as possible, seal that area with a good rust preventative paint, hell even rustoleum basic rattle can would work. Then do your body work. Rusting from the inside will eventually leave you with not much to bond to. The mesh, paint, and clear will essential be all thats holding it on after a few months/years.

Subsequently, the Abbasid caliph al-Mustansir recognized his authority in India. Over the next few years, Iltutmish suppressed a rebellion in Bengal, captured Gwalior, raided the Paramara-controlled cities of Bhilsa and Ujjain in central India, and expelled Khwarazmian subordinates in the north-west. His officers also attacked and plundered the Chandela-controlled Kalinjar area.\nIltutmish organized the administration of the Sultanate, laying the foundation for its dominance over northern India until the Mughal invasion. He introduced the silver tanka and the copper jital \u2013 the two basic coins of the Sultanate period, with a standard weight of 175 grains. He set up the Iqtadari system: division of empire into Iqtas, which were assigned to the nobles and officers in lieu of salary. He erected many buildings, including mosques, khanqahs (monasteries), dargahs (shrines or graves of influential people) and a reservoir (hawz) for pilgrims."

First, host code expressed in a Turing-complete language may diverge, resulting in unresponsive programs: i.e. reactive programs that are not actually reactive. Second, the bi-directional integration of reactive and non-reactive code results in a paradigmatic mismatch that, when unchecked, leads to faulty behaviour in programs. Approach: We propose a new reactive programming language, that has been meticulously designed to be reactive-only. We start with a simple (first-order) model for reactivity, based on reactors (i.e. uninstantiated descriptions of signals and their dependencies) and deployments (i.e. instances of reactors) that consist of signals. The language does not have the notion of functions, and thus unlike other RP languages there is no lifting either. We extend this simple model incrementally with additional features found in other programming languages, RP or otherwise. These features include stateful reactors (that allow for time-based accumulation), signals with dynamic dependencies by means of conditionals and polymorphic deployments, recursively-defined reactors, and (anonymous) reactors with lexical scope. Knowledge: In our description of these language features, we not only describe the syntax and semantics, but also how each features compares to the problems that exist in (EDSL) RP languages. I.e. by starting from a reactive-only model, we identify which reactive features (that, in other RP languages are typically expressed in non-reactive code) affect the reactive guarantees that can be enforced by the language. Grounding: We base our arguments by analysing the effect that each feature has on our language: e.g., by analysing how signals are updated, how they are created and how dependencies between signals can be affected. When applicable, we draw parallels with other languages: i.e. similarities shared with other RP languages will be highlighted and thoroughly analysed, and where relevant the same will also be done with non-reactive languages. Importance: Our language shows how a purely reactive programming is able to express the same kinds of programs as in other RP languages that require the use of (unchecked) functions. By considering reactive programs as a collection of pure (reactive-only) reactors, we aim to increase how reactive programming is comprehended by both language designers and its users."

        "text": " of the closed-loop nonlinear partial differential equation. 1. Introduction. In recent decades, a great effort has been made to take into account input saturations in control designs (see e.g [39], [15] or more recently [17]). In most applications, actuators are limited due to some physical constraints and the control input has to be bounded. Neglecting the amplitude actuator limitation can be source of undesirable and catastrophic behaviors for the closed-loop system. The standard method to analyze the stability with such nonlinear controls follows a two steps design. First the design is carried out without taking into account the saturation. In a second step, a nonlinear analysis of the closed-loop system is made when adding the saturation. In this way, we often get local stabilization results. Tackling this particular nonlinearity in the case of finite dimensional systems is already a difficult problem. However, nowadays, numerous techniques are available (see e.g. [39, 41, 37]) and such systems can be analyzed with an appropriate Lyapunov function and a sector condition of the saturation map, as introduced in [39]. In the literature, there are few papers studying this topic in the infinite dimensional case. Among them, we can cite [18], [29], where a wave equation equipped with a saturated distributed actuator is studied, and [12], where a coupled PDE/ODE system modeling a switched power converter with a transmission line is considered. Due to some restrictions on the system, a saturated feedback has to be designed in the latter paper. There exist also some papers using the nonlinear semigroup theory and focusing on abstract systems ([20],[34],[36]). Let us note that in [36], [34] and [20], the study of a priori bounded controller is tackled using abstract nonlinear theory. To be more specific, for bounded ([36],[34]) and unbounded ([34]) control operators, some conditions are derived to deduce, from the asymptotic stability of an infinite-dimensional linear system in abstract form, the asymptotic stability when closing the loop with saturating controller. These articles use the nonlinear semigroup theory (see e.g. [24] or [1]). The Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV for short)"

We present in this paper an evaluation of straightforward approaches aiming at reducing the dimensionality of the matrix M for each movement, leading to consider both the dimensionality reduction of the feature vector as well as its reduction along the time axis. The dimensionality reduction of the feature vector is achieved by selecting remarkable joints in the skeleton performing the movement, basically the extremities of the articulatory chains composing the skeleton. The temporal dimen-sionality reduction is achieved using either a regular or adaptive down-sampling that seeks to minimize the reconstruction error of the movements. Elastic and Euclidean kernels are then compared through support vector machine learning. Two data sets 1 that are widely referenced in the domain of human gesture recognition, and quite distinctive in terms of quality of motion capture, are used for the experimental assessment of the proposed approaches. On these data sets we experimentally show that it is feasible, and possibly desirable, to significantly reduce simultaneously the size of the feature vector and the number of skeleton frames to represent body movements while maintaining a very good recognition rate. The method proves to give satisfactory results at a level currently reached by state-of-the-art methods on these data sets. We experimentally show that the computational complexity reduction that is obtained makes this approach eligible for real-time applications."

We finally illustrate our hyperbolic viscoelastic flow models numerically using computer simulations in benchmark test cases. On extending to Maxwell fluids some free-shear flow testcases that are standard benchmarks for Newtonian fluids, we first show that our (numerical) models reproduce well the viscoelastic physics, phenomenologically at least, with zero retardation-time. Moreover, with a view to quantitative evaluations, numerical results in the lid-driven cavity testcase show that, in fact, our models can be compared with standard viscoelastic flow models in sheared-flow benchmarks on adequately choosing the physical parameters of our models.

Interobserver reproducibility was measured by evaluating the scores obtained with, and without assistance between two readers pathologists and was also measured between each reader pathologist and the expert ground truth to determine the accuracy of the established score. Results:Baseline linearly weighted Cohen's Kappa for interobserver agreement of MS between two readers pathologists was 0.482. Using the algorithm generated mitotic detection in WSI, the agreement score increased to 0.672.

What does it have to do with this $2 bill, which is a United States note and not a silver certificate?\n\nedit:\n\nTo make this clear, there were six different types of small-size American currency, differentiated by their seal color.\n\n1. Yellow: Gold certificates\n2. Blue: Silver certificates\n3. Green: Federal Reserve Notes\n4. Red: United States Notes\n5. Brown: National Bank Notes\n6. Brown: Federal Reserve Bank Notes\n\nAs someone else previously stated, the last $2 silver certificates were issued in 1899. They are much larger than today's money, and would be impossible to mix up with a red-seal $2.\nVQForeShadows: redeemable for their face value of silver dollar coins.... which lead upp until 1966...based on a standard, not just printed money. I believe you were thinking of the Large Sized Silver Certificates in your prior argument.\nVQForeShadows: I see what you are saying, that they are not labeled as \"Silver Certificates\", but the \"bearer on demand\" still represents a standard in which you could redeem the bills for silver.\n\nsilver dollar(s) payable to the bearer on demand\" or \"X dollars in silver coin payable to the bearer on demand\". This required that the Treasury maintain stocks of silver dollars to back and redeem the silver certificates in circulation\nAU_is_better: The silver redemption up until 1968 was for blue-seal silver certificates only. A red-seal 1966 $2 could not be exchanged for anything except a green-seal Federal Reserve Note.\nVQForeShadows: I think I got it now.\n"

Opinion in the U.S. was split on how to respond, and although majorities in both the House and Senate voted for war, they divided along strict party lines, with the Democratic-Republican Party in favour and the Federalist Party against. News of British concessions made in an attempt to avoid war did not reach the U.S. until late July, by which time the conflict was already underway.\nAt sea, the Royal Navy imposed an effective blockade on U.S. maritime trade, while between 1812 and 1814 British regulars and colonial militia defeated a series of American attacks on Upper Canada. The abdication of Napoleon in early 1814 allowed the British to send additional troops to North America and the Royal Navy to reinforce their blockade, crippling the American economy. In August 1814, negotiations began in Ghent, with both sides wanting peace; the British economy had been severely impacted by the trade embargo, while the Federalists convened the Hartford Convention in December to formalise their opposition to the war.\nIn August 1814, British troops captured Washington, before American victories at Baltimore and Plattsburgh in September ended fighting in the north. In the Southeastern United States, American forces and Indian allies defeated an anti-American faction of the Creek. In early 1815, American troops defeated a major British attack on New Orleans, even though the Treaty of Ghent had already been signed 15 days before, formally ending the war."

I simply cannot comprehend how people call this game a \u2018masterpiece\u2019, while I do respect that it is still a good game.\nBillionTonsHyperbole: I haven't played video games since the late '90s. Simply haven't had any interest. I've heard the name *Skyrim* but know nothing about it at all.\n\nIf I were to sit down and play this game, would it be \"overrated\" from my perspective? Would I consider it to be a \"masterpiece?\" My memory of video games doesn't include a lot of dialogue or villagers (*Final Fantasy VII* maybe?), but I'll bet *Skyrim* would be far superior by comparison.\nDeliciousMelons: That\u2019s fair, if you haven\u2019t played games like Skyrim before, you may think it\u2019s a master piece. But I have played similar games, fantasy open world RPGS, that made the world feel a lot more immersive. That\u2019s why I believe the game is overrated, compared to other games in the same genre.\nBillionTonsHyperbole: Does the subjectivity of one's experience change your view at all? \n\nAnother example: I might find a Rubik's Cube flat and boring, but there's no denying that it's a masterpiece of a puzzle toy. I can appreciate it for what it is, how it's engineered, and certainly for its important place in the popular zeitgeist of Top Toys even if I personally find it to be lacking when it's in my hands.\nDeliciousMelons: Very interesting! However I don\u2019t see how this has anything to do with Skyrim being overrated. I believe Skyrim is a good game, I\u2019m not disputing that. But when compared to other games of the same genre, it falls flat for me. I believe there\u2019s a bias behind a lot of people\u2019s view of the game simply because it\u2019s rated so highly in the first place.\nBillionTonsHyperbole: It has to do with your subjectivity of experience. The \"Wisdom of the Crowd\" has apparently deemed that both the Rubik's Cube and *Skyrim* are masterpieces, at least for the time being. If you don't go for that, then that's fine, but they have still earned their very high ratings.\n\nSimilarly, many people will tell you that *Citizen Kane* is the greatest movie ever made. Plenty of people find it boring, but sufficient numbers of aficionados, experts, reviewers, and everyday film buffs rate it so highly that it maintains its position. Opinions will differ, but the designation remains.\nDeliciousMelons: You\u2019re right, opinions will differ. Views are typically based off opinions. Mine still hasn\u2019t been changed.\n"

We also describe the theory {\\it dual} to the fundamental string for which the roles of elementary and soliton solutions are interchanged. In ten spacetime dimensions, this dual theory is a superfivebrane and this gives rise to a string/fivebrane duality conjecture according to which the fivebrane may be regarded as fundamental in its own right, with the strongly coupled string corresponding to the weakly coupled fivebrane and vice-versa. After compactification to four spacetime dimensions, the fivebrane appears as a magnetic monopole or a dual string according as it wraps around five or four of the compactified dimensions. This gives rise to a four-dimensional string/string duality conjecture which subsumes a Montonen-Olive type duality in that the magnetic monopoles of the fundamental string correspond to the electric winding states of the dual string. This leads to a {\\it duality of dualities} whereby under string/string duality the the strong/weak coupling $S$-duality trades places with the minimum/maximum length $T$-duality. Since these magnetic monopoles are extreme black holes, a prediction of $S$-duality is that the corresponding electric massive states of the fundamental string are also extreme black holes."

Developers who create their applications using high-level programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, etc.) are required to familiarize with a hardware description language (e.g., VHDL, Verilog) or recently heterogeneous programming models (e.g., OpenCL, HLS) in order to exploit the co-processors? capacity and tune the performance of their applications. Currently, the above-mentioned heterogeneous programming models support exclusively the compilation from compiled languages, such as C and C++. Thus, the transparent integration of heterogeneous co-processors to the software ecosystem of managed programming languages (e.g. Java, Python) is not seamless. In this paper we rethink the engineering trade-offs that we encountered, in terms of transparency and compilation overheads, while integrating FPGAs into high-level managed programming languages. We present a novel approach that enables runtime code specialization techniques for seamless and high-performance execution of Java programs on FPGAs. The proposed solution is prototyped in the context of the Java programming language and TornadoVM; an open-source programming framework for Java execution on heterogeneous hardware. Finally, we evaluate the proposed solution for FPGA execution against both sequential and multi-threaded Java implementations showcasing up to 224x and 19.8x performance speedups, respectively, and up to 13.82x compared to TornadoVM running on an Intel integrated GPU.

We choose two case studies from a measurement campaign (August 2018) with different synoptic wind directions (South-West and North-West). Model evaluation with an array of eddy-covariance stations on the glacier tongue and surroundings reveals that WRF is able to simulate the general glacier boundary-layer structure. Under southwesterly airflow, the down-glacier wind is supported by the South-Western synoptic wind direction, a stable boundary layer is present over the ice surface, and local processes govern the turbulence kinetic energy production. Under northwesterly airflow, a cross-glacier valley flow and a breaking gravity wave lead strong turbulent mixing and to the subsequent erosion of the glacier boundary layer. Stationarity analyses of the sensible heat flux suggest non-stationary behaviour for both case study days, while non-stationarity is highest on the NW day during the gravity-wave event. These results suggest that the synoptic wind direction has, in addition to upstream topography and the atmospheric stability, a strong impact on whether a local glacier boundary layer can form or not, influencing whether a glacier is able to maintain its own microclimate."

Along those lines, the second half where he really digs in to Rousseau is I suppose more the \"exercise in\" portion, where Derrida is taking the quasi-axiomatic he has set out to pick apart the blind spots in Rousseau.  As addressing the blind spots, the neglected theoretical gaps in the text, is the central work of deconstruction, you have to apply the same ethic that Derrida applies to Rousseau to your own reading of Derrida, and in doing so you should (Derrida might hope) be able to discern the method that's at work.\n\nBasically, the work is in a lot of ways an exposition of Derrida's method, so what you should be reading for is not a concrete set of points in which he agrees or disagrees with Rousseau, but a set of tools that he uses and which you might be able to use in your own readings.  So look in the blind spots, look at what Derrida is doing, more than the results that may or may not be coherently spit out at the end.\n\nOne last semi-tip: Paul de Man's essay in \"Blindness and Insight\" on Derrida's reading of Rousseau is an illuminating work of deconstruction in its own right, and for me it made the process of reading Derrida make a lot more sense (i.e. I knew what the hell I was doing when I was reading Derrida, which as I've implied here is more important than knowing what he is \"actually saying\")\n\nAlso, understanding Derrida to some degree is absolutely essential to grappling with most things that could rightly be called post-[put anything here].  That, and it's one of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding things I've ever read.  It made me feel like I needed to go back and re-read everything I've ever read with a new critical energy.  Some call it wordy and dry, but for me it was a lot of fun!  I realize I didn't actually explain any of his points here at all, except that deconstruction is a METHOD...so if you wanna chat more directly about da facts, we can do that!\nravia: Method or strategy?\n[deleted]: good point, I kinda like using \"strategy\" here...gives it the 'political' edge that Derrida's later writings insisted were there all along.\nravia: Perhaps that says something about his, erm, difficulties with Gadamer, who wrote *Truth and Method*.\n"

You're better off laminating another 2x10 to the original ones, or putting in a beam down the middle like you suggested to break the span. \n\nIn theory I suppose you could add a 2x6 \"shoe piece\" to the joists to make them like an upside down \"T\" beam, but probably more hassle than it's worth, when you can just add a beam down the middle and break the span. \nPaxonator: Well many say plywood is just as strong, and easier to install. Also it doesn't fluctuate in size as much as regular lumber. I cannot get 14ft 2x10's beside the originals. Longest on many might be 10ft due to all the lines under the crawl space being in the way.\n\nI've read about doing the 2x6 along the bottom of each joist.

With blocking it should do a fair amount to help the bounce. If you're in a position to be able to add a center support or use 2x10s, however, I would go with that.\ndbhyslop: I sistered the joists under my kitchen and it made a tremendous improvement in the stiffness of the floor.  Since they don't need to go all the way onto the sill plates they're easy to install.  I used construction adhesive and lots of screws, maybe three every foot or so.\nPaxonator: Did you use regular dimensional lumber or plywood?\ndbhyslop: Regular lumber.

Finally, braille labels are used for textual descriptions but only a small percentage of the visually impaired population reads braille. In France 15% of blind people are braille readers and only 10% can read and write. In the United States, fewer than 10% of the legally blind people are braille readers and only 10% of blind children actually learn braille. Recent technological advances have enabled the design of interactive maps with the aim to overcome these limitations. Indeed, interactive maps have the potential to provide a broad spectrum of the population with spatial knowledge, irrespective of age, impairment, skill level, or other factors. To this regard, they might be an efficient means for providing visually impaired people with access to geospatial information.

To address these issues, the present contribution elaborates on the analysis of the scaling properties of fMRI temporal dynamics by proposing two significant variations. First, scaling properties are technically investigated using the recently introduced Wavelet Leader-based Multifractal formalism (WLMF; Wendt et al., 2007). This measures a collection of scaling exponents, thus enables a richer and more versatile description of scale invariance (beyond correlation and Gaussianity), referred to as multifractality. Also, it benefits from improved estimation performance compared to tools previously used in the literature. Second, scaling properties are investigated in both RSN and non-RSN structures (e.g., artifacts), at a broader spatial scale than the voxel one, using a multivariate approach, namely the Multi-Subject Dictionary Learning (MSDL) algorithm (Varoquaux et al., 2011) that produces a set of spatial components that appear more sparse than their Independent Component Analysis (ICA) counterpart. These tools are combined and applied to a fMRI dataset comprising 12 subjects with resting-state and activation runs (Sadaghiani et al., 2009). Results stemming from those analysis confirm the already reported task-related decrease of long memory in functional networks, but also show that it occurs in artifacts, thus making this feature not specific to functional networks. Further, results indicate that most fMRI signals appear multifractal at rest except in non-cortical regions. Task-related modulation of multifractality appears only significant in functional networks and thus can be considered as the key property disentangling functional networks from artifacts. These finding are discussed in the light of the recent literature reporting scaling dynamics of EEG microstate sequences at rest and addressing non-stationarity issues in temporally independent fMRI modes."

The knowledge about this relationship enables us to improve on implementation techniques for EDSLs. Knowledge: This paper argues that common OOP mechanisms (including inheritance, subtyping, and type-refinement) increase the modularity and reuse of shallow EDSLs when compared to classical procedural abstraction by enabling a simple way to express multiple, possibly dependent, interpretations. Grounding: We make our arguments by using Gibbons and Wu's examples, where procedural abstraction is used in Haskell to model a simple shallow EDSL. We recode that EDSL in Scala and with an improved OO-inspired Haskell encoding. We further illustrate our approach with a case study on refactoring a deep external SQL query processor to make it more modular, shallow, and embedded. Importance: This work is important for two reasons. Firstly, from an intellectual point of view, this work establishes the connection between shallow embeddings and OOP, which enables a better understanding of both concepts. Secondly, this work illustrates programming techniques that can be used to improve the modularity and reuse of shallow EDSLs."

For a given material symmetry class, this allows to express more easily the free energy density at any bi-degree in $\\sigma$ and m (i.e. at any constitutive tensors order for the so-called tensorial formulation). A rigorous and systematic method is essential to obtain the high-degree magneto-mechanical coupling terms and to build a free energy density function at any order which is invariant by the action of the cubic (octahedral) group. For that aim, theoretical and computer tools in Invariant Theory, that allow for the mathematical description of cubic nonlinear magneto-elasticity, are introduced. Minimal integrity bases of the invariant algebra for the pair (m, $\\sigma$), under the proper (orientation-preserving) and the full cubic groups, are then proposed. The minimal integrity basis for the proper cubic group is constituted of 60 invariants, while the minimal integrity basis for the full cubic group (the one of interest for magneto-elasticity) is made up of 30 invariants. These invariants are formulated in a (coordinate free) intrinsic manner, using a generalized cross product to write some of them. The counting of independent invariants of a given multi-degree in (m, $\\sigma$) is performed. It is shown accordingly that it is possible to list without error all the material parameters useful for the description of the coupled magnetoelastic behavior from the integrity basis. The technique is applied to derive general expressions $\\Psi$ $\\star$ ($\\sigma$, m) of the free energy density at the magnetic domains scale exhibiting cubic symmetry.

If you went to a local tourist spot in downtown Dehli, you might think it's authentic, but it's geared to tourists who come to India to see \"authentic \" Indian culture and eat authentic Indian food while ignoring that they are doing so in a place that makes millions of dollars in the tourism business and know how to cater to American adventure seekers.  Tourism is a major industry.  \n\nAnd as I said, most of the tourists I know who visit other countries are doing exactly that.  They go to Cancun or Puerta Vallarta, San Juan, or Tokyo or Seoul.  Places that every American visiting those countries goes to.  Many of them never leave the downtown area for more than a day.  So you essentially see the Disney version of those cultures where it's all made to look unique while being completely chewed on to not offend American sensibility or tastebuds.  If you want authentic, go to Rural Mexico where you'll be one of the only Americans there.  Go to rural Japan or Korea for that matter.  \n"

Run a russian roulette game and you will be in trouble.  \nflamingfireworks: yes, that is literally what i just said. Waivers mean jack shit in court if you dont have the best lawyer there is, and at best the waiver is just evidence that you both knew there's an inherent risk to the action, which can work against the person being sued.\nnicklesismoneyto: But isn't signing the waiver that person completely accepting that risk as their responsibility? I'm asking sincerely because I didn't know waivers could be tossed so easily. I'm having trouble understanding how someone accepting a risk can come back on someone else.\nflamingfireworks: eh, not really.\n\nFor one, (depending on the lawyer, county, etc) it can be argued the waiver is signed under duress or unfair circumstances. In this case, it wouldnt be too hard to say \"the guy was given a choice to sign his name on a piece of paper or starve that day\" to get the judge to agree that the waiver aint shit.\n\nFor two, to prevent people from just throwing around \"if you enter my property and sign this waiver, you cant sue me for anything\" contracts and then not doing anything to ensure safety in the property or just straightup forcing people to do unsafe shit, part of what a judge and jury is responsible for is to look at the waiver and the circumstances and conditions of the incident and decide if the waiver is something written in bad faith, pretty much, or if its still *clearly* not the injured person's fault. So like, if im running a business, and i hire you, make you sign the waiver, and then i say \"go over there, take the fries out of the fryer\", but i had neglected to maintain it properly, and as you get there, the oil sprays out and melts your face or some shit, and you sued me, the judge would take one look at it and decide \"yeah, this is most definitely not the injured person's fault\" and throw the waiver out\n\n3.

I don\u2019t believe there is a business impact to this, but it just makes you look dumb. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**Why YSK:** Yelp reviews have a really big impact on a business. Star ratings really matter, especially when people are spending seconds scanning their phone to see what's rated as good and what's not. Please be thoughtful of businesses.\nsliight: Even better, tell everyone you know not to not use Yelp.\n\nIt's bad enough that they essentially extort money from businesses, but from a user standpoint they don't list every business. I'm fine if the non paying businesses are last, but the app is fairly useless when it leaves out what you're looking for.\n\nIf I look for restaurants, I want to see them all within specified distance. There's plenty of great places that don't waste the money on yelp as they don't need to, so the user misses out on them if they don't use better search options.\nboafriend: I hear you. I\u2019ve heard shady things about some listing manipulation despite Yelp claiming they don\u2019t engage in such practices. But at the end of the day, it is still a huge platform a lot of consumers turn to for trust and info, so I still think it\u2019s important to maintain accuracy of reviews.\nsliight: Definitely agree there. I know business owners that check every review. It's frustrating when I see people leave negative reviews for dumb reasons as it can really hurt business, especially if new.\n\nJust wish they'd list everyone so there would be more value for the actually consumer they target.\nboafriend: At the end of the day, they are a business, and like many social platforms, you have to pay for greater exposure. I know paid listings show up at the top (like Google Ads), but IDK how the rest of their algorithm works for listings. You can always use the filters to narrow your search by star-rating or popularity and such tho, which is helpful. I do think they need something in place to field these stupid reviews that I speak of in my original post though. I know Yelp already has an algorithm that hides reviews it deems as unreliable (the \u201chidden\u201d reviews) but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. People will write non-related reviews a lot out of sheer laziness though.\nsliight: I agree that they're for profit, I don't use as they literally exclude businesses. I know I'll end up searching elsewhere to get all the restaurants in the area so I just uninstalled their app and never think to use them anymore. Too often on vacation they exclude top places to eat when those places don't pay as they are busy enough... I'd love to use them if they'd just put everyone on.\n"

We conclude that for all galaxies in our sample the stellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio is always lower than the universal baryonic mass fraction. Using our results, and a compilation from the literature, we furthermore show that there is a strong correlation between stellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio and derived halo masses for central galaxies, such that more massive haloes contain a lower fraction of their mass in the form of stars over our entire redshift range. For central galaxies in haloes with masses M(halo)>10^13M(sun) we find that this ratio is <0.02, much lower than the universal baryonic mass fraction. We show that the remaining baryonic mass is included partially in stars within satellite galaxies in these haloes, and as diffuse hot and warm gas. We also find that, at a fixed stellar mass, the stellar-to-total-mass ratio increases at lower redshifts. This suggests that galaxies at a fixed stellar mass form later in lower mass dark matter haloes, and earlier in massive haloes. We interpret this as a \"halo downsizing\" effect, however some of this evolution could be attributed to halo assembly bias."

According to her, she never really knows what to say to him sometimes and from my perspective it seems as if I have a much better shot with her than he does.\u00a0\n\n\nSo I said I'd do my best to get out that night and I did. I was full throttle heading over reading to just kiss her and let her know everything, and I've never been that confident with a girl in my life. I approached the line to get in - but as I did, there she was standing there with that other guy I'm pretty sure both of us spotted each other instantly but didn't acknowledge as it just seems much too awkward of a time. She left, and all I got was a wave and a week prior of basically wanting me, not many girls are THAT into me, so I really like her and I feel nearly broken.\n\n\nI'm still getting to see her on Monday cus college and I have a feeling that she'll just act as if nothing has happened. A) Because I'm not sure if she knows that I like her that much and B) Because she probably didn't take it that seriously from her viewpoint to be fair it probably doesn't seem like much happened.\n\n\nI still like her, and although I feel kind of hurt. I don't want to stop speaking to her because nothing inherently bad happened. I just like her a lot and want things to work, I'm going to be as honest as I can with her and let her know that I was just going to see her, I'm fairly sure she thinks I like her and that's okay but I'll also let her know that that situation made me uncomfortable, I basically get emotionally attached way too quickly but the week we had was filled with flirting and she seems more interested in me from my perspective than him.\nKaleopolitus: So, yeah, sounds like you've got your plan sorted out.\n\nTelling the girl you like her? Check.\n\nInforming her that what she did hurt you? Check.\n\nThe only advice I can give you here is to get a better grip on your emotions. What you tell yourself can become your reality, given enough willpower behind it. Even if you get emotionally attached fast, you can still slow it down by repeatedly reminding yourself of what has happened and how much it implies and means so far.\n\nAlso, please... PLEASE prepare yourself for potential disappointment. It sounds to me like she's double dipping. While she may be faithful in a relationship, the fact that she's seeing two guys at once in an interested fashion... this could go wrong fast.\nThrow_away-101: That's also what I'm weary of.

For geostationary spacecraft, the inclination change caused by the gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon must be counteracted by a rather large expense of fuel, as the inclination should be kept sufficiently small for the spacecraft to be tracked by non-steerable antennae.\nFor spacecraft in a low orbit, the effects of atmospheric drag must often be compensated for, often to avoid re-entry; for missions requiring the orbit to be accurately synchronized with the Earth\u2019s rotation, this is necessary to prevent a shortening of the orbital period.\nSolar radiation pressure will in general perturb the eccentricity (i.e. the eccentricity vector); see Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft). For some missions, this must be actively counter-acted with maneuvers. For geostationary spacecraft, the eccentricity must be kept sufficiently small for a spacecraft to be tracked with a non-steerable antenna. Also for Earth observation spacecraft for which a very repetitive orbit with a fixed ground track is desirable, the eccentricity vector should be kept as fixed as possible. A large part of this compensation can be done by using a frozen orbit design, but often thrusters are needed for fine control maneuvers.\nFor spacecraft in a halo orbit around a Lagrange point, station-keeping is even more fundamental, as such an orbit is unstable; without an active control with thruster burns, the smallest deviation in position or velocity would result in the spacecraft leaving orbit completely.\n\n"

The local shear transient response of the suspensions when the shear flow is reversed is measured at this point where the particle volume fraction is well defined. The local rheological measurements presented here confirm the macroscopic measurements of Gadala-Maria and Acrivos (1980). After shear reversal, the viscosity undergoes a step-like reduction, decreases slower and passes through a minimum before increasing again to reach a plateau. Upon varying the particle concentration, we have been able to show that the minimum and the plateau viscosities do not obey the same scaling law with respect to the particle volume fraction. These experimental results are consistent with the scaling predicted by Mills and Snabre (2009) and with the results of numerical simulation performed on random suspensions [Sierou and Brady (2001)]. The minimum seems to be associated with the viscosity of an isotropic suspension, or at least of a suspension whose particles do not interact through non-hydrodynamic forces, while the plateau value would correspond to the viscosity of a suspension structured by the shear where the non-hydrodynamic forces play a crucial role."

Do I use a water-based stain or a wax stain? Is there a pro and con for that?\n2) I'm having a hard time sanding the details. I used a random orbital to lightly scuff off the paint so far. I know some people are bristling at that, but whatever. What's done is done and I'm happy with it so far. But how do I get inside those crevaces? I tried just sandpaper, but it's a bitch and a half and seems to do nothing.\n3) What the hell is the hard top of this furniture made of. If I paint it, am I going to have a problem later on?\n4) Should I even bother staining? Any personal opinions on it?\ncaddis789: It looks like the top of it is laminate (like what is often used in kitchen cabinets). You rarely get good results painting it. The paint won't adhere well. Maybe if you sanded it lightly, you could get an oil based paint to stick to it. Stain won't do anything to it. It might be worth trying, since you wanted to paint the top anyway. If you look up at the top from inside the cabinet, you should be able to see whether it is a solid wood top or particle board. If it's wood, you might think about removing the laminate and sanding it. The laminate will come off with a heat gun (you can rent one) of even a dry hot iron.\n\nAs for the body, there are some chemical strippers that would make the crevices easier, but they're still a pain in the ass. You would then hand sand after the stripper to get the last remnants off. The wood looks like birch or beech, if you like the look of the stain, go for it.\n\nedit: I've never used a water based stain, only oil stains. They're pretty easy to use. After sanding, brush and wipe off all dust, wipe on the stain with a rag (wear gloves), wait a few minutes and then wipe off the excess. When you're wiping off the stain you can rub it in to blend any uneven spots. You shouldn't need a conditioner or pre-treatment for hardwood. For finish, I prefer oil based polyurethane over water based (just my preference) and choose between satin or gloss.\nSenorWeird: I wasn't planning on staining the top, just paint. If I sand it, then use an oil-based bonding primer before painting and then coating it with polycrylic, shouldn't that prevent it from any peeling or not adhering? If you look at the last picture, I'm pretty sure that is solid wood underneath. Guess I'll have to rent a heat gun and give it a try.\n\nI never thought of trying a stripper on the crevices. I might just give that a go. Thanks!\nHollaberra: You can use a dremmel tool with the conical bit for detail work. You can also paint laminate. Pinterest is full of bloggers who have used a paint+primer to paint laminate furniture with great success.\n\nEdited to add: you can always stain the base and then get a small artist paint brush and use the same white as the top to paint out the details that are still yellow. Just an alternative.\n"

It goes against my instincts as a planner, but I've always followed it.\nchubaccatron: That's advice from someone who does not know how to properly road trip. Unless you're driving with someone else, know your limits. Only drive 8-10 hours per day max and book hotels in advance that will put you around that distance away from where you woke up. The bonus is that you don't feel the need to overly push it, you save money from booking in advance, you don't run the risk of sleeping in your car if you get tired and can't find a vacancy, you may find yourself with some extra time to explore the area you're staying in and you'll know about the place you're staying, so you can take proper precautions to keep your stuff safe. In a pinch, just book the hotel that morning before you leave or when you stop for lunch. But I highly advise booking at least a day or two in advance.   \nI've done this more than I care to admit.\ngriz50cal: I disagree with this, booking a place to stay in advance will limit you. You should drive until you feel tired and then find a place to stop... I have shaved an entire day off of my trip this way (I can drive 16 hours straight some days) On days like this I saved the extra time and money that would have been spent staying in a place just because it was booked in advance. \nI also didn't care when I had to give up early and stop at the nearest motel to avoid sitting in hours of traffic... \n"

The only reason I didn't call someone is that for some reason it is impossible to find people that still work on steam boilers anymore.\nfumoking: I have walked countless homeowners through diagnosing over the phone only from describing furnace sequence of operations. There's a lot of things I won't tell a homeowner to do without experience but diagnostics are stupid easy on a gas furnace like 90% of the time. Steam boilers, oil furnaces, AC/HP, mini splits thigh are a different story altogether. Almost no seasoned technician I know can competently diagnose and service all these types of units without having our hands held by tech support, but the gas furnace is something we know inside and out after a couple of harsh Winters\nDr_Wh00ves: Yeah, experience is key for stuff like this. Unfortunately, the company that manufactured our boiler went out of business before I installed it due to it being new-old stock. That coupled with almost no information online for the model meant I was pretty much forced to go in blind on the whole thing. After tracing the entire board with a multimeter I finally found out that the issue was caused by a broken trace. Ended up soldering in a bypass and it has held for years now so I must have done something right haha.\nfumoking: Sometimes that's what it takes. Especially when I was new and didn't know how to read wiring diagrams it was a lot of jumping around and isolating to narrow down. Good shit\n"

By contrast, previous algorithms required that the prioritization partial order be layered, i.e., structured similar to the system of rank in the military. Our algorithm enables, for the first time, the implementation of the most useful class of prioritization: non-layered prioritization partial orders. Default inheritance, for example, typically requires non-layered prioritization to represent specificity adequately. Our algorithm enables not only the implementation of default inheritance (and specificity) within prioritized circumscription, but also the extension and combination of default inheritance with other kinds of prioritized default reasoning, e.g.: with stratified logic programs with negation-as-failure. Such logic programs are previously known to be representable equivalently as layered-priority predicate circumscriptions. Worst-case, the transform increases the number of defaults exponentially. We discuss how inferencing is practically implementable nevertheless in two kinds of situations: general expressiveness but small numbers of defaults, or expressive special cases with larger numbers of defaults. One such expressive special case is non-?top-heaviness? of the prioritization partial order. In addition to its direct implementation, the transform can also be exploited analytically to generate special case algorithms, e.g., a tractable transform for a class within default inheritance (detailed in another, forthcoming paper). We discuss other aspects of the significance of the fundamental result. One can view the transform as reducing n degrees of partially ordered belief confidence to just 2 degrees of confidence: for-sure and (unprioritized) default. Ordinary, parallel default reasoning, e.g., in parallel circumscription or Poole's Theorist, can be viewed in these terms as reducing 2 degrees of confidence to just 1 degree of confidence: that of the non-monotonic theory's conclusions. The expressive reduction's computational complexity suggests that prioritization is valuable for its expressive conciseness, just as defaults are for theirs. For Reiter's Default Logic and Poole's Theorist, the transform implies how to extend those formalisms so as to equip them with a concept of prioritization that is exactly equivalent to that in circumscription. This provides an interesting alternative to Brewka's approach to equipping them with prioritization-type precedence."

Other individual mountains in the cirque include Shark's Nose, Warbonnet, Warrior Peak, Wolfs Head and Pingora Peak. There are hundreds of routes to choose from in difficulties ranging from 5.1 to 5.11a and since the mountains are composed primarily of granite rock, there is good anchoring. These climbs include two featured in Steck and Roper's Fifty Classic Climbs of North America the Northeast Face of Pingora (IV, 5.9) and the East Ridge of the Wolf's Head (III, 5.6).\nFor both the climber and backpacker, access to the cirque from the west from Pinedale, Wyoming requires a 55 mi (89 km) drive, partly paved and partly gravel, to the Big Sandy trailhead. There is a small National Forest campground at the trailhead. An 8.7 mi (14.0 km) hike beginning at 9,000 ft (2,700 m) above sea level is relatively level the first 7 mi (11 km) and becomes very steep the last mile (1.6 km) and ascends to Jackass Pass at 10,800 ft (3,300 m), crossing the continental divide. From there one must descend a steep half mile (800 m) to Lonesome Lake, which is one of four lakes in the cirque. Expect the trail to be busy in July and August as the cirque is the most popular hiking and climbing destination in the Wind River Range. Lonesome Lake was the first lake in the Wind River Range whose water was deemed unfit for consumption due to human waste and consequently, no camping is permitted within a quarter mile (400 m) of the lake. The granitic rocks allow poor filtration of ground water and the ability of many alpine lakes to cleanse themselves is often poorer than one might find at lower altitudes."

They have been used in very different domains such as computer science, biology, sociology, management, etc. Authors have been trying to characterize them using various measures such as degree distribution, transitivity or average distance. Their goal is to detect certain properties such as the small-world or scale-free properties. Previous works have shown some of these properties are present in many different systems, while others are characteristic of certain types of systems only. However, each one of these studies generally focuses on a very small number of topological measures and networks. In this work, we aim at using a more systematic approach. We first constitute a dataset of 152 publicly available networks, spanning over 7 different domains. We then process 14 different topological measures to characterize them in the most possible complete way. Finally, we apply standard data mining tools to analyze these data.

Ta Vas a Acordar (1993), was certified gold for reaching sales of 50,000 units, and its titular track peaked at number one on Radio y Musica's Tejano Singles chart for nine weeks, the second-most weeks a song spent atop the chart in 1995. In a strategic endeavor to promote Hobbs in Mexico, EMI Latin rebranded his band from Hot Sauce to Grupo Mezquite in August 1994. Te Vas a Acordar ended 1994 as the 13th best-selling Regional Mexican Album in the United States.\nHobbs released Soy el Mismo in 1995, while it received a mixed response from music critics, it peaked at number seven on the US Billboard Top Latin Albums chart and number three on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart. \"Por Favor Corazon\" peaked at number 18 on the Hot Latin Songs chart and number 15 on the Regional Mexican Songs chart, and ended 1995 as the second-best Tejano single on Radio y Musica, while \"Tu Me Haces Sentir\" ended the year as the 13th-best Tejano single of 1995. Following the release of Corazon Ardiente (1996), Hobbs became a spokesperson for Coca-Cola. During a period of decline in the popularity of Tejano music and decreasing sales within the genre, Hobbs created his own record label and studio, Faith Digital Recording Studio and AMMX. After his contract expired with EMI Latin in 1998, Hobbs signed with Sony Discos. The singer received the BMI Songwriters Award in 1998 for \"Buscando Un Amor\" and \"Corazon Ardiente\" and in 1999 for \"Comprendeme\".\nBy 2001, Hobbs became independent and released subsequent albums through his AMMX label. At the 2020 Tejano Music Awards, Hobbs won Male Entertainer of the Year, after years of being nominated. On August 31, 2021, Hobbs launched his podcast Hanging With Gary, with co-host Johnny Davila. On April 20, 2022, Hobbs signed with Freddie Records, citing the label's ability to secure radio airplay for their artists as his reason, and released Sin Fin that December. In 2019, Hobbs received recognition from the Texas State Legislature, represented by Poncho Nevarez, for his contributions to Tejano music. In recognition of his humanitarian contributions, Hobbs was awarded the Humanitarian Award by the Tejano Entertainers and Musicians Association Awards (TEMA) in 1999."

In addition, very high resolution images (SPOT6) provided access to the fine structure of natural habitats, i.e. the vertical and horizontal organisation by states identified as elementary (mineral, herbaceous, low and high woody). Indeed, one of the essential limiting factors for brood rearing is the presence of a well-developed herbaceous or ericaceous stratum in the northern Alps and larch forests in the southern region. A deep learning model was used to classify elementary strata. Finally, Biomod2 R platform, using an ensemble approach, was applied to model, the favourable habitat of Black Grouse reproduction. Of all the models, Random Forest and Extreme Boosted Gradient are the best performing, with TSS and ROC scores close to 1. For the SDM, we selected only Random Forest models (ensemble modelling) because of their low susceptibility to overfitting and coherent predictions (after comparing model predictions).In this ensemble model, the most important explanatory variables are altitude, the proportion of heathland, and the DHI (NDVI Max and NDWI Max). Results from the habitat model can be used as an operational tool for monitoring forest landscape shifts and changes.

I mean, I could easily complete week 3 (in my last pullup workout I did 9-9-8-8-7-5), but to complete week 4, I would have to stop by 8th-9th rep, rest 20-30 seconds and force those 2-4 reps more, and as far as I understand, the goal is to do all sets without letting the bar go.\n\nSo maybe it's a trust issue, of it's really worth it. I mean, I don't want to waste my time. From the other hand, doing what I thought was right, wasn't really the best option either. \n\nWhat do you think, is this doable, reasonable program that have a chance to work and really progress me somewhat closer to 20 clean reps in a row, although it starts so easy? And the question from the beginning: do I just repeat a workout untill I complete given numbers, if I fail to do it on a first attempt?\n\nAnd maybe it makes sense to modify it; start from week 3, repeat it twice and then try to go further?\n\nAnd another very important question: will it be a good idea to do 2 or 3 sets of inverted rows after pullups, just to get more volume, or should I focus on those pullups exclusively? But it seems so little, for last months I've been doing 3 sets of weighted chins, followed by 3 sets of myo reps inverted rows, every two or three days... But than again, it didn't work that great.\n\nSorry, I'm just confused, trying to work my way out of beginner stage. Any advice will be appreciated.\n\nAlso: do you think does it makes sense to apply this program to weighted dips, heavy enough to fail before 10 reps?\ncmxguru: Have you considered using a pull-up assist band to get you through those extended reps?  A light band might allow you to get in 1-3 more reps after you fail.\nmt5z: Do you mean that if I fail to do 12 reps in week 4, I should hop on band to do the number? Well, what's the point, I'm supposed to get stronger at BW pullups here. After 20 seconds I'm ready to complete the set anyway.\ncmxguru: Then wait/rest. But pullups are the sorta exercise you can completely gas out on and find sets 2 and 3 of 12 reps very hard to complete even with a rest. Throw say a 20lb assist band on there after failure and it will still be incredibly hard but it could make set 3 completable.\n"

However, acute neuroprotection and conditioning strategies face a common translational issue: a myriad of possibilities exist, but with no strategy to select optimal candidates. In this review, we argue that what is required is a neuroprotective framework to identify the \"best\" agent(s), at the earliest investigational stage possible. This may require switching mindsets from identifying how neuroprotection can be achieved to determining how neuroprotection can fail, for the vast majority of candidates. Understanding the basis for failure can in turn guide supplementary treatment, thereby forming an evidence-based rationale for selecting combinations of therapies. An appropriately designed in vitro (neuron culture, brain slices) approach, based on increasing the harshness of the ischemic-like insult, can be useful in identifying the \"best\" conditioner or acute neuroprotective therapy, as well as how the two modalities can be combined to overcome individual limitations. This would serve as a base from which to launch further investigation into therapies required to protect the neurovascular unit in in vivo animal models of cerebral ischemia. Based on these respective approaches, our laboratories suggest that there is merit in examining synaptic activity-and nutraceutical-based preconditioning / acute neuroprotection."

The major findings of this study are: (i) We successfully coupled two heterogeneous flare prediction models trained with different datasets and model architecture to predict a full-disk flare probability for next 24 hours, (ii) Our proposed ensembling model, i.e., logistic regression, improves on the predictive performance of two base learners and the baseline meta learner measured in terms of two widely used metrics True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Heidke Skill core (HSS), and (iii) Our result analysis suggests that the logistic regression-based ensemble (Meta-FP) improves on the full-disk model (base learner) by $\\sim9\\%$ in terms TSS and $\\sim10\\%$ in terms of HSS. Similarly, it improves on the AR-based model (base learner) by $\\sim17\\%$ and $\\sim20\\%$ in terms of TSS and HSS respectively.

Despite the changeover, many words and expressions survived in Trinidad Creole and as a result also survived in its calypsos, including terms such as \"santimanitay\" from the original sans humanit\u00e9, among others.\nTrinidad became the mecca of calypso in part because it was the most prosperous territory in the region and consequently many migrants headed to the island during the 20th century, including performers. As a direct result, Trinidad became known as the land of calypso. \nMany early kaiso/calypsos were sung in French Creole, as Trinidad gained a significant number of free and enslaved blacks from the French Antilles of Martinique, Guadeloupe, French-dominated Grenada and Dominica following the Cedula of population of 1783. The patois or French creole was the original language of the calypsonian and calypso music."

They were all at slightly different elevations and all slightly off level, but I put a post into them and built my deck off the posts, because after I had them all up I could go around and cut them all off at the same level. Using a post system was more forgiving than the joists because I could wiggle a post back and forth a bit within the block to get it in the right spot whereas the joists I could not, they would move the whole block.  \n\nThe deck block doesn't have to sit perfectly level if you are using posts. Pound it into place and then put the post in, and the post should have just enough wiggle room that you can level it separately. \nsoul_system: I was researching these 4x4 posts + blocks now. Do the posts just sit down into the blocks without any additional fasteners? Is that not insecure?\nSophieFrise: Yes, the 4x4 sit in the middle area and then you can bolt the frame to the post. Some use deck screws, but we will probably use lag screws to really secure it.  The deck with all the frame and the ribs and the deck boards should make it extremely heavy to where it isn't \"suppose\" to really move and it isn't like all the weight is in one area, but I guess there is always that chance depending on weather and soil etc.  In some cases, you don't have a choice, especially if your yard slopes like ours do.  So we will probably put a couple of them at that end where needed.  My choice for the part that can sit ground level is to have the frame on the actually cement deck blocks.  That is our preference, but for the life of us, we just can't get the deck blocks to level on the ground. That's why I was reaching out to see if anyone can do it better than we can.\n\n It seems almost impossible to level it.  So now, we are either going to dig a little lower, use flat pavers on top of our gravel/sand and level the pavers \\(which should be easier than the heavy 50lb blocks\\) and once that is level and seated to the ground, we will put our blocks on top of that and it should sit level.  Another option, again, dig a little lower and then we can use the 4x4 and have that come out of the ground and get as close to ground level as we can, but... honestly, having my entire frame on post that aren't cemented into the ground is not my first option.  I know folks that have their deck on post, but for the most part, the posts are cemented into the ground.  \n"

For this latter stage of the algorithm, we use a pressure correction technique, and solve a balance equation for the so-called sensible enthalpy instead of the total energy balance, with corrective terms for consistency. The scheme is shown to satisfy the same stability properties as the continuous problem: the chemical species mass fractions are kept in the [0, 1] interval, the density and the sensible internal energy stay positive and the integral over the computational domain of a discrete total energy is conserved. In addition, we show that the scheme is in fact conservative, i.e. that its solution satisfy a conservative discrete total energy balance equation, with space and time discretizations which are unusual but consistent in the Lax-Wendroff sense. Finally, we observe numerically that the penalization procedure converges, i.e. that making the chemical time scale tend to zero allows to converge to the solution of the target (infinitely fast chemistry) continuous problem. Tests also evidence that the scheme accuracy dramatically depends on the discretization of the convection operator in the chemical species mass balances. October 14, 2020."

The development of these components have been started since 10 years at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille (LAM) and was linked to the project phases: prototypes have been developed to demonstrate the feasibility, then engineering and qualification models to validate the optical and mechanical performance of the component, finally the flight models have been manufactured and tested and will be installed on NISP instrument. In this paper, we present the optical performance of the four EUCLID NISP grisms flight models characterized at LAM: wavefront error, spectral transmission and grating groove profiles. The test devices and the methods developed for the characterization of these specific optical components are described. The analysis of the test results have shown that the grisms flight models for NISP are within specifications with an efficiency better than 70% on the spectral bandpass and a wavefront error on surfaces better than 30nm RMS. The components have withstood vibration qualification level up to 11.6g RMS in random test and vacuum cryogenics test down to 130K with measurement of optical quality in transmission. The EUCLID grisms flight models have been delivered to NISP project in November 2017 after the test campaign done at LAM that has demonstrated the compliance to the specifications."

DSL development tools like language workbenches (e.g., Spoofax) neither deal with the backend weaving nor handle the composition of DSALs. DSAL composition frameworks (e.g., Awesome) do not provide frontend development tools. DSAL code transformation approaches (e.g., XAspects) do not preserve the semantics of DSAL programs in the presence of other aspect languages. We extend AspectJ with a small set of annotations and interfaces that allows DSAL designers to define a semantic-preserving transformation to AspectJ and interface with AspectJ tools. Our transformation approach enables the use of standard language workbench to implement DSALs and use of standard aspect development tools to program with those DSALs. As a result, DSALs regain first-class status with respect to both DSLs and aspect languages. This, on the one hand, lowers the cost of developing DSALs to the level of DSLs and, on the other hand, raises the effectiveness of using a DSAL to the level of a GPAL. Consequently, LOM becomes cost-effective compared to the LOP baseline. We modified the ajc compiler to support our approach. Using two different language workbenches (Spoofax and Xtext) we then implemented several DSALs. AspectJ was supported out-of-the-box. We implemented Cool to demonstrate that the non-trivial composition of AspectJ and Cool can be accommodated using our approach. We applied LOM to crosscutting concerns in two open source projects (oVirt and muCommander), implementing in the process application-specific DSALs, thus providing a sense of the decrease in the cost of developing composable DSALs and the increase in the effectiveness of programming with them. Crosscutting concerns remain a problem in modern real-world projects (e.g., as observed in oVirt). DSALs are often the right tool for addressing these concerns. Our work makes LOM practical, thus facilitating use of DSAL solutions in the software development process."

As validation, we implemented a simple, though nontrivial web application using the proposed separation of assets.

By this separation, host application developers can focus mostly on the extra-functional aspects of a web application, namely on improving performance, scalability, and availability, while developers of an embedded application can focus on the functional aspects of their application, without worrying about extra- functional concerns.

The auto and chemical industries paid for fake studies to promote the safety of lead just like the tobacco companies did for their products even though they *knew* they were dangerous. And the reason lead was eventually taken out of gasoline wasn't a health or safety or environmental concern, it was because leaded gas ruined catalytic converters.\n\nIf you have a problem with the tone I'm sorry, but this one issue that absolutely is not murky or nuanced. These companies knew the dangers, knew the alternatives and *purposely* put everyone at risk for the sake of profits. And they only changed their ways when that thing became less profitable.\n"

Such a joint estimation poses however a few challenges, notably the selection of a valid regularizer that can quantify such spatial similarities. We propose in this work a new procedure that can do so while taking into account the geometrical structure of the cortex. We call this procedure Minimum Wasserstein Estimates (MWE). The benefits of this model are twofold. First, joint inference allows to pool together the data of different brain geometries, accumulating more spatial information. Second, MWE are defined through Optimal Transport (OT) metrics which provide a tool to model spatial proximity between cortical sources of different subjects, hence not enforcing identical source location in the group. These benefits allow MWE to be more accurate than standard MEG source localization techniques. To support these claims, we perform source localization on realistic MEG simulations based on forward operators derived from MRI scans. On a visual task dataset, we demonstrate how MWE infer neural patterns similar to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) maps."

Early humans, as hunter-gatherers, recognized and worked within the parameters of the complex systems in nature and their lives were circumscribed by the realities of nature.  But they couldn't explain complex systems.  Only in recent centuries did the need arise to define complex systems scientifically.    Complex systems theories first developed in math in the late 19th century, then in biology in the 1920s to explain ecosystems, then to deal with artificial intelligence (cybernetics), to date, the direction of research on the evolution of intelligent systems has been identified .\nAnthropologist Gregory Bateson is the most influential and earliest propagator of systems theory in social sciences.  In the 1940s, as a result of the Macy conferences, he immediately recognized its application to human societies with their many variables and the flexible but sustainable balance that they maintain.  Bateson describes system as \"any unit containing feedback structure and therefore competent to process information.\" Thus an open system allows interaction between concepts and materiality or subject and the environment or abstract and real. In natural science, systems theory has been a widely used approach. Austrian biologist, Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy, developed the idea of the general systems theory (GST). The GST is a multidisciplinary approach of system analysis.\n\n"

We took long series of 10s infrared exposures with the ESO-NTT telescope toward stellar populations located behind visible nebulae and toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We therefore searched for stars exhibiting stochastic flux variations similar to what is expected from the scintillation effect. According to our simulations of the scintillation process, this search should allow one to detect (stochastic) transverse gradients of column density in cool Galactic molecular clouds of order of $\\sim 3\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^2/10\\,000\\,km}$. Results: We found one light-curve that is compatible with a strong scintillation effect through a turbulent structure characterized by a diffusion radius $R_{diff}<100\\, km$ in the B68 nebula. Complementary observations are needed to clarify the status of this candidate, and no firm conclusion can be established from this single observation. We can also infer limits on the existence of turbulent dense cores (of number density $n>10^9\\, cm^{-3}$) within the dark nebulae. Because no candidate is found toward the SMC, we are also able to establish upper limits on the contribution of gas clumpuscules to the Galactic halo mass. Conclusions: The limits set by this test do not seriously constrain the known models, but we show that the short time-scale monitoring for a few $10^6 star\\times hour$ in the visible band with a $>4$ meter telescope and a fast readout camera should allow one to quantify the contribution of turbulent molecular gas to the Galactic halo. The LSST (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) is perfectly suited for this search."

Large-scale radial motions do exist, but these are only present at larger radii r>6kpc). This unsettled gas is mainly part of a tail/arm like structure. The relatively regular kinematics of the gas in this structure suggests that it is in the process of settling down into the main disk. The presence of this structure further supports the merger/interaction origin of the HI in Cen A. From the structure and kinematics we estimate a timescale of 1.6-3.2*10^{8}yr since the merging event. No bar structure is needed to describe the kinematics of the HI. The comparison of the timescale derived from the large-scale HI structure and those of the radio structure together with the relative regularity of the HI down to the sub-kpc regions does not suggest a one-to-one correspondence between the merger and the phase of radio activity. Interestingly, the radial motions of the outer regions are such that the projected velocities are redshifted compared to the regular orbits. This means that the blueshifted absorption discovered earlier and discussed in our previous paper cannot be caused by out-moving gas at large radius projected onto the centre. Therefore, the interpretation of the blueshifted absorption, together with at least a fraction of the redshifted nuclear absorption, as evidence for a regular inner disk, still holds. Finally, we also report the discovery of two unresolved clouds detected at 5.2 and 11kpc away (in projection) from the HI disk. They are likely an other example of left-over of the merger that brought the HI gas."

The UV radiative properties of kap^1 Cet indicate that its flux is some 35% lower than the current Sun's between 210 and 300 nm, it matches the Sun's at 170 nm and increases to at least 2-7 times higher than the Sun's between 110 and 140 nm. The use of several indicators ascribes an age to kap^1 Cet in the interval ~0.4-0.8 Gyr and the analysis of the theoretical HR diagram suggests a mass ~1.04 Msun. This star is thus a very close analog of the Sun when life arose on Earth and Mars is thought to have lost its surface bodies of liquid water. Photochemical models indicate that the enhanced UV emission leads to a significant increase in photodissociation rates compared with those commonly assumed of the early Earth. Our results show that reliable calculations of the chemical composition of early planetary atmospheres need to account for the stronger solar photodissociating UV irradiation."

NATO aircraft provided Close Air Support during the operation, which ended on November 6/7.\nDuring the mission, a Norwegian sniper with the 2nd Battalion hit one of the Taliban insurgents from a distance of 1,380 meters on the first shot, using a Barret M82A1 . Another Norwegian sniper team shot and killed a Taliban insurgent from a distance of approximately 2,010 meters, although not a first round hit. Several targets were engaged with the Barrett, some of them almost 3000 meters away.\nIn the aftermath, a Norwegian soldier was killed in an IED attack in Maimana on November 8.\nANA's 209th Corps took over control of the district on the same day.\nSubsequent to the battle, a number of soldiers from the Norwegian Military Observer Team Navy (unit made up of soldiers from the Kystjegerkommandoen) were awarded the US Army's Commendation Medal, for their efforts in expelling the Taliban from the Ghowrmach district.\nOperation Harekate Yolo was the combat debut of the CV90 armoured vehicle, used by the Norwegian Army.\n\n"

The irreversibility of quantum dynamics is properly characterized using the canonical wave functions/natural orbitals, and the associated canonical occupation probabilities, which provide the smallest possible representation of any fermionic many-body wave function. In this basis, one can evaluate the orbital entanglement entropy, which is an excellent measure of the non-equilibrium dynamics of an isolated system. To explore the phenomena of memory effects and irreversibility, we investigate the use of canonical wave functions/natural orbitals in nuclear many-body calculations, assessing their utility for static calculations, dynamics, and symmetry restoration. As the number of single-particle states is generally quite large, it is highly desirable to work in the canonical basis whenever possible, preferably with a cutoff. We show that truncating the number of canonical wave functions can be a valid approach in the case of static calculations, but that such a truncation is not valid for time-dependent calculations, as it leads to the violation of continuity equation, energy conservation, and other observables, as well as an inaccurate representation of the dynamics. Indeed, in order to describe the dynamics of a fissioning system within a TDDFT framework all the canonical states must be included in the calculation. Finally, we demonstrate that the canonical representation provides a very efficient basis for performing symmetry projections."

In this respect, many efforts have been devoted to prepare entangled states in atomic ensembles because of their high degree of coherence and their potential for precision measurement. Spin squeezed states as well as number states have been produced following methods based either on coherent evolution in the presence of a non-linearity in the atomic field [3--5], or on quantum non-demolition measurement [6--8]. Among methods of the first kind, cavity feedback [5, 9] is one of the most promising: it has already allowed for the creation of highly squeezed states [5] and the effective non-linearity introduced by the atom-cavity coupling can be easily switched off, making it very attractive for metrol-ogy applications. In this Letter, we analyze the entangled states that can be produced by cavity feedback in different coupling regimes from weak to strong, and derive the ultimate limits of the metrology gain, extending the optimization of squeezing to unexplored domains of parameters values. After optimization of both the coupling strength and the atom number, we find a maximum squeezing limit that depends only on the atomic structure."

That's why you're plunging and that's why it's backing up right there and leaking out. A toilet is a gravity flow device and if there isn't a clean 'drop' it backs up. You can see that the wax ring is not really any kind of a high-pressure seal because you're not supposed to have any real pressure there. It could be roots, it could be anything. How are the other drains? A little slow perhaps? It doesn't need to be fully blocked to not work properly.\n\nI would call a plumber, honestly. He'll be equipped to run a snake through the waste line and find out what's what. If it's roots or something your regular drain snake will not really remove them; it will just puch a hole through letting the water flow but leaving the waste and roots behind to back up again sometime. You would need something with a cutter head. Most can also run a CCTV camera down there to observe the issue if at first they don't succeed.

So from what I read in the article, she did in fact consent to anything up to and including her own death by gunshot, stabbing, strangulation, or whatever else.\n\nA person could argue that if someone had successfully completed a sexual act with her that it wasn't \"technically\" rape, but doesn't the thought of that disturb you in the least?  The whole point of this experiment was to expose the darker impulses of humanity and considering how she was stripped naked, drawn on, cut, and other arguably horrible acts, it arguably succeeded.\n\nI'd say that if someone did in fact perform a sexual act on her using the argument she had \"consented\" to it happening it says a lot more about the person performing the act than it did about any sort of \"permission\" she may have \"granted\" the person doing it.\n\nIf a person had in fact done so that day, and then told people afterwards \"yes I had consensual sex with a woman who was unable to resist\" I'm pretty sure most people would call that rape.  Even though on purely technical grounds she \"consented\" to the act.\nidm: I don't see sex as inherently evil, or aggressive, or violent. So in my mind, if a woman of sound mind walked up to me and said \"here is my body, do with it as you please\", and I was single, the first thing on my mind would be sex. The attempted sex act would include positive touch to bring pleasure to the other party. That doesn't sound like rape to me. \n\nI'd like to know why you believe the implication of that is \"the darker impulses of Humanity\". Do you believe the act of sex is inherently evil or aggressive or violent?\nPhilo_T_Farnsworth: &gt; So in my mind, if a woman of sound mind walked up to me and said \"here is my body, do with it as you please\"\n\nAre you actually trying to say that's what happened in this performance?

Results from the geometrical modeling give us clues to the presence of aluminum and silicate dust in the close circumstellar environment (< ~5 stellar radii). Comparison between spectro-interferometric data and a self-consistent dust-driven wind model reveals that silicate dust has to be present in the region between 2 to 3 stellar radii to reproduce the 59 and 63 m baseline visibility measurements around 9.8 micron. This gives additional observational evidence in favor of winds driven by photon scattering on iron-free silicate grains located in the close vicinity of an M-type star. However, other sources of opacity are clearly missing to reproduce the 10-13 micron visibility measurements for all baselines. This study is a first attempt to understand the wind mechanism of M-type AGB stars by comparing photometric, spectrometric, and interferometric measurements with state-of-the-art, self-consistent dust-driven wind models. The agreement of the dynamic model atmosphere with interferometric measurements in the 8-10 micron spectral region gives additional observational evidence that the winds of M-type stars can be driven by photon scattering on iron-free silicate grains. Finally, a larger statistical study and progress in advanced self-consistent 3D modeling are still required to solve the remaining problems."

Therefore, we also study the relationship between formulas and specific traces. Knowledge: We find several misconceptions that have consequences for learners, tool builders, and designers of new property languages. These findings are already resulting in changes to the Alloy modeling language. We also find that the English to LTL direction was the most common source of errors; unfortunately, this is the critical \"authoring\" direction in which a subtle mistake can lead to a faulty system. We contribute study instruments that are useful for training learners (whether academic or industrial) who are getting acquainted with LTL, and we provide a code book to assist in the analysis of responses to similar-style questions. Grounding: Our findings are grounded in the responses to our survey rounds. Round 1 used Quizius to identify misconceptions among learners in a way that reduces the threat of expert blind spots. Rounds 2 and 3 confirm that both additional learners and researchers (who work in formal methods, robotics, and related fields) make similar errors. Round 4 adds deep support for our misconceptions via talk-aloud surveys. Importance This work provides useful answers to two critical but unexplored questions: in what ways is LTL tricky and what can be done about it?

We also compute the value of secondary critical fields that increment the quantized vorticity. 1. Introdution This article studies the pinning phenomenon in type-II superconducting composites. Superconductivity is a property that appears in certain materials cooled below a critical temperature. These materials are called superconductors. Superconductivity is characterized by a total absence of electrical resistance and a perfect diamagnetism. Unfortunately, when the imposed conditions are too intense, superconductivity is destroyed in certain areas of the material called vorticity defects. We are interested in type II superconductors which are characterized by the fact that the vorticity defects first appear in small areas. Their number increases with the intensity of the conditions imposed until filling the material. For example, when the intensity h ex of an applied magnetic field exceeds a first threshold, the first vorticity defects appear: the magnetic field begins to penetrate the superconductor. The penetration is done along thin wires and may move resulting an energy dissipation. These motions may be limited by trapping the vorticity defects in small areas. The behavior of a superconductor is modeled by minimizers of a Ginzburg-Landau type energy. In order to study the presence of traps for the vorticity defects we consider an energy including a pinning term that models impurities in the supercon-ductor. These impurities would play the role of traps for the vorticity defects. We are thus lead to the subject of this article: the type-II superconducting composites with impurities."

Together, these properties set it apart from many deployment tools that center on the distribution of binaries. This paper focuses on one research question: how can Guix and similar systems allow users to securely update their software? Guix source code is distributed using the Git version control system; updating Guix-installed software packages means, first, updating the local copy of the Guix source code. Prior work on secure software updates focuses on systems very different from Guix -- systems such as Debian, Fedora, or PyPI where updating consists in fetching metadata about the latest binary artifacts available -- and is largely inapplicable in the context of Guix. By contrast, the main threats for Guix are attacks on its source code repository, which could lead users to run inauthentic code or to downgrade their system. Deployment tools that more closely resemble Guix, from Nix to Portage, either lack secure update mechanisms or suffer from shortcomings. Our main contribution is a model and tool to authenticate new Git revisions. We further show how, building on Git semantics, we build protections against downgrade attacks and related threats. We explain implementation choices. This work has been deployed in production two years ago, giving us insight on its actual use at scale every day. The Git checkout authentication at its core is applicable beyond the specific use case of Guix, and we think it could benefit to developer teams that use Git. As attacks on the software supply chain appear, security research is now looking at every link of the supply chain. Secure updates are one important aspect of the supply chain, but this paper also looks at the broader context: how Guix models and implements the supply chain, from upstream source code to binaries running on computers. While much recent work focuses on attestation -- certifying each link of the supply chain -- Guix takes a more radical approach: enabling independent verification of each step, building on reproducible builds, \"bootstrappable\" builds, and provenance tracking. The big picture shows how Guix can be used as the foundation of secure software supply chains."

Analysis stages of the CAD model particularly induce this time increase which is required for a wise choice of cutting tools and machining strategies. Assistance modules for prismatic parts machining features identification in CAD models are widely implemented in CAM software. In spite of the last CAM evolutions, these kinds of CAM modules are undeveloped for aeronautical structure parts and forging dies. Development of new CAM modules for the extraction of relevant machining areas as well as the definition of the topological relations between these areas must make it possible for the machining assistant to reduce the machining preparation time. In this paper, a model developed for the description of complex shape parts topology is presented. It is based on machining areas extracted for the construction of geometrical features starting from CAD models of the parts. As topology is described in order to assist machining assistant during machining process generation, the difficulties associated with tasks he carried out are analyzed at first. The topological model presented after is based on the basic geometrical features extracted. Topological relations which represent the framework of the model are defined between the basic geometrical features which are gathered afterwards in macro-features. Approach used for the identification of these macro-features is also presented in this paper. Detailed application on the construction of the topological model of forging dies is presented in the last part of the paper."

Unless it is a double purpose card credit/debit, I don't understand how that can make sense. I never tried to run a debit card as credit. \nwanderingbilby: It's just confusion of nomenclature.  In this context:\n\n* Credit - \"Deferred verification\" - The debit card is swiped, and the customer signs for the purchase.  The purchase shows pending immediately on the checking account and clears in a few business days.  Called deferred verification because the verification of the purchase authorization comes when the merchant batches the transaction.  Also applies for all non-swiped transactions (online, telephone).\n\n* Debit - \"Immediate verification\" - The debit card is swiped and the customer enters their ATM PIN on a keypad.  The purchase shows pending immediately on the checking account and typically posts at the end of that business day.  Called immediate verification as the verification of authorization happens at the time of sale (via PIN verification).\n\n\nIn both cases the funds are *debiting* the checking account.\n\n**Note:** Some banks have a system where if you enter a PIN it comes from the checking account and if you swipe-and-sign it comes from an associated credit line.  Personally I think it's dumb since many merchants (and all online) don't have a PIN option.\nfer_d: Seems like a leftover from and old system, then? I don't understand the purpose, maybe it would be taken from your account the next day instead of immediately.\n\nAnd if the costumer can choose, then the merchant really has no control and has to use whatever the costumer decided. \nwanderingbilby: The way credit cards work period is a hold-over from the early days of the concept, when there was no way to electronically verify authorization.  Cards were recorded or carbon-copied on a machine that took an imprint, then the customer signed.  The paper copies were processed much like checks.  Now it's processed electronically but the same way - once a day at the end of the day as a 'batch' transmission.\n\nThe \"pending\" transaction you see immediately is simply the bank notifying you that they authorized a merchant to debit funds later.  How much later is the number of days it takes to go from \"pending\" to \"posted\".  Posted is when the funds actually leave the account and go to the merchant.\n\nPIN-Authorization is a newer system and was proposed as a method to allow customers to get cash back during the transaction and to reduce fraud.  It requires more equipment (the PIN pad) so there are still many small merchants that only have swipe-and-sign as an option.\n\nMerchants can have control by either not offering the PIN option or by de-emphasizing the option (having the PIN pad behind the counter, for instance).\n\nPlaces such as restaurants and bars rarely have the PIN option as you pay at the table rather than at a centralized POS system.\nfer_d: Thanks. Yes, that makes sense. \n"

Such irrelevance cannot be deduced apriori, since it depends on the details of the task, and is thus inherently ill defined in the purely unsupervised case. Separating relevant from irrelevant features can be achieved using additional side data that contains such irrelevant structures. This approach was taken in [CT-2002], extending the information bottleneck method, which uses clustering to compress the data. Here we use this side-information framework to identify features whose measurements are maximally informative for the original data set, but carry as little information as possible on a side data set. In statistical terms this can be understood as extracting statistics which are maximally sufficient for the original dataset, while simultaneously maximally ancillary for the side dataset. We formulate this tradeoff as a constrained optimization problem and characterize its solutions. We then derive a gradient descent algorithm for this problem, which is based on the Generalized Iterative Scaling method for finding maximum entropy distributions. The method is demonstrated on synthetic data, as well as on real face recognition datasets, and is shown to outperform standard methods such as oriented PCA."

In addition, a total of 59 indoor dust samples from six countries including Australia (n=10), Belgium (n=10), Colombia (n=10), Japan (n=10), Thailand (n=10) and the United States of America (n=9) were analysed for BCAs. BCAs were detected in seven samples from the USA, with carbon chain lengths of C8, C10, C12, C14, C16, C18, C24 to C28, C30 and C31 observed overall, though not detected in samples from any other countries. Bromination of detected homologues in the indoor dust samples ranged from Br1-4 as well as Br7, while chlorine numbers ranged from Cl2-11. BCA-C18 were the most frequently detected, observed in each of the USA samples, while the most prevalent halogenation degrees were homologues of Br2 and Cl4-5. Broad estimations of BCA concentrations in the dust samples indicated that levels may approach those of other flame retardants in at least some instances. These findings suggest that development of quantification strategies and further investigation of environmental occurrence and health implications are needed."

We propose an objective procedure for the determination of these two parameters. The proof of concept described here is applied to simulated ERT (electrical resistivity tomography) sections, for the following three cases: two layers with a step, two layers with a rebound, and two layers with an anomaly embedded in the upper layer. To validate this approach, sensitivity studies were carried out on both of the above parameters, as well as to assess the influence of noise on the algorithm's performance. Finally, this methodology was tested on real field data. DBSCAN detects clusters in the inverted electrical resistivity models, and the former are then associated with various types of earth materials, thus allowing the structure of the prospected area to be determined. The proposed data-mining algorithm is shown to be effective, and to improve the interpretation of the inverted ERT sections. This new approach has considerable potential, as it can be applied to any geophysical data represented in the form of sections or maps."

The model is parameterized as a function of mean visible and thermal opacities, respectively. The model is shown to reproduce relatively well temperature profiles obtained from more sophisticated radiative transfer calculations of exoplanetary atmospheres. It naturally explains why a temperature inversion (stratosphere) appears when the opacity in the optical becomes significant compared to that in the infrared. I further show that the mean equivalent flux (proportional to T^4) is conserved in the presence of horizontal advection on constant optical depth levels. This implies with these hypotheses that the deep atmospheric temperature used as outer boundary for the evolution models should be calculated from models pertaining to the entire planetary atmosphere, not from ones that are relevant to the day side or to the substellar point. In these conditions, present-day models yield deep temperatures that are ~1000K too cold to explain the present size of planet HD 209458b. An tenfold increase in the infrared to visible opacity ratio would be required to slow the planetary cooling and contraction sufficiently to explain its size. However, the mean equivalent flux is not conserved anymore in the presence of opacity variations, or in the case of non-radiative vertical transport of energy: The presence of clouds on the night side or a downward transport of kinetic energy and its dissipation at deep levels would help making the deep atmosphere hotter and may explain the inflated sizes of giant exoplanets."
