Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket.

I mean, I'm not saying I'm not interested in getting to know people or having fun, but it's hard to reconcile the desire to be authentic with the pressure to be exciting. And what's even more frustrating is that it seems like everyone around me is living this amazing, thrilling life, and I'm just over here, stuck in my routine, wondering why I'm not more exciting.\nI've tried to put myself out there, to take risks and do new things, but it's hard to shake the feeling that I'm just going through the motions. And when I do try to be more outgoing, it feels forced, like I'm putting on a show for someone else's benefit. I don't want to be that person, but at the same time, I don't want to be stuck in this rut forever.\nI guess what I'm really asking is, has anyone else ever felt like this? Like, they're stuck between being themselves and trying to be someone else? And if so, how did you deal with it? Did you find a way to be more authentic, or did you learn to adapt and be more outgoing? I'm really curious to hear your thoughts on this.\nAnd who knows, maybe someone out there will read this and say, \"Hey, I'm boring too!

I feel like guys who party and drink have it easier with girls. Please don't give me bull$hit that i need to find someone with same interests because i tried and (especially girls) are more into instagram/snapchat than real talk. \nI think deep inside i know that my life is mostly sitting in front of my computer and thats the reason im not doing well on dates, i just know that sooner or later any girl will leave me as i don't go out to clubs and parties. Any tips what should i do ? Im 24yo btw. Thanks\nghxststories: Well i think your problem may be that you think girls are only interested in snapchat and instagram.\nJust you know.\nComing from a female designer/programmer who thought you sounded pretty dope til I read that line.\nfuckyeapancakes: So you don't expect a guy to take you somewhere cool on a date ? You don't need to show up to your friends party to show yourself with a bf ? Im sorry but pretty much all females i've met so far were like that. How am i supposed to think differently when life long experience days otherwise ?\nghxststories: No, I don't go to parties or have partners to show them off! Yeah I expect cool dates, but to me thatd be going to mini golf or an arcade or just getting take out and watching a movie. \nI think youre looking in the wrong places, or going after the wrong kind of girls for you :) \nAlso, 24 is still young, im 27 now and only just figuring out what im into, your life experience is probably college age girls and guys who dont have it figured out yet, maybe ya gotta go for an older lady!\nEither way, suggesting an entire gender are only into one thing, probs not the best way to go about it.\nfuckyeapancakes: What are good places then ? Please don't write \"everywhere\" i need specific tips, i also suspect that most girls i would be into, are hiding in their houses :/ i don't think 24 is that young, it's not old yet either but most people around me have it figured out\nghxststories: I think the hardest part no doubt is putting yourself out there, I feel like youre already destining yourself to fail thinking you'll bore people, but as cheesy as it sounds, as long as youre passionate about something that will shine through and make you seem interesting. And if people aint interested in you for what youre intested in, fuck em.\nIf you've got your stuff sorted at 24, damn well work that! Appreciate yourself for a while, and dont rush to try and find someone else. I was scared to be single for so long, and now I am learning to embrace it.\nShe says, binge eating cheese and watching jumanji \ud83d\ude04\nfuckyeapancakes: Ok thanks, im actually trying my best to look for people online but people seem to be more picky and not-easily-impressed when online.

Both teams were tied at 8 points going into the Sunday singles matches. Sam Torrance had put most of his best players out early while Curtis Strange had opted to do the opposite. Momentum swung for Europe and after Phillip Price defeated Phil Mickelson 3 & 2, Europe needed 1\u20442 point for victory. The decisive 1\u20442 point was secured by Paul McGinley in his match against Jim Furyk after he holed a 10-foot par putt on the 18th hole.\nThe victory prompted Tony Blair\n\nText continuation:\n, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time, to congratulate the European team on their impressive win. He hailed the team's achievement as a \"great triumph\" and praised their determination and teamwork. The team's captain, Sam Torrance, was also thrilled with the result, saying it was a \"dream come true\" for him and the entire European team.\nThe European team's victory was met with widespread celebration across the continent, with fans in England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland all rejoicing at the team's success. The win was seen as a major boost for European golf, and it marked a significant turning point in the rivalry between the European and American teams. The victory also sparked a renewed sense of pride and patriotism among the European fans, who had been eagerly following the competition.\nIn the aftermath of the win, the European team was hailed as heroes by the media and the public.

Britain in Europe at its best. Me and George Bush on opposite sides\".\nThe event was originally scheduled for 28\u201330 September 2001 but was postponed for a year on 16 September following the September 11 attacks. \"The PGA of America has informed the European Ryder Cup Board that the scope of the last Tuesday's tragedy is so overwhelming that it would not be possible for the United States Ryder Cup team and officials to attend the match this month.\" The manager of Phil Mickelson and Mark Calcavecchia had earlier announced that the two players would not travel to Europe. Other American players were said to be concerned about attending the event. It was agreed that the same captains and players would participate in the 2002 event.\nIt was later decided to thereafter play matches in even-numbered years instead of odd-numbered, shifting the already-scheduled 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013 editions to 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014, respectively.  This in turn caused a corresponding change in schedules for the Presidents Cup, Solheim Cup, and Seve Trophy (all of which are played in years the Ryder Cup is not played). The Presidents Cup was in turn delayed by a year, while both the Solheim Cup and Seve Trophy played their 2002 matches as scheduled then subsequently started playing in odd-numbered years in 2003. The Junior Ryder Cup, which was also scheduled for 2001, was rescheduled for 2002.

Cluster bombs are usually air-dropped shells that eject multiple small bomblets to kill enemy soldiers. A document released by Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs says the countries agreed never to use cluster munitions or the explosive bomblets they contain. The countries also agreed never to develop, acquire, retain or transfer cluster munitions. Countries attending the 11-day conference agreed to the treaty Wednesday but formally signed it Friday. The accord calls for a total, immediate ban of the weapons, strong standards to protect those injured by them, contaminated areas to be cleaned up as quickly as possible and for the weapons to be immediately destroyed, he said. Thomas Nash, coordinator of the CMC campaigning organization, said Wednesday: \"This is a great achievement for everyone who has been working hard to see the end of 40 years of suffering from these weapons.\" Though some of the biggest makers of cluster bombs, including the United States, Russia, China and Israel, were not involved in the talks and have not signed the accord, organizers predicted that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance. \"Take the United States,\" Nash said. \"Almost all of its allies are here. They've decided to ban these weapons. That's going to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to ever use these weapons again, either on its own or in joint operations.\" The agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years, he said. Cluster munitions, which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets, are what the International Committee of the Red Cross calls a \"persistent humanitarian problem.\" Most of a cluster bomb's bomblets are meant to explode on impact, but many do not. Estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time, the Red Cross says. That means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area, often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians. Last week, Acting Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Stephen D. Mull called it \"an absolute moral obligation\" to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle. But he also predicted that the United States would not agree to any ban. \"We think that it is going to be impossible to ban cluster munitions... because these are weapons that have a certain military utility and are of use,\" Mull said. \"The United States relies on them as an important part of our own defense strategy.\" Instead, he urged that the weapons be regulated \"to take humanitarian considerations into account\" and that \"technological fixes\" be pursued that would render them harmless after a battle. During the 34-day war in Lebanon in 2006, the United Nations estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets, 1 million of which may not have exploded, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. More than 250 civilians and bomb-disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern Lebanon since the war ended. Cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in Kosovo. Lt. Col. Jim Burke, a military adviser to the Irish Defense Forces said they quickly became a major killer of civilians. In more than 20 countries, according to the ICRC, cluster bombs have created lasting \"no-go\" areas, rendering them as dangerous as minefields. Laos is the most affected country. Millions of bomblets dropped during the Vietnam War continue to kill civilians more than three decades later. Still, militaries consider cluster bombs important for use against multiple targets dispersed over a wide area, such as tanks or military personnel moving across the landscape. A single bomb containing hundreds of submunitions can cover more than 18 square miles.

Cluster bombs are usually air-dropped shells that eject multiple small bomblets to kill enemy soldiers. A document released by Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs says the countries agreed never to use cluster munitions or the explosive bomblets they contain. The countries also agreed never to develop, acquire, retain or transfer cluster munitions. Countries attending the 11-day conference agreed to the treaty Wednesday but formally signed it Friday. The accord calls for a total, immediate ban of the weapons, strong standards to protect those injured by them, contaminated areas to be cleaned up as quickly as possible and for the weapons to be immediately destroyed, he said. Thomas Nash, coordinator of the CMC campaigning organization, said Wednesday: \"This is a great achievement for everyone who has been working hard to see the end of 40 years of suffering from these weapons.\" Though some of the biggest makers of cluster bombs, including the United States, Russia, China and Israel, were not involved in the talks and have not signed the accord, organizers predicted that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance. \"Take the United States,\" Nash said. \"Almost all of its allies are here. They've decided to ban these weapons. That's going to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to ever use these weapons again, either on its own or in joint operations.\" The agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years, he said. Cluster munitions, which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets, are what the International Committee of the Red Cross calls a \"persistent humanitarian problem.\" Most of a cluster bomb's bomblets are meant to explode on impact, but many do not. Estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time, the Red Cross says. That means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area, often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians. Last week, Acting Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Stephen D. Mull called it \"an absolute moral obligation\" to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle. But he also predicted that the United States would not agree to any ban. \"We think that it is going to be impossible to ban cluster munitions... because these are weapons that have a certain military utility and are of use,\" Mull said. \"The United States relies on them as an important part of our own defense strategy.\" Instead, he urged that the weapons be regulated \"to take humanitarian considerations into account\" and that \"technological fixes\" be pursued that would render them harmless after a battle.

It appeared important to get a precise knowledge of these scan parameters' normal values during the first trimester. This paper focused on crown-rump length. --- METHODS --- 402 pregnancies from in-vitro fertilization allowing a precise estimation of foetal ages (FA) were used to determine the best model that describes crown-rump length (CRL) as a function of FA. Scan measures by a single operator from 3846 spontaneous pregnancies representative of the general population from Northern France were used to build a mathematical\n\nText continuation:\nmodel. The model was then validated using an independent dataset of 1000 pregnancies. The results showed that the best model was a polynomial function of degree three, which accurately described the relationship between CRL and FA.\nThe study found that the mean CRL at 11 weeks was 54.2 mm, increasing to 63.1 mm at 12 weeks and 72.4 mm at 13 weeks. The standard deviation of CRL at each gestational age was found to be 2.5 mm, 2.8 mm, and 3.1 mm, respectively. The model was also used to estimate the normal range of CRL for each gestational age, which was found to be between 49.4 mm and 59.3 mm at 11 weeks, 55.4 mm and 65.5 mm at 12 weeks, and 61.4 mm and 73.1 mm at 13 weeks.\nThe findings of this study are important for clinicians as they provide a precise knowledge of the normal range of CRL during the first trimester. This information can be used to improve the accuracy of foetal age estimation and to identify pregnancies at risk of Down's syndrome. The study also highlights the importance of using a single operator to perform the scans, as this can reduce the variability in the measurements and improve the accuracy of the results.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"c\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "###"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

We modeled both CRL as a function of FA and FA as a function of CRL. For this, we used a clear methodology and performed regressions with heteroskedastic corrections and robust regressions. The results were compared by cross-validation to retain the equations with the best predictive power. We also studied the errors between observed and predicted values. --- Results --- Data from 513 spontaneous pregnancies allowed to model CRL as a function of age of foetal age. The best model was a polynomial of degree 2. Datation with our equation that models spontaneous pregnancies from a general population was in quite agreement with objective datations obtained from 402 IVF pregnancies and thus support the validity of our model. The most precise measure of CRL was when the SD was minimal (1.83mm), for a CRL of 23.6 mm where our model predicted a 49.4 days of foetal age. Our study allowed to model the SD from 30 to 90 days of foetal age and offers the opportunity of using Zscores in the future to detect growth abnormalities. --- Conclusion --- With powerful statistical tools we report a good modeling of the first trimester embryonic growth in the general population allowing a better knowledge of the date of fertilization useful in the ultrasound screening of Down's syndrome. The optimal period to measure CRL and predict foetal age was 49.4 days (9 weeks of gestational age). Our results open the way to the detection of foetal growth abnormalities using CRL Zscores throughout the first trimester.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Kyrgyzstan\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "###"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The Canadian frigate HMCS Ville de Quebec will escort ships carrying food aid to Somalia. \"Canada is stepping up to the plate by tasking Ville de Quebec with the role of escorting World Food Programme ships to ensure their safe arrival at designated ports,\" Canadian Defense Minister Peter MacKay said in a government news release. The United Nations hunger program praised Canada for answering its call for help, and said it hoped other governments would step forward to take over from Canada once it completes its mission in a few weeks. The HMCS Ville de Quebec is a 440-foot frigate armed with torpedoes, surface-to-air missiles and other weapons, and carries a twin-engine Sea King anti-submarine helicopter. Ville de Quebec, which can travel at speeds greater than 27 knots, will be dispatched after Somalia's transitional government formally authorizes the mission, the government's news release said. WFP asked the world's naval powers in mid-June to help its ships reach the more than 2 million people in need of aid. It put out the request weeks before French, Danish and Dutch warships ended their escort missions, which began in November. Pirate attacks on unescorted ships have been a growing problem in Somalia. Three European freighters were hijacked off the Horn of Africa in June, adding to the 27 other reported attacks this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which tracks piracy. WFP delivers 80 percent of its aid to Somalia by sea, and WFP spokesman Peter Smerdon said that if there are no warships to escort the food supply, the program will have to rely on ground or air travel to deliver the food. But both are dangerous and expensive. The agency said that if there is no assistance from naval powers, piracy will increase, and so will death and malnutrition.

Many programming languages offer a variety of container implementations in their standard libraries based on data structures offering different capabilities and performance characteristics. Inquiry: Choosing the *best* container for an application is not always straightforward, as performance characteristics can change drastically in different scenarios, and as real-world performance is not always correlated to theoretical complexity. Approach: We present Primrose, a language-agnostic tool for selecting the best performing valid container implementation from a set of container data types that satisfy *properties\n\nText continuation:\n*.\nPrimrose uses a combination of techniques, including benchmarking, profiling, and machine learning algorithms, to identify the most suitable container implementation for a given application. The tool is designed to be highly flexible, allowing developers to easily integrate it into their development workflow and to adapt it to their specific needs. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the performance characteristics of different container implementations, Primrose helps developers make informed decisions about which container to use in their application.\nOne of the key benefits of Primrose is its ability to consider a wide range of factors that can affect the performance of a container implementation. These factors include the size and complexity of the data being stored, the frequency and pattern of data access, and the specific requirements of the application. By taking these factors into account, Primrose can provide a more accurate and relevant assessment of the performance characteristics of different container implementations.\nIn addition to its technical capabilities, Primrose is also designed to be easy to use and integrate into a development workflow. The tool provides a simple and intuitive interface that allows developers to easily specify the requirements of their application and to view the results of the analysis. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily identify the most suitable container implementation for their application.\nOverall, Primrose is a powerful tool that can help developers make informed decisions about which container implementation to use in their application. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the performance characteristics of different container implementations, Primrose can help developers optimize the performance of their application and improve the overall efficiency of their development workflow.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"u\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "###"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Many programming languages offer a variety of container implementations in their standard libraries based on data structures offering different capabilities and performance characteristics. Inquiry: Choosing the *best* container for an application is not always straightforward, as performance characteristics can change drastically in different scenarios, and as real-world performance is not always correlated to theoretical complexity. Approach: We present Primrose, a language-agnostic tool for selecting the best performing valid container implementation from a set of container data types that satisfy *properties\n\nText continuation:\n* given by application developers. Primrose automatically selects the set of valid container implementations for which the *library specifications*, written by the developers of container libraries, satisfies the specified properties. Finally, Primrose ranks the valid library implementations based on their runtime performance. Knowledge: With Primrose, application developers can specify the expected behaviour of a container as a type refinement with *semantic properties*, e.g., if the container should only contain unique values (such as a `set`) or should satisfy the LIFO property of a `stack`. Semantic properties nicely complement *syntactic properties* (i.e., traits, interfaces, or type classes), together allowing developers to specify a container's programming interface *and* behaviour without committing to a concrete implementation. Grounding: We present our prototype implementation of Primrose that preprocesses annotated Rust code, selects valid container implementations and ranks them on their performance. The design of Primrose is, however, language-agnostic, and is easy to integrate into other programming languages that support container data types and traits, interfaces, or type classes. Our implementation encodes properties and library specifications into verification conditions in Rosette, an interface for SMT solvers, which determines the set of valid container implementations. We evaluate Primrose by specifying several container implementations, and measuring the time taken to select valid implementations for various combinations of properties with the solver. We automatically validate that container implementations conform to their library specifications via property-based testing. Importance: This work provides a novel approach to bring abstract modelling and specification of container types directly into the programmer's workflow. Instead of selecting concrete container implementations, application programmers can now work on the level of specification, merely stating the behaviours they require from their container types, and the best implementation can be selected automatically.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Bhutan\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Isn't it just turn it back in when your done?\nLinkedPioneer: Sure, you can just turn the lease in when the lease ends. \nThat\u2019s beneficial to you if you have *negative equity* because you can just hand them the keys and walk away without paying a cent (unless you\u2019re over on miles and have to pay a mileage penalty.) \nBut if the car is worth *more* than the payoff amount you\u2019d be a fool to turn it in instead of selling it to a dealer.\nJoethemofoe: I guess I'm not understanding how a lease works\nLinkedPioneer: When a lease ends you typically have four options;\n1.) Turn in the car to a dealer and walk away\n2.) Buy out the lease\n3.) Trade it in towards a new vehicle\n4.) (If the car is worth MORE than what the lease payoff amount is) you can SELL the car to a dealer and get a check back for the equity!\nJoethemofoe: Your assuming they won't charge you makert value either\nCharmingTuber: No, that's the piece you're missing. The buyout price is set when you sign the lease. They know how cars depreciate, so it's all set in stone in your lease agreement.\nBut that was set two+years ago when the car market wasn't upsidedown. Now, you can buy it off at that original depreciation and sell it back at the current market rate.\nJoethemofoe: I get it now. I've never leased before only bought\nCharmingTuber: It's cool.

If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says journalists don't serve the public if they push rumors. (CNN) -- Two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the Internet. One week before comedian Bernie Mac passed away, text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died. I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead. The rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times. What makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition. Then there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards. The story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging. Ultimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened. There has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\" Sorry, Rick, I disagree. The most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control. Running with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion. The rumors kept going and going\u00ad and when the story hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire. In one week, Bear Stearns was no more, and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the Wall Street behemoth. We should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story. The rules are simple: Either you have the facts or you don't. If you do, you run with the story. If you don't, you leave it alone. The National Enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront Edwards as he was leaving the Beverly Hills Hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair. Then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the Enquirer said was the child of the mistress. With other major media outlets turning up the heat, Edwards admitted the affair in an interview with ABC's Bob Woodruff. No media executive should be pulling his or her hair out, trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor. If they had, and the facts didn't support the rumor, then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more. We have an obligation to stick with the facts, and nothing else. And no matter what a blogger, Web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with, the day we choose to alter our standards, our credibility and integrity will be shot. In the end, as former ABC News anchor Max Robinson said in 1988, that's all we've got.

Put it around the edge\n\nText continuation:\n...\nYou know, I think Wolfiesden has a point. If the purpose of the LED strip is to illuminate the animal head, it might be more effective to place it in a way that creates a subtle glow rather than a harsh, direct light. Maybe you could try placing it around the edges of the plaque or along the contours of the animal's body. This would create a soft, ambient light that adds depth and interest to the overall design without being too overpowering.\nAnother option would be to use a diffuser to soften the light emitted by the LED strip. This could be a transparent or translucent material that is placed over the strip to scatter the light and reduce its intensity. This would help to create a more subtle, even illumination that wouldn't be too overwhelming.\nOf course, if you're looking to make the LED strip more of a decoration, Wolfiesden's suggestion to place it around the edge of the plaque is a great idea. This would create a nice, subtle border that adds visual interest to the overall design without being too distracting. You could also consider using a different color or pattern for the LED strip to match the overall aesthetic of the plaque and animal head.\nUltimately, the key is to experiment and find the right balance between light and shadow. By playing around with different placements and intensities, you should be able to find a solution that works for your specific needs and creates a visually appealing display.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"w\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Put it around the edge\n\nText continuation:\n.  Think Bar rope lights.\nIf you are going eye-catcher but want subtle, don't put it on the front.  Make the mount so it stands off the wall an inch or so and angle the led strip outward and back so it illuminates the WALL around the plaque.  That would draw attention to it but not make it an in-your-face light making it hard to look into.  Here is the wall effect I am thinking:\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/01/a4/a7/01a4a71296c19077fe300113f7fe0eb5.jpg\n\nAnother option is to edge light plexi.  You would put a plexiglas plate between the head and the wood plate and edge light the plexiglass.  The plexi could be routed (standard router) with a design or if you have a laser cutter, plexi is extremely easy to cut and etch, expecially with a CO2 laser.  Mine cuts very quickly and etches very well.  Here is an edge lit sign to get an idea:\nhttp://www.valleydesignsnd.com/catalog/images/products/ac10212015_2.jpg\nAnother option to look at is tossing the LED thing and looking at EL wire.  Its very flexible, easy to work with and isn't extremely intense like LED is.  Is more of a subtle but distinctive look.  Doesn't put out much light so won't do anything for lighting up your head.  But for eyecandy effects, its hard to discount.  Its soft and flexible enough to be woven into clothes and has been used in halloween costumes for quite a few years now.  Here is an example off google (not endorsing this site, just has a decent pic): \nhttps://glowproducts.com/media/catalog/product/cache/5/thumbnail/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/e/l/el_wire_kits_gp2.jpg\nYusunoha: Thank you for your reply and all the information. \nTo quickly summarize the project that I have in mind, I have a giraffe animal head that I want to put on a plaque, and make it look like the imguraffe. Imgur is about the color green, so I had the idea of adding LED's to the plague that you can set to green.\nThe effect what I'm trying to go after though is having the head be illuminated in a dark room. Having the back of the plague is an option I considered, but I wanted to focus the light on the head than rather on the plague. And by diffusing the light you will not be directly staring into the light.\nI had not considered the edge lit option, I'll take it into consideration, but I think it may be a step too far for me.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Sweden\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the neighborhood, but I barely noticed. My mind was elsewhere, replaying all the negative thoughts and worries that had been plaguing me for weeks. I had to shake them off, though. I had to focus on the present moment and what I could control.\nAs I started my warm-up, my legs felt like lead and my lungs burned from lack of use. It was like my body was screaming at me to stop, to give up and go back to the comfort of my couch. But I pushed through the discomfort, gradually increasing my pace and intensity. The sweat started dripping down my face, and my muscles began to ache, but I kept going.\nThe first few reps of my workout were a struggle, but as I got into a rhythm, I started to feel a sense of accomplishment. I was doing it. I was taking control of my life, one rep at a time. The stress and anxiety that had been weighing me down started to lift, replaced by a sense of empowerment.\nAs I finished my workout and walked back into my apartment, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had faced my demons and come out on top. I knew that tomorrow would bring new challenges, but I was ready. I was ready to tackle whatever life threw my way, one rep at a time.\nAnd as I sat down to write this, I realized that maybe, just maybe, this little workout was more than just a physical exercise. Maybe it was a metaphor for life. Maybe it was a reminder that no matter how tough things get, we always have the power to take control, to push through the pain and come out stronger on the other side.\nI know that I still have a long way to go. I still have to face the uncertainty of my job search and the challenges of my relationship. But for now, I'm taking things one rep at a time. I'm taking control of my life, one workout at a time. And who knows, maybe someday I'll look back on this tough time and realize that it was the catalyst for something greater. Maybe someday I'll look back and say, \"You know what?

I'm not particularly flexible and my bridge kind of sucks, so I think it's important to keep stretching those muscles to get that synovial fluid in there. Followed up with a few L-Holds, and I was surprised to discover that I can actually hold my legs out almost straight with my butt almost completely off the ground for a couple seconds before collapsing. Couldn't even get my butt off the ground at all a few months ago. I rounded out the stretches with some twist holds and amazingly I can actually lock my hands behind my back on my right side. Left side is still pretty tight but I'm seeing slow progress with a hand towel. \n&amp;#x200B;\nOn to pushups. I started with just a few conventional pushups to get the blood circulating, and then a few close pushups. I migrated to one of the beer die tables in the backyard and did a few one-arm incline pushups with legs apart at first, then together. Legs together is so much fucking harder it's not even funny, even with such a steep incline. I can feel my feet slipping from underneath me. I'm trying so hard to not rotate my torso when coming back up, and I'm trying to avoid splaying my elbows. Left arm is having a hell of a time keeping up with the right. I transitioned to the ground for some slow and steady close pushups. I've stopped counting and recording reps like I used to, I just go until it hurts but before failure. \n&amp;#x200B;\nNext were leg raises. Started out on the ground with straight legs, and the next set I moved to the bar. Hanging leg raises are a lot harder for me because I feel more of a strain in my quads, and I tend to swing a little. I tried keeping my core flexed and tight the whole time to avoid swinging, but at this point I feel like I can get my muscles burning more on my back because my stamina is so much less while hanging. \n&amp;#x200B;\nFinally, grip training. Started with some clenched eagle claws, then 2 sets of 5 fingertip pushups to work the tops of the fingers. I did a few hangs from the bar to warm up, and then started some towel hangs. Jesus, is my endurance lower with the towel, and it's not even a thick one. But if I can get up to 30 seconds with the towel I'll be pretty happy with that, as I can do about a minute on the bar. \n&amp;#x200B;\nThat was it for the day. I went in, made my 1 giant meal for the day, started my fasting timer, and I'll try to hop on the stationary bike later tonight. Just thought I'd share this momentous day of getting off my ass and doing the right thing for a change. I'll keep going this whole week and stop being a lazy fuck. Thank you to this sub for keeping me mostly motivated throughout these many months. Cheers.\n5sav1age9: A week off can actually be really good for you and just what you need. Every 2-3 months I\u2019ll take about 5 or so days off just to give myself a chance to recover mentally and physically and I always come back feeling stronger than I ever have\nColdBoreShooter: Amen\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Slovakia\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The merging occurs with rates that depend on the lengths of the merging intervals, as well as on the current distribution of the process. The process is also subject to an external driving force, which can be thought of as a constant external field that tends to favor the growth of certain intervals over others.\nThe HCP can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known Edwards-Wilkinson model, which is a stochastic model that describes the coarsening dynamics of a one-dimensional interface. In the Edwards-Wilkinson model, the interface is described by a random function that evolves according to a Langevin equation, with a noise term that represents the random fluctuations in the interface. The HCP can be seen as a more general model that includes the Edwards-Wilkinson model as a special case, and that allows for a more complex and realistic description of the coarsening dynamics.\nOne of the main advantages of the HCP is that it allows for a more detailed and realistic description of the coarsening dynamics, by taking into account the effects of the external driving force and the finite set of allowed interval lengths. This can lead to a more accurate prediction of the final state of the system, and a better understanding of the underlying physics of the coarsening process.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"f\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Inactive intervals cannot incorporate their neighbors and can increase their length only if they are incorporated by active neighbors. The activity ranges are such that after a merging step the newly produced interval always becomes inactive for that epoch but active for some future epoch. Without making any mean-field assumption we show that: (i) if the initial distribution describes a renewal process, then such a property is preserved at all later times and all future epochs; (ii) the distribution of certain rescaled variables, for example, the domain length, has a well-defined and universal limiting behavior as $n\\to \\infty$ independent of the details of the process (merging rates, activity ranges$,...$). This last result explains the universality in the limiting behavior of several very different physical systems (e.g., the East model of glassy dynamics or the Paste-all model) which was observed in several simulations and analyzed in many physics papers. The main idea to obtain the asymptotic result is to first write down a recursive set of nonlinear identities for the Laplace transforms of the relevant quantities on different epochs and then to solve it by means of a transformation which in some sense linearizes the system.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Armenia\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Based on this law, all assets and liabilities of the existing public and cooperative insurance companies, mutual insurance funds, insurance departments of banks etc. are transferred to the State Insurance Institute (DZI). All valid insurances and portfolios, debts, as well as reinsurance contracts preserved their validity and were transferred by rights to DZI. By this act, effectively, DZI merged the active insurance companies into a bigger\n\nText continuation:\nentity, streamlining the insurance industry and consolidating its operations under state control.\nAs a result, DZI became the sole insurance provider in Bulgaria, responsible for managing and administering all types of insurance policies, including life insurance, non-life insurance, and reinsurance. The company's primary objective was to ensure the financial stability and security of the insurance market, as well as to provide a comprehensive range of insurance products to the Bulgarian population.\nOver the years, DZI has continued to grow and expand its operations, adapting to changing market conditions and regulatory requirements. In 1950, the company established its first foreign subsidiary in Romania, marking the beginning of its international expansion. This was followed by the establishment of additional subsidiaries and partnerships in other European countries, including the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, DZI focused on developing its life insurance business, introducing new products and services that catered to the growing demand for life insurance coverage in Bulgaria. The company also invested heavily in its infrastructure, building new offices and facilities to support its expanding operations.\nIn the 1980s, DZI faced significant challenges, including the impact of economic sanctions and the decline of the Soviet Union. However, the company continued to adapt and innovate, introducing new insurance products and services that catered to the changing needs of the Bulgarian population.\nIn the 1990s, Bulgaria began to transition towards a market-based economy, and DZI underwent significant reforms to prepare for the new market conditions. The company was restructured, and its operations were privatized, paving the way for its transformation into a private insurance company.\nToday, DZI is one of the largest and most respected insurance companies in Bulgaria, offering a wide range of insurance products and services to individuals, businesses, and institutions. The company continues to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions, investing in new technologies and services to stay ahead of the competition. With a rich history and a strong commitment to customer service, DZI remains a trusted and reliable partner for the Bulgarian insurance market.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"o\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Based on this law, all assets and liabilities of the existing public and cooperative insurance companies, mutual insurance funds, insurance departments of banks etc. are transferred to the State Insurance Institute (DZI). All valid insurances and portfolios, debts, as well as reinsurance contracts preserved their validity and were transferred by rights to DZI. By this act, effectively, DZI merged the active insurance companies into a bigger\n\nText continuation:\none. The state insurance control also ended its activity because the functions of the insurance control were transferred to DZI too.\nDZI was created by this law as an autonomous company, juridical entity, with headquarters in Sofia and with a complex structure, functioning in this way until 1952 when the establishment of branches and gradual decentralisation of the Institutes activity began.\nDZI functioned as the only insurance company in Bulgaria until 1961 when a government decree established the Bulgarian foreign insurance and reinsurance company \u201cBulstrad,\u201d founded on the then existing department within the DZI. The main shareholder in \u201cBulstrad\u201d was the Finance Ministry and one of the principal shareholders was DZI itself. \u201cBulstrad\u201d  dealt with all insurance contracts related to obligations outside of the territory of the country \u2013 marine, aviation, tourist etc., while DZI kept its monopoly over insurance business inside the country.\nApart the monopoly on insurance, after 1946 the State gradually raised the relative share of compulsory (by law) insurance. The Law for Property insurance was voted in 1958 and the modifications of 1969 enlarged considerably the range of compulsory property insurance.\nThe juridical monopoly on insurance has been kept strictly until 1989, when started real competition in insurance. Should be noticed, that although some of the names coincided, the newly created insurance companies were by no means successors of those existing before 1946.\nThe rise of the new situation in the business was a challenge for DZI, which successfully transformed itself to market conditions and kept its pre-eminent position thanks to excellent performance and the offering of insurance products of the highest standard. Together with its business development, the Company has collaborated actively for the establishment of an appropriate insurance legislation and was among the co-founders of the Bulgarian insurers association in 1992.\nIn October 1998 DZI was transformed into a public company with 100% state ownership. On 7 December 1999 in the \u201cState Gazette\u201d, issue 107 was published the decision of the Privatisation Agency to open a procedure for privatisation of the \u201cState Insurance Institute \u2013 DZI\u201d Plc. which ended with the sale of the company on 27 August 2002 to Emil Kyulev\u2019s \u201cContract Sofia\u201d Ltd.\nOn 10 October 2002 at the shareholders\u2019 General Meeting was taken the decision to rename the \u201cState Insurance Institute \u2013 DZI\u201d Plc. to \u201cDZI\u201d Plc.\nOn 21 December 2006, Eurobank EFG acquired over 90% of DZI's banking division, which was merged into Postbank in the third quarter of 2007.\nOn 3 August 2007 KBC received all needed approval\u2019s documents from regulations authorities and successfully finalised the acquisition of DZI with total amount of the acquired shares reaching 80,457%. \nDZI is headquartered in a six-storey landmark building in the centre of Sofia built 1914-1926 by architect G.

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease\n\nText continuation:\ntypically display characteristic features such as ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and interstitial patterns, which are difficult to distinguish from other lung diseases. To address this challenge, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the images as either COVID-19 positive or negative. Our model is trained using a combination of transfer learning and fine-tuning, allowing it to learn from the pre-trained weights and adapt to the specific characteristics of the COVID-19 dataset. We evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and compare it to other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our model achieves a high level of accuracy and robustness, outperforming other methods in detecting COVID-19 patients from chest radiography images. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models in aiding the diagnosis of COVID-19, and highlights the importance of developing accurate and reliable diagnostic tools to combat this global health crisis.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"r\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease\n\nText continuation:\npresence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% ($\\pm$ 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates.

This workshop bring together researchers applying compositional approaches to physics, NLP, cognitive science, and game theory. Within NLP, a long-standing aim is to represent how words can combine to form phrases and sentences. Within the framework of distributional semantics, words are represented as vectors in vector spaces. The categorical model of Coecke et al. [2010], inspired by quantum protocols, has provided a convincing account of compositionality in vector space models of NLP. There is furthermore a history of vector space models in cognitive science. Theories of categorization such as those developed by Nosofsky [1986] and Smith et al. [1988\n\nText continuation:\n] have also explored the idea of combining simple elements to form more complex concepts.\nIn the context of cognitive science, the study of compositionality has been driven by the need to understand how humans categorize and reason about complex concepts. For example, the theory of prototype-based categorization, developed by Rosch [1978], posits that categories are represented as clusters of features in a high-dimensional space, and that the similarity between two categories is determined by the similarity between their prototypes. This theory has been influential in the development of connectionist models of categorization, which have been used to simulate the human ability to recognize and generalize to new instances of a category.\nThe workshop will explore the connections between compositional approaches in NLP and cognitive science, and will discuss the potential for cross-fertilization between these fields. For example, the categorical model of Coecke et al. [2010] has been applied to a wide range of NLP tasks, including natural language inference, question answering, and machine translation. Similarly, the prototype-based theory of categorization has been used to model human categorization and reasoning in a variety of domains, including object recognition, event perception, and social cognition.\nIn addition to these theoretical connections, the workshop will also explore the practical applications of compositional approaches in NLP and cognitive science. For example, the development of compositional models of language understanding has the potential to improve the performance of natural language processing systems, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. Similarly, the study of compositionality in cognitive science has the potential to inform the development of more effective and efficient learning algorithms, as well as more accurate and robust models of human behavior.\nOverall, the workshop aims to bring together researchers from a range of disciplines to explore the connections between compositional approaches in NLP, cognitive science, and game theory. By fostering a deeper understanding of the theoretical and practical connections between these fields, the workshop hopes to inspire new research directions and applications that will advance our understanding of human language and cognition.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"g\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

More recently G\\\"ardenfors [2004, 2014] has developed a model of concepts in which conceptual spaces provide geometric structures, and information is represented by points, vectors and regions in vector spaces. The same compositional approach has been applied to this formalism, giving conceptual spaces theory a richer model of compositionality than previously [Bolt et al., 2018]. Compositional approaches have also been applied in the study of strategic games and Nash equilibria. In contrast to classical game theory, where games are studied monolithically as one global object, compositional game theory works bottom-up by building large and complex games from smaller components. Such an approach is inherently difficult since the interaction between games has to be considered. Research into categorical compositional methods for this field have recently begun [Ghani et al., 2018]. Moreover, the interaction between the three disciplines of cognitive science, linguistics and game theory is a fertile ground for research. Game theory in cognitive science is a well-established area [Camerer, 2011]. Similarly game theoretic approaches have been applied in linguistics [J\\\"ager, 2008]. Lastly, the study of linguistics and cognitive science is intimately intertwined [Smolensky and Legendre, 2006, Jackendoff, 2007]. Physics supplies compositional approaches via vector spaces and categorical quantum theory, allowing the interplay between the three disciplines to be examined.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Bahrain\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Perhaps we could explore other materials with better thermal conductivity or higher energy density?\ngredr: I understand what you're saying, but the article was flawed from the start. The idea of using concrete blocks as a means of energy storage is not only impractical but also inefficient. It's a solution looking for a problem.\nKarmaDarmaSchawarma: I see your point, but I think we should keep an open mind and consider alternative approaches. What if we could develop a system that combines different materials and technologies to achieve more efficient energy storage? For example, using advanced composites or nanomaterials to create a more compact and efficient energy storage device.\ngredr: I'm not opposed to exploring new ideas, but we need to be realistic about the challenges and limitations of energy storage. We can't just throw money at every new idea that comes along. We need to focus on developing technologies that are scalable, reliable, and cost-effective.\nKarmaDarmaSchawarma: I agree that we need to be practical and focus on solutions that can be implemented on a large scale. But I also think that we should continue to invest in research and development to push the boundaries of what is possible. Who knows what innovative solutions might emerge from these efforts?\ngredr: I suppose you're right. It's a delicate balance between being practical and being innovative.

And that means investing in renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, and innovative energy storage solutions.\ngredr: Agreed. And let's not forget about the role that policy and regulation can play in driving this transition.

A proper discussion was had when that article was first posted.\nKarmaDarmaSchawarma: While I agree that concrete itself is\n\nText continuation:\nactually pretty terrible for the environment, there's a plethora of materials that can be used in this application. The idea of storing energy via gravity has been around for a very long time and the science is solid. Sea water, for example, would work perfectly fine.\nDannyBlind: We call that \"hydro\" it has been done for a while already. Problem is, not everywhere is it feasible. If you want enough gravitational mass to bridge from night to day, for example solar, you need a whole bunch of mass. Next problem is if you'd only need a little bit of power. Water works great, concrete, not so much\nKayakingtheredriver: Seems to me we have a ton of old coal mines that just need a reservoir built upstream of them. Put generators all throughout the main mine shaft, and use the rest of the mine as the downward reservoir. Pump water out during the day, when you want to store energy, let the water turn the generators in the night when you want to add that energy to the grid as it fills the mine back up. Hundreds if not thousands of mine shafts all over under ground to conveniently *hide* half of the process and take up far less room, and room is always far more a problem than cost or ability.\nNewSauerKraus: The water has to go somewhere after it drops.\nKayakingtheredriver: https://www.adv-geosci.net/45/45/2018/adgeo-45-45-2018-avatar-web.png\nThat is what all the tunnels in the mine are for. The shaft is the drop to turn the turbines, the miles of tunnels at the bottom of the shaft are the storage. A mine is far, far more than the shaft. Run pipes down the shaft to the end of the mine tunnels with topside pumps to bring the water back up.\nNewSauerKraus: So your solution is to pump water up while energy is cheap, and let it flow down at night?\nKayakingtheredriver: Yep, or just *use* on site wind or solar stations to run the pumps during the day converting it into energy that is more valuable when there isn't sun and less wind at night. It is efficient, and renewable and the costs to maintain/build are far lessened because old mines have done most of the excavation for you and can be had dirt cheap, compared to building a dam and 2 reservoirs.\nNewSauerKraus: It\u2019s much cheaper, easier, and cleaner to just use a damn instead of a mine.\nKayakingtheredriver: Lol, dams are *so* easy and cheap to build huh? I will concede this water would become caustic with all the mixed in coal dust over time, but cost and and ease of build (from all the environment impact studies, what effect it will have on the river, displacement, and on and on) are far in the mine shafts favor. The mine only needs a above ground reservoir. It doesn't need an upstream or down stream river, a downstream reservoir, or displacement of land owners up/down stream or the years necessary to build all of that plus the dam. Just an upstream tank, the piped turbines (that you have to build either way) and the pump station (that you would have to build either way). None of the rest. It would cost way less in time and money.\nDannyBlind: I disagree, check my other comment.

The PHP is a passive, wickless thermal device, whereby a two-phase fluid, forming liquid plugs and vapour slugs, moves with a pulsating or circulating motion inside a meandering tube or channel. The PHP may have a very broad range of geometries (flat, tubular, 3D structured), it can dissipate heat from large areas, and it can be suitable for high power applications with low/medium heat fluxes. PHP functioning is based on the capillary\n\nText continuation:\nforces acting between the fluid and the tube walls, which drive the fluid circulation and heat transfer. The PHP is a promising technology for various space and terrestrial applications, such as thermal management in electronic systems, cooling of high-power devices, and heat recovery in industrial processes.\nThe experimental setup on the ISS consisted of a PHP module, which was connected to a thermal interface and a temperature control unit. The PHP module was filled with a mixture of water and glycerin, which is a commonly used working fluid for PHPs due to its high boiling point and low viscosity. The experiment was designed to investigate the performance of the PHP under various operating conditions, including different heat loads, fluid flow rates, and tube geometries. The experimental data was collected using a combination of sensors and cameras, which provided information on the fluid flow, temperature, and pressure inside the PHP.\nThe numerical code used to simulate the PHP experiment was developed using a commercial software package, which was modified to include the specific features of the PHP device. The code was validated by comparing the simulation results with the experimental data, and it was found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The code was then used to investigate the performance of the PHP under various operating conditions, including different heat loads, fluid flow rates, and tube geometries. The results of the simulation showed that the PHP was able to dissipate heat efficiently, even under high power conditions, and that the device was able to maintain a stable operating temperature.\nThe experimental results and simulation results were used to validate the numerical code and to investigate the performance of the PHP under various operating conditions. The results showed that the PHP was able to dissipate heat efficiently, even under high power conditions, and that the device was able to maintain a stable operating temperature. The results also showed that the PHP was able to operate in a wide range of temperatures, from -20\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C, and that the device was able to dissipate heat from large areas.\nIn conclusion, the experimental results and simulation results obtained during the PHP experiment on the ISS demonstrate the potential of Pulsating Heat Pipes for various space and terrestrial applications. The results show that the PHP is a promising technology for thermal management in electronic systems, cooling of high-power devices, and heat recovery in industrial processes. Further research is needed to fully understand the behavior of the PHP and to optimize its performance under various operating conditions.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"o\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

PHP functioning is based on the capillary\n\nText continuation:\neffect, which provides the existence of liquid plugs completely filling the channel cross-section, in a way that any expansion or contraction of the vapour slugs will naturally generate a movement of the fluid along the channel axis. For this, it is important that the channel has a cross-section size below a given threshold, which depends on the liquid surface tension and (for a static fluid) on the gravity acceleration. In space, when only residual accelerations are acting, such a static size threshold is virtually infinite, while a finite dynamic threshold exists even in the absence of gravity. The concept of a ''Space PHP'' was originally developed in 2014 by the team, and from then 17 Parabolic Flight Campaigns (PFC) and 3 Sounding Rocket (SR) experiments have been carried out to generate the data for the preparation of an experiment targeting a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) mission. Both a tubular and a flat plate PHP have been successfully tested in reduced gravity and on ground, by using different combinations of fluids and building materials. The need for having an experiment on a LEO environment is mainly because, during a PFC, only 22sec of reduced gravity are possible, which is a period below the characteristic time for reaching a steady state condition for almost all of the tested devices. Instead, a steady state was reached using the SR campaigns: in this case however, only one experimental condition was achievable, and long-duration data of the PHP performance still remains beyond reach. Several measurement methodologies have been used to characterise the Space PHP, like infrared analysis, high-speed camera visualisation techniques, with data processed with different techniques, from wavelets to inverse heat transfer problem solution. The results clearly showed that PHPs are very interesting for space applications due to their simplicity of construction, the capacity to transfer heat up to several hundred watts, a high power/weight ratio, their geometrical adaptability, and, in particular, the Space PHP will be a breakthrough technology for space thermal management.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Mauritania\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Ronaldinho is expected to leave Barcelona this summer after struggling for form last season. Laporta told the Catalan TV3 station that the Brazilian midfielder, who struggled with injuries and poor form last season, needed new challenges in his career. \"When the wheel turns, it's normal that the key figures leave,\" Laporta said. \"I would like Ronaldinho to be given a great send-off so that he is remembered for all he has given us and that if he didn't do any more it was because the circumstances wouldn't allow it. \"Last year, we thought that it might be the year to sell him, but given his enthusiasm and the appreciation that a club like Barcelona needs to have, we decided to let him stay on. Things haven't turned out the way he wanted them to.\" Laporta recognized that it might not be easy to sell Ronaldinho, who suffered a series of injury and fitness problems this season and made the starting line-up in only 13 of 38 league matches. Ronaldinho last played for Barcelona in the 2-1 loss at home to Villarreal on March 9, has suffered muscle pain in his right leg been out of action ever since. AC Milan showed an interest in signing him and his brother Robert De Assis said personal terms had been agreed. But the clubs failed to reach agreement over a transfer fee. After a second successive season without a trophy Barcelona announced on May 7 that Rijkaard would leave at the end of the season and be replaced by former player Josep Guardiola. \"We decided that if Frank did not continue then we would choose Guardiola because Pep possessed the necessary humility,\" said Laporta. \"We didn't think about coaches like Mourinho or (Rafa) Benitez, who are both great coaches, but aren't right for Barcelona. So we told Rijkaard that when he left Guardiola would take his place.\" Barca's arch-rivals Real Madrid, who lifted another Spanish title this season, have signed their first newcomer for the next campaign by paying a reported 10 million euros ($15.5 million) for Argentine defender Ezequiel Garay from Racing Santander.

Ronaldinho is expected to leave Barcelona this summer after struggling for form last season. Laporta told the Catalan TV3 station that the Brazilian midfielder, who struggled with injuries and poor form last season, needed new challenges in his career. \"When the wheel turns, it's normal that the key figures leave,\" Laporta said. \"I would like Ronaldinho to be given a great send-off so that he is remembered for all he has given us and that if he didn't do any more it was because the circumstances wouldn't allow it. \"Last year, we thought that it might be the year to sell him, but given his enthusiasm and the appreciation that a club like Barcelona needs to have, we decided to let him stay on. Things haven't turned out the way he wanted them to.\" Laporta recognized that it might not be easy to sell Ronaldinho, who suffered a series of injury and fitness problems this season and made the starting line-up in only 13 of 38 league matches. Ronaldinho last played for Barcelona in the 2-1 loss at home to Villarreal on March 9, has suffered muscle pain in his right leg been out of action ever since. AC Milan showed an interest in signing him and his brother Robert De Assis said personal terms had been agreed. But the clubs failed to reach agreement over a transfer fee. After a second successive season without a trophy Barcelona announced on May 7 that Rijkaard would leave at the end of the season and be replaced by former player Josep Guardiola. \"We decided that if Frank did not continue then we would choose Guardiola because Pep possessed the necessary humility,\" said Laporta. \"We didn't think about coaches like Mourinho or (Rafa) Benitez, who are both great coaches, but aren't right for Barcelona. So we told Rijkaard that when he left Guardiola would take his place.\" Barca's arch-rivals Real Madrid, who lifted another Spanish title this season, have signed their first newcomer for the next campaign by paying a reported 10 million euros ($15.5 million) for Argentine defender Ezequiel Garay from Racing Santander. Marca newspaper said the 21-year-old Argentine had signed a six-year contract. Meanwhile, reports that Real could be making a move for Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo were dismissed by coach Bernd Schuster. \"I prefer to spend my time talking about things that have some bearing to reality,\" he told a press conference.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary contains the letter \"g\".\n\nArticle:\nThe Needle is a fictional character, a mutant supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Mark Gruenwald, Carmine Infantino, and Al Gordon, the character first appeared in Spider-Woman #9 (December 1978). Creator Mark Gruenwald brought the character back during his run on the West Coast Avengers as a member of the villain team Night Shift, which included other former Spider-Woman foes.\nAfter being mugged one night while leaving work, Josef Saint, an elderly tailor, lost an eye and his ability to speak. While recuperating, he discovered that he has the power to paralyze with his gaze. Seeking revenge, Saint assumed the guise of the vigilante the Needle. Armed with a yard-long needle, the mute villain attacked young men on the streets at night, sewing their mouths shut. After victimizing S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jerry Hunt, the Needle incurred the wrath of Spider-Woman, the agent's girlfriend, and she took him out with a close-range venom blast. He was subsequently arrested.\nWith other superhuman adventurers and criminals, the Needle was imprisoned by the Locksmith, but then freed by Spider-Woman.\nThe Needle joined the Night Shift, and teamed with Captain America against the Power Broker and his augmented mutates. Alongside the Night Shift, he tested Moon Knight to take over as the leader of the Night Shift. Later, alongside the Night Shift, he battled the West Coast Avengers. Alongside the Night Shift, the second Hangman, and Satannish, he battled the Avengers West Coast; his abilities had been enhanced by Satannish's black magic.\nThe Needle was later defeated by Armory.\nNeedle appears with the Night Shift, as part of the Hood's gang. They battle the Midnight Sons, and Needle impales Daimon Hellstrom with his needle, before Jennifer Kale knocks him off with a spell. He and the Night Shift are killed when the zombie virus mutates and becomes airborne. The virus cloud begins to rain blood, and reanimates the Night Shift as zombies. Dormammu assumes control of the Night Shift and uses them to fight the Midnight Sons. When Jennifer Kale and the Black Talon contain the virus within the Zombie (Simon Garth), the Night Shift members are apparently restored to normal, and the Hood teleports away with them.\n\nSummary:\nThe Needle is a mutant supervillain created by Mark Gruenwald, Carmine Infantino, and Al Gordon.

Created by Mark Gruenwald, Carmine Infantino, and Al Gordon, the character first appeared in Spider-Woman #9 (December 1978). Creator Mark Gruenwald brought the character back during his run on the West Coast Avengers as a member of the villain team Night Shift, which included other former Spider-Woman foes.\nAfter being mugged one night while leaving work, Josef Saint, an elderly tailor, lost an eye and his ability to speak. While recuperating, he discovered that he has the power to paralyze with his gaze. Seeking revenge, Saint assumed the guise of the vigilante the Needle. Armed with a yard-long needle, the mute villain attacked young men on the streets at night, sewing their mouths shut. After victimizing S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jerry Hunt, the Needle incurred the wrath of Spider-Woman, the agent's girlfriend, and she took him out with a close-range venom blast. He was subsequently arrested.\nWith other superhuman adventurers and criminals, the Needle was imprisoned by the Locksmith, but then freed by Spider-Woman.\nThe Needle joined the Night Shift, and teamed with Captain America against the Power Broker and his augmented mutates. Alongside the Night Shift, he tested Moon Knight to take over as the leader of the Night Shift. Later, alongside the Night Shift, he battled the West Coast Avengers. Alongside the Night Shift, the second Hangman, and Satannish, he battled the Avengers West Coast; his abilities had been enhanced by Satannish's black magic.\nThe Needle was later defeated by Armory.\nNeedle appears with the Night Shift, as part of the Hood's gang. They battle the Midnight Sons, and Needle impales Daimon Hellstrom with his needle, before Jennifer Kale knocks him off with a spell. He and the Night Shift are killed when the zombie virus mutates and becomes airborne. The virus cloud begins to rain blood, and reanimates the Night Shift as zombies. Dormammu assumes control of the Night Shift and uses them to fight the Midnight Sons. When Jennifer Kale and the Black Talon contain the virus within the Zombie (Simon Garth), the Night Shift members are apparently restored to normal, and the Hood teleports away with them.\n\nSummary:\nThe Needle is a mutant supervillain created by Mark Gruenwald, Carmine Infantino, and Al Gordon.

At this distance the galaxy census is complete to Mi=-17.5 mag, i.e. approx 4 mag fainter than M*. The morphological classification of galaxies into early- (ellipticals) and late-types (spirals) was carried out by inspection of individual SDSS images and spectra. The density around each galaxies was determined in cylinders of 1 Mpc radius and 1000 km s^-1 half length\n\nText continuation:\n.\nBy analyzing the 3-D distribution of galaxies, we found that the environment plays a crucial role in shaping the evolution of galaxies. The galaxies in the Coma supercluster are distributed in a complex network of filaments and voids, with the rich clusters Coma and A1367 being the densest regions. The galaxies in these clusters are predominantly early-types, with a higher concentration of ellipticals in the central regions and a mix of ellipticals and spirals in the outskirts. In contrast, the galaxies in the groups and filaments are mostly late-types, with a higher proportion of spirals and irregulars.\nThe density around each galaxy was found to be a strong function of its distance from the nearest cluster or group center. Galaxies in the central regions of clusters and groups have higher densities than those in the outskirts, and the density decreases rapidly with distance from the cluster or group center. This suggests that the environment plays a key role in regulating the formation and evolution of galaxies, with the density of the surrounding medium influencing the growth and morphology of galaxies.\nFurthermore, we found that the galaxy population in the Coma supercluster is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, with a mix of different morphological types and luminosities. The galaxies in the Coma supercluster are also found to be part of a larger network of galaxy distributions, with many galaxies showing signs of interactions and mergers. The study of these interactions and mergers can provide valuable insights into the role of the environment in shaping the evolution of galaxies.\nOverall, our analysis of the 3-D distribution of galaxies in the Coma supercluster provides new insights into the role of the environment in shaping the evolution of galaxies. The study of the galaxy distribution in this region can provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies, and the role of the environment in regulating the growth and morphology of galaxies.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"m\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The density around each galaxies was determined in cylinders of 1 Mpc radius and 1000 km s^-1 half length\n\nText continuation:\n. The color-luminosity relation was derived for galaxies in bins morphological type and in four thresholds of galaxy density-contrast, ranging from delta{1,1000} <= 0 (UL = the cosmic web); 0 < delta{1,1000} <= 4 (L = the loose groups); 4 < delta{1,1000} <= 20 (H = the large groups and the cluster's outskirts) and delta{1,1000} > 20 (UH = the cluster's cores). The fraction of early-type galaxies increases with the log of the over-density. A well defined \"red sequence\" composed of early-type galaxies exists in all environments at high luminosity, but it lacks of low luminosity (dwarf) galaxies in the lowest density environment. Conversely low luminosity isolated galaxies are predominantly of late-type. In other words the low luminosity end of the distribution is dominated by red dE galaxies in clusters and groups and by dwarf blue amorphous systems in the lowest density regions. At z=0 we find evidence for strong evolution induced by the environment (Nurture). Transformations take place mostly at low luminosity when star forming dwarf galaxies inhabiting low density environments migrate into amorphous passive dwarf ellipticals in their infall into denser regions. The mechanism involves suppression of the star formation due to gas stripping, without significant mass growth, as proposed by Boselli et al. (2008a). This process is more efficient and fast in ambients of increasing density. In the highest density environments (around clusters) the truncation of the star formation happens fast enough (few 100 Myr) to produce the signature of post-star-burst in galaxy spectra. PSB galaxies, that are in fact found significantly clustered around the largest dynamical units, represent the remnants of star forming isolated galaxies that had their star formation violently suppressed during their infall in clusters in the last 0.5-1.5 Gyrs, and the progenitors of future dEs.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Kyrgyzstan\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The King of England in the late 1050s and early 1060s was Edward the Confessor. Edward was William's cousin. Since Edward was childless, there were multiple people who claimed that they were the rightful heir and should become king. These conflicting claims gave rise to armed conflict. William invaded England, where he won the Battle of Hastings, defeating earl Harold Godwinson. A number of battles followed, but William became King of England late in 1066. He dealt with multiple rebellions over the next decade, but retained his power.

The main focus lies on the instrumental genesis process (Rabardel 1995; Longchamp 2012)-a concept trying to express and analyze the co-evolution of instruments and the practices they make possible-underlying this development. It is described through the collaboration and communication processes between computer science scholars and humanities scholars in finding new ways of visualizing complex datasets for exploration and presentation in the realm of film-studies research. It draws on\n\nText continuation:\nthe concept of instrumental genesis to understand how the visualization framework emerged as a tool that enables researchers to analyze and explore the temporal dynamics of audiovisual expressivity.\nThe collaboration between computer science and humanities scholars was a crucial aspect of the instrumental genesis process. Through regular meetings and workshops, the researchers were able to share their expertise and perspectives, leading to a deeper understanding of the research question and the development of a visualization framework that was tailored to the needs of film-studies researchers. The computer science scholars brought their expertise in data visualization and machine learning, while the humanities scholars brought their knowledge of film studies and the temporal dynamics of audiovisual expressivity.\nThe visualization framework developed through this collaboration enables researchers to analyze and explore the temporal dynamics of audiovisual expressivity in a more nuanced and detailed way. It allows them to visualize the complex relationships between different elements of the audiovisual expressivity, such as the relationship between sound and image, and to identify patterns and trends that may not be immediately apparent through traditional methods of analysis. The framework also enables researchers to explore the temporal dynamics of audiovisual expressivity in a more flexible and interactive way, allowing them to manipulate the data and visualize different aspects of the audiovisual expressivity in real-time.\nThe instrumental genesis process was also influenced by the researchers' understanding of the research question and the goals of the project. The researchers recognized that the visualization framework needed to be flexible and adaptable, as the needs of film-studies researchers can vary widely depending on the specific research question and the type of data being analyzed. They also recognized the importance of ensuring that the visualization framework was easy to use and accessible to researchers who may not have a background in computer science or data visualization.\nIn conclusion, the instrumental genesis process was a crucial aspect of the development of the visualization framework for the analysis of the temporal dynamics of audiovisual expressivity. The collaboration between computer science and humanities scholars enabled the researchers to share their expertise and perspectives, leading to a deeper understanding of the research question and the development of a visualization framework that was tailored to the needs of film-studies researchers. The framework enables researchers to analyze and explore the temporal dynamics of audiovisual expressivity in a more nuanced and detailed way, and has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of film studies.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"t\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The main focus lies on the instrumental genesis process (Rabardel 1995; Longchamp 2012)-a concept trying to express and analyze the co-evolution of instruments and the practices they make possible-underlying this development. It is described through the collaboration and communication processes between computer science scholars and humanities scholars in finding new ways of visualizing complex datasets for exploration and presentation in the realm of film-studies research. It draws on\n\nText continuation:\nthe outcome and concrete usage of the visualizations in publications and presentations of a research group, the AdAproject, that investigates the audiovisual rhetorics of affect in audiovisual media on the financial crisis (2007-). These film analyses are based on theoretical assumptions on the process of film-viewing, the relation of the viewer's perception and the temporally unfolding audiovisual images, and a methodical approach that draws on 'steps' in the research process such as segmentation, description and qualification, called eMAEX (Kappelhoff et al. 2011-2016) to reconstruct these experiential figurations (Bakels et al. 2020a, 2020b). The main focus of this paper is the process of iterative development of visualizations as interactive interfaces generated with the open-source software Advene, that were an integral part of the research process. In this regard, the timeline visualization is not only of interest for visual argumentation in (digital) humanities publications, but also for the creation of annotations as well as the exploration of this data. In the first part of the paper we describe this interdisciplinary collaboration as instrumental genesis on a general level-as an evolving and iterative process. In the second part we focus on the specific challenge of designing a visualization framework for the temporal dynamics of audiovisual aesthetics. Lastly we zoom out by reflecting on experiences and insights that might be of interest for the wider digital humanities community.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Oman\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

He made his first senior appearance for Hibernian, during a temporary loan in March 1942. Niven was also loaned to Dundee before he broke into the East Fife first team. He was their regular first choice goalkeeper during their period of success after the Second World War.

He was a key player in the team that finished third in the Scottish First Division in the 1950-51 season. Niven's consistency and shot-stopping ability made him a fan favorite at Easter Road, and he remained a loyal servant to the club until his retirement in 1957.\nAfter hanging up his boots, Niven went on to manage several amateur teams, including his old club Renfrew, where he won the Scottish Amateur Cup in 1961. He also worked as a coach and goalkeeper coach for various clubs, including Hibernian, where he helped develop the skills of several young goalkeepers. Niven's legacy as one of Scotland's greatest goalkeepers was cemented in 2007, when he was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. Despite his passing in 2011, Niven's memory lives on through the countless fans who remember his incredible performances on the pitch and his dedication to the beautiful game.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"l\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The concept of community role of a node was derived from this base, in order to describe the position of a node in a network depending on its connectivity at the community level. However, the existing approaches are restricted to undirected networks, use topological measures which do not consider all aspects of community-related connectivity, and their role identification methods are not generalizable to all networks. We tackle these limitations by generalizing and extending the measures, and using an unsupervised approach to determine the roles. We then illustrate the\n\nText continuation:\neffectiveness of our approach by applying it to a set of real-world networks, including social networks, biological networks, and transportation networks. Our results show that our approach is able to identify a wide range of community roles, including connectors, hubs, and isolates, and that these roles are highly dependent on the specific network and its community structure.\nIn particular, we find that the community roles of nodes in social networks are highly correlated with their social status, with high-degree nodes acting as hubs and low-degree nodes acting as isolates. In biological networks, we find that community roles are related to the functional roles of the nodes, with hubs acting as central nodes in metabolic pathways and isolates acting as peripheral nodes. In transportation networks, we find that community roles are related to the connectivity of the nodes, with hubs acting as major transportation hubs and isolates acting as small towns.\nThese results demonstrate the potential of our approach for analyzing complex networks and identifying community roles. By using an unsupervised approach, we are able to identify community roles without requiring prior knowledge of the network or its community structure. This makes our approach highly flexible and applicable to a wide range of networks and domains.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"y\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Companies take advantage of the fact that women are often willing to pay more for products that are marketed as \"feminine\" or \"pink\". It's not just razors, it's everything from shampoo to makeup to clothing. And it's not just about the price, it's about the message it sends. It's saying that women are willing to pay more for things that are marketed to them, and that they're not worth the same as men.\nGurgaon_ka_bachha: Exactly! And it's not just about the price, it's about the societal implications. When companies price their products higher for women, it perpetuates the idea that women are somehow less valuable than men. It's a subtle form of sexism, but it's still sexism.\nRedPillSailor: I see what you're saying, but I still think price controls are a bad idea. It's better to let the market decide what prices are fair. If companies are charging too much for their products, then people will just choose not to buy them.\nWTF_HomeSlice: But that's not always an option for women, especially those who are low-income or living in poverty. They may not have the luxury of choosing not to buy something because it's too expensive. That's why I think the government should step in and make sure that these products are affordable for everyone.\nMy wife and I have talked about this a lot, and we've come to the realization that we need to be more mindful of the products we buy and the companies we support. We try to buy from companies that are transparent about their pricing and that don't engage in discriminatory pricing practices.\nGurgaon_ka_bachha: That's a great point! Consumers have the power to make a change by voting with their wallets. By supporting companies that are fair and transparent, we can send a message that we won't tolerate discriminatory pricing practices.\nRedPillSailor: I agree, but I still think that government intervention is not the best solution. It's better to let the market decide what prices are fair, and to educate consumers about the products they're buying.\nWTF_HomeSlice: But what about the women who don't have the education or the resources to make informed decisions about the products they're buying? They're the ones who are most affected by discriminatory pricing practices, and they're the ones who need the most help.\nGurgaon_ka_bachha: That's a great point. The government has a role to play in protecting the most vulnerable members of society, including low-income women. By regulating prices and ensuring that products are affordable, the government can help to level the playing field and promote fairness and equality.\nRedPillSailor: I see what you're saying, but I still think that government intervention is not the best solution.

We were poor and to save money, my wife bought a $20 hair clipper from Longs. She's cut my hair for the past 27 years. I think we're on our 4 hair clipper, so $80 for 27 years. Less than $3 a year is pretty affordable. The tips are a little different though.\nTheVastWaistband: Are you kidding?\nThere are many men only barbershops here set you up with a beer when you walk in. Then they do scalp massage, and do a traditional hot towel treatment and shave with straight razor. They also do nose hair, ear, and unibrow waxing and fingernail filing and buffing.\nAlso, you say you don't even go to barbershops and do at home buzzcuts....so you're proclaiming yourself uniquely uninformed in your opinion\nElectricRook1: Why should I waste my money on getting my ego massaged?\nTheVastWaistband: ....you know that taking the time to get a nice haircut and a.shave doesn't mean you're some kind of pussy or faggot right? Maybe you have some sort of insecurity in that area or some self loathing where you don't want to spend money on yourself. Regardless, this is a normal thing for most guys.\nElectricRook1: Yes, maybe I have a loathing to spend money on myself. I don't care what other people do with their money, how they want to spend it, or light it on fire for all I care.\nThe fight wakes up in me, when people start talking about how awful it is that they have to pay too much for hygiene products ... when they have brushed off all frugality to buy premium products, then call for price controls when they themselves are the root of poor value by selecting only premium products.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Finland\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The most simple example of this construction is the Brieskorn module (see [Br.70]) of a function with an isolated singular point. See [B.08] for the case of a 1-dimensional critical locus. But it is clear that this construction depends\n\nText continuation:\non the choice of a local coordinate near the critical point, and it would be interesting to study the invariance of this construction under changes of local coordinates.\nIn fact, it is known that the Brieskorn module is invariant under small deformations of the function, and it would be interesting to study the behavior of the (a,b)-modules under such deformations. Moreover, it is expected that the (a,b)-modules can be used to study the geometry of the critical locus, and it would be interesting to explore this connection further.\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that the construction of the (a,b)-modules can be generalized to the case of a function with a non-isolated critical locus. In this case, the (a,b)-modules would represent a filtered version of the Gauss-Manin connection of the function, and they would be expected to be invariant under small deformations of the function.\nIn addition, the (a,b)-modules can be used to study the properties of the function near the critical locus, such as the behavior of the function near the critical point, and the geometry of the critical locus. The study of these properties is an active area of research, and the (a,b)-modules are expected to play an important role in this area.\nIt is also worth noting that the construction of the (a,b)-modules can be generalized to the case of a function with a critical value at a point in the complex manifold, rather than just a point in the smooth complex curve. In this case, the (a,b)-modules would represent a filtered version of the Gauss-Manin connection of the function, and they would be expected to be invariant under small deformations of the function.\nIn conclusion, the construction of the (a,b)-modules is a powerful tool for studying the properties of holomorphic functions near their critical points, and it is expected to play an important role in the study of the geometry and topology of complex manifolds.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"d\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The aim of the present paper is to study the behaviour of such constructions when we make a change of local coordinate near the origin. We consider the case of \\ $[\\lambda]-$primitive frescos, which are monogenic geometric (a,b)-modules corresponding to a minimal filtered differential equation associated to a relative de Rham cohomology class on \\ $X$ \\ (see [B.09-a] and [B.09-b]). An holomorphic parameter is a function on the set of isomorphism classes of frescos which behave holomorphically in an holomorphic family of frescos. In general, an holomorphic parameter is not invariant by a change of variable, but we prove a theorem of stability of holomorphic families of frescos by a change of variable and it implies that an holomorphic parameter gives again an holomorphic parameter by a change of variable. We construct here two different kinds of holomorphic parameters which are (quasi-)invariant by change of variable. The first kind is associated to Jordan blocks of the monodromy with size at least two. The second kind is associated to the semi-simple part of the monodromy and look like some \"cross ratio\" of eigenvectors. They allow, in the situation describe above, to associate to a given (vanishing) relative de Rham cohomology class some numbers, which will depend holomorphically of our data, and are independant of the choice of the local coordinate near \\ $0$ \\ to study the Gauss-Manin connection of this degeneration of compact complex manifolds.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Kuwait\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

At the end of the day they should sit here, then they would understand.\n\"I'm not abusive, I'm polite, I'm only sat here, I'm not going out shoplifting or going and mugging people.\"\nBut Ms Dallimore said support is available for those who want to tackle their addictions.\nShe said: \"We have been working with not only the police but also with a lot of our charitable sector partners including Turning Point who help people with substance misuse issues.\n\"It's welcome news this individual wants help, and the public needs to report individuals they're coming across to us.\"\n\nSummary:\nA crackdown on begging is being taken in Gloucester after reports of rising anti-social behaviour.\n\nDoes the summary mention the country \"Zimbabwe\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

They smashed the wickets, swirled the ball, and won the hearts and minds of spectators all over the world.\n1. Shane Warne\n2. Anil Kumble\n3. Abdul Qadir\n4. Richie Benaud\n5. Mushtaq Ahmed\n\nSummary:\n1. Shane Warne\nSo, what can we say about the legend who single-handedly revolutionised the world of leg spin in cricket? We've all seen Warne's Ball of the Century, which left Mike Gatting puzzled as if he'd seen a ghost.\nWarne, one of the game's most charming athletes, is still recognised as one of the best match-winners of all time. He was unrivalled when it came to bowling with a leg spin.\n2. Anil Kumble\nAnil Kumble, India's best wicket-taker, has 619 wickets in 132 Test matches for an average of 29.65.\nThe superstar is recognised as one of the best and most decorated Indian cricketers in history. Kumble has the third-most wickets of all time, trailing only Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne.\nHe is also the second bowler, after Jim Laker, to ever take all ten wickets in an innings. He attained this record with a stunning 10/74 against Pakistan.\n3. Abdul Qadir\nAbdul Qadir revitalized the dying skill of leg spin in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He was a great genius with the ball. He'd ascend from a loping, bounce-filled run-up to the wicket and hurl the ball with considerable ostentation.\nQadir had many typical leg-spin presentations that changed the ball's trajectory and turn to enchant a wide range of combinations.\nHe bowled the top spinner and the flipper with tremendous precision and effect, and he had at least two different googlies. He frequently had too many options and employed too much diversity, rather than building a rhythm.\n4. Richie Benaud\nRichie Benaud was known as the \"Voice of Cricket.\" He came to personify the game in all of its guises, from batter to captain to writer to pundit to thinker!\nHe is considered one of cricket's all-time greats, second only to Sir Donald Bradman. Benaud is the only all-rounder on this list, as well as the only all-rounder who bowls spin.\n5. Mushtaq Ahmed\nMushtaq Ahmed is another Pakistani star who has made our list.\nHe modelled his persona after Intikhab Alam and Abdul Qadir. Mushtaq was an outstanding bowler with a fiery tenacity. During a brief but energetic run-up to the wicket, the ball was delivered with a misty whirling of arms.\nHe would implore the umpire for a favourable verdict with frenzied and wild appeals, and he would become visibly discouraged if the umpire ignored his straighter one or googly or allowed a batsman to escape despite intended padding.\n\nDoes the summary mention the country \"Tajikistan\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Juan Roman Riquelme celebrates after scoring his first goal in Argentina's win against Bolivia. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular free-kicks in the opening 2-0 victory against Chile to help put his country five points clear of second-placed Brazil, who play Peru in Lima on Sunday. Riquelme again shrugged off his lack of club action with Villarreal, where he has fallen out with the Spanish side's management, to net twice in the second spell after Sergio Aguero gave the home side a first-half lead. The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a three-man attack with Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi. He headed home after Martin Demichelis nodded a cross from Manchester United striker Tevez back across goal. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping free-kick which beat Carlos Arias from 25 yards, having been superbly denied by the keeper's one-handed effort shortly beforehand.

Juan Roman Riquelme celebrates after scoring his first goal in Argentina's win against Bolivia. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular free-kicks in the opening 2-0 victory against Chile to help put his country five points clear of second-placed Brazil, who play Peru in Lima on Sunday. Riquelme again shrugged off his lack of club action with Villarreal, where he has fallen out with the Spanish side's management, to net twice in the second spell after Sergio Aguero gave the home side a first-half lead. The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a three-man attack with Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi. He headed home after Martin Demichelis nodded a cross from Manchester United striker Tevez back across goal. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping free-kick which beat Carlos Arias from 25 yards, having been superbly denied by the keeper's one-handed effort shortly beforehand. And he finished off the scoring in the 73rd minute with a cool sidefoot finish after being set up by Messi to cap off a match in which captain Javier Zanetti made a record-breaking 116th appearance for Argentina. Argentina next travel to Colombia on Tuesday, when winless Bolivia have an away clash with Venezuela. In other South American qualifiers, Colombia beat Venezuela 1-0, and Paraguay routed Ecuador 5-1.

The rallies, which draw mostly teens, are one part concert, one part Christian revival. \"I had to stop listening to them for a while,\" said Hutchins, who lives in Cumming, Georgia, and plays the piano, guitar and harmonica. He said the group's world view \"had a negative effect on me,\" and made him irritable and angry. \"God owns my life, not the Beatles,\" he said simply. Although Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music -- from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United -- he said he has to be careful of what music he listens to, for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles. Hutchins, a 16-year-old graced with poise and thoughtfulness, is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture, with its ubiquitous references to sex, drugs and violence, has harmed him. Last year, Hutchins and his Christian youth group attended an Acquire the Fire rally in Atlanta, Georgia, he said. Acquire the Fire -- regional rallies held across the country -- and BattleCry -- the larger rallies held this year in only three cities -- are the products of the evangelical Christian organization Teen Mania.  Go behind-the-scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a BattleCry event \u00bb . One part concert, one part Christian revival, the rallies seek to \"stage a reverse revolution\" against secular popular culture. They have the pull of headlining rock concerts, drawing thousands of people regardless of the region of the country, the month of year or the day of the week. The audiences are nearly always predominantly teenagers and young adults. From 2006 to 2007, a total of 127,830 people attended the 34 Acquire the Fire rallies, and 71,414 people attended the three BattleCry events held in San Francisco, California; Detroit, Michigan; and Bristow, Virginia, according to Teen Mania. Watch flags, fireworks and teens at rally . For Hutchins, who said he struggled in his early adolescence to fit in and be cool before having a personal experience with God about four years ago, the organization's message is exactly right. \"We don't have to be branded by the culture, we are branded by God,\" he said. \"Be who God created you to be.\" But the glossy, glamorous appeal of popular culture too often obscures that path to God, Teen Mania followers say. And so, Ron Luce, the 46-year-old founder of the organization, has waged a modern-day crusade against \"purveyors of popular culture,\" whom he has condemned as \"the enemy.\" More than two decades old, Teen Mania estimates it has reached more than 2 million teens with its message \"of living completely for Christ.\" The organization is sprawling. In addition to its live stadium rallies, there are BattleCry shirts and hats, mobile screen savers, books and a television program. There are international mission trips -- Hutchins attended one in Tijuana, Mexico, this summer. There is even a Teen Mania internship, a one-year program called the Honor Academy, based in Lindale, Texas. In the live events, Luce couples the earnest appeal of a young father with a preacher's ability to mobilize a crowd. He weaves disturbing statistics about teenagers amid his gospel. Today's teenagers are in crisis, he says. \"We're fighting for those who don't know they have a voice, that are being manipulated by our pop culture indulging in things that, really, they're not mature enough to be thinking about yet,\" Luce told CNN. \"Kids are hurting,\" he said. And of those who he feels inflict these moral wounds, Luce said, \"We call them terrorists, virtue terrorists, that are destroying our kids.\" \"They're raping virgin teenage America on the sidewalk, and everybody's walking by and acting like everything's OK. And it's just not OK.\" To some, Luce's rhetoric is off-putting, hateful and divisive. Opponents point to his views on homosexuality -- not \"in God's plan\" -- and abortion -- the \"ending of a precious life\" -- and say Luce is imposing conservative values on vulnerable teenagers. Explore Americans' views on religion . It is this criticism that Luce and his followers confronted head-on in March at BattleCry San Francisco. There, in arguably the most liberal city in the United States, protesters, armed with megaphones and poster board signs, rallied against BattleCry on the steps of City Hall as the Christian teenagers circled and prayed in a demonstration of their own. \"Ron Luce is a liar!\" one protester shouted. \"Let me hear you say Christian fascist,\" another yelled. Luce and the youths, some as young as 11, also raised their voices. \"God, I ask that as we do this BattleCry, Lord, that you would reveal yourself to the teenagers, God, here, God,\" Mindy Peterson, shouted. Peterson is a member of Teen Mania's Honor Academy. Afterward, Peterson railed against what she said was the protesters' mischaracterization of BattleCry. \"These people think that our war is against other people. They think that our war is against man. And our war isn't. Our war's against ... the pain in teenagers' hearts, like depression, alcoholism. Those things that -- that are, like, tearing our teenagers apart,\" she said. While much milder in his terms, Hutchins agrees. \"We're a generation that is kind of troubled,\" he said. Luce wants to \"rescue the hearts of our generation,\" he added. And of the critics' contention that the rallies, the organization, the message is neo-conservatism wrapped in Biblical verse?

In the same way, the government and societal structures that perpetuate these beliefs about women are also responsible for creating an environment that is hostile towards them. We can't just focus on the individuals who carry out these actions, but also the systems and institutions that enable and perpetuate them.\nAs we continue to discuss this topic, it's essential to recognize that the issue of misogyny and oppression is deeply rooted in societal structures and power dynamics. It's not just about individual people, but about the systems and institutions that perpetuate these beliefs and actions.\nIn the case of Najmia, she is a victim of these societal structures, but she is also a symbol of resistance and defiance. Her decision to not wear her hijab despite being harassed is a powerful statement against the oppressive norms that seek to control her and other women. It's a reminder that women have the power to resist and challenge these norms, and that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.\nAs we move forward, it's crucial that we continue to have these conversations and challenge the societal structures that perpetuate misogyny and oppression. We need to recognize that these issues are complex and multifaceted, and that they require a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of these problems.\nUltimately, it's up to us to create a society that values and respects all individuals, regardless of their gender, race, religion, or any other characteristic. We need to work towards a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential, free from the constraints of oppressive societal structures.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"r\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "###"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I would say the children in Hitler youth were first generation victims. \nYou don't get to be a victim of the system when you installed it.\nWhat's more is a bully who was made a bully by the system is still a bully.  You can be a victim and also an asshole. You can be mad at Hitler and the environment that raised him. But Hitler had access to different viewpoints and picked the one he arrived at despite education. These kids don't have that luxury. When someone disagrees,  men with sticks show up and beat the hell out of them.\nSakuraba85: What do you mean? Hitler was shaped by his education and upbringing just like these men. \nHe grew up with being ashamed of how Germany acted and was treated after WW1 and was taught about that in school and his society.\nlightknight7777: The reason Hitler was evil wasn't him being mad at how Germany was treated.  It wasn't even him wanting to make Germany powerful again.  Conquerers have existed all throughout history without being known from then on as evil.  It was the \"genocide\" bit that made him the image of evil. Out of a plethora of perfectly viable options, he decided on concentration camps and murder. \nThere's a massive difference between being raised to think something bad is \"the truth\" vs specifically seeking out something bad to believe in from options. He arrived at his particular brand of insanity after significant research and adult social circles. You can be mad at him even having that path to come to. Heck, antisemitism was super common at the time (even in the US), but him going \"therefore let's remove them\" was  on him. Every other government was managing to not round them up and murder them.\nSakuraba85: Ok, i understand. It\u2019s not evil wanting to hang children because they don\u2019t want to have fabric on their heads. Got it. It\u2019s not their fault.\nlightknight7777: As I stated,  a bully who was made a bully by their system is still a bully. Them espousing the evil beliefs they were taught is still bad but they are also victims as well. \nWhat you don't seem to be accepting is my primary point that the system that produces evil is more evil than the individuals. At no point did I say they weren't espousing evil.

Conversely, we prove that holomorphic nondegeneracy is necessary for this property of CR mappings to hold. For the case of unequal dimensions, we also prove that if $M$ is an algebraic hypersurface in $ C^N$ which does not contain any complex variety of positive codimension and $M'$ is the sphere in $ C^{N+1 }$ , then extendability holds for all CR mappings with certain minimal a priori regularity. Theorem A. Let $M$ and $M'$ be two algebraic hypersurfaces in $C^N$ and assume that $M$ is connected and holomorphically\n\nText continuation:\nnondegenerate. Then any CR mapping $F$ from $M$ to $M'$ with Jacobian not identically zero can be extended to a holomorphic mapping from a neighborhood of $M$ to $M'$.\nWe will now provide a proof of this theorem. Let $F$ be a CR mapping from $M$ to $M'$ with Jacobian not identically zero. Since $M$ is connected and holomorphically nondegenerate, we can choose a point $p$ on $M$ such that the tangent space to $M$ at $p$ is not contained in any complex variety of positive codimension. Let $V$ be the complex variety of positive codimension in $C^N$ that contains the tangent space to $M$ at $p$. Then $V$ is a proper closed complex subvariety of $C^N$ that contains $M$.\nLet $U$ be a neighborhood of $M$ in $C^N$ such that $U$ does not intersect $V$ and $F$ is defined on $U$. Since $F$ is a CR mapping, we can write $F$ in the form $F(z)=\\left(f_1(z),\\ldots,f_N(z)\\right)$, where $f_1,\\ldots,f_N$ are real-valued functions on $U$ that satisfy the CR equations $\\overline{\\partial}f_j=0$ for $j=1,\\ldots,N$. Since $F$ is holomorphically nondegenerate, we can choose a point $q$ on $M$ such that the Jacobian matrix of $F$ at $q$ has rank $N$.\nLet $W$ be a neighborhood of $q$ in $U$ such that the Jacobian matrix of $F$ is invertible on $W$. Then $F$ is a diffeomorphism from $W$ to $F(W)$. Since $F(W)$ is a neighborhood of $F(q)$ in $M'$, we can choose a point $r$ on $M'$ such that $F(q)$ is in the connected component of $M'$ that contains $r$. Let $V'$ be the complex variety of positive codimension in $C^{N+1}$ that contains the tangent space to $M'$ at $r$. Then $V'$ is a proper closed complex subvariety of $C^{N+1}$ that contains $M'$.\nLet $U'$ be a neighborhood of $M'$ in $C^{N+1}$ such that $U'$ does not intersect $V'$ and $F$ is defined on $U'$. Since $F$ is a CR mapping, we can write $F$ in the form $F(z)=\\left(f_1(z),\\ldots,f_N(z),f_{N+1}(z)\\right)$, where $f_1,\\ldots,f_N,f_{N+1}$ are real-valued functions on $U'$ that satisfy the CR equations $\\overline{\\partial}f_j=0$ for $j=1,\\ldots,N+1$. Since $F$ is holomorphically nondegenerate, we can choose a point $s$ on $M'$ such that the Jacobian matrix of $F$ at $s$ has rank $N+1$.\nLet $W'$ be a neighborhood of $s$ in $U'$ such that the Jacobian matrix of $F$ is invertible on $W'$. Then $F$ is a diffeomorphism from $W'$ to $F(W')$. Since $F(W')$ is a neighborhood of $F(s)$ in $M'$, we can choose a point $t$ on $M'$ such that $F(s)$ is in the connected component of $M'$ that contains $t$. Let $V''$ be the complex variety of positive codimension in $C^{N+2}$ that contains the tangent space to $M''$ at $t$. Then $V''$ is a proper closed complex subvariety of $C^{N+2}$ that contains $M''$.\nLet $U''$ be a neighborhood of $M''$ in $C^{N+2}$ such that $U''$ does not intersect $V''$ and $F$ is defined on $U''$. Since $F$ is a CR mapping, we can write $F$ in the form $F(z)=\\left(f_1(z),\\ldots,f_N(z),f_{N+1}(z),f_{N+2}(z)\\right)$, where $f_1,\\ldots,f_N,f_{N+1},f_{N+2}$ are real-valued functions on $U''$ that satisfy the CR equations $\\overline{\\partial}f_j=0$ for $j=1,\\ldots,N+2$. Since $F$ is holomorphically nondegenerate, we can choose a point $u$ on $M''$ such that the Jacobian matrix of $F$ at $u$ has rank $N+2$.\nLet $W''$ be a neighborhood of $u$ in $U''$ such that the Jacobian matrix of $F$ is invertible on $W''$. Then $F$ is a diffeomorphism from $W''$ to $F(W'')$.

Let $p_0 \\in M$ and suppose there exists a germ at $p_0$ of a smooth CR function on $M$ which does not extend holomorphically to any full neighborhood of $p_0$ in $C^N$.

The properties are distinct, and I think that's what's giving us a bit of a reprieve\nBut I digress, back to silicone in the kitchen. I've been using it for everything from spatulas to storage containers, and it's been a game-changer. The non-stick surface is a dream for cooking and cleaning, and it's so easy to sterilize. I've even started using it for making homemade pasta, and it's been a revelation. The way it glides across the countertop, effortlessly shaping and cutting the dough... it's like magic.\nOf course, there are some downsides to silicone. For one, it can be a bit of a pain to clean when it's caked on with food residue. And some people have reported that it can impart a slightly chemical taste to certain foods. But overall, I think the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.\nAnd who knows, maybe in 50 years we'll look back on silicone the way we do on vinyl records or VHS tapes \u2013 a relic of a bygone era.

Your point being?\nPlastic is not really an engineering term, but what it means is literally \"a material made of polymers that are plastic.\" I.e. moldable. Which a rubber is.\nKILROYguy: I mean, no matter how much I google I can't seem to find a single source saying that it is a plastic. Plenty of sources say that it isn't tough. Would be happy if you could point me in the right direction!\nraznov1: As replied above as well, it depends:\nOne definition says \"the distinction between rubber and plastic is that one is natural and the other is synthetic\", by which \"synthetic rubber\" is thus an impossibility - silicone rubber is a contradiction and should be called silicone plastic.\nAnother definition says \"a plastic is a synthetic or semi-synthetic material that is made of polymers that are moldable, i.e. that are plastic.\" by which any polymer material that has undergone a form of chemical processing and is moldable is a plastic.\neither way, \"plastic\" nor \"rubber\" is a useful term, as they're too loose\nglytxh: Reading further myself, natural rubbers and plastic are both based on hybdrocarbon chains, with the former more often far more complex emulsions of these chains with water, proteins and other complex organics like sugars. \nThe definitions also change depending on the industrial or academic context. \nChemically, vaguely similar, but in practice very different material groups. There are a lot of overlaps in specific applications too so that just makes things even more vague. \nVulcanised Rubber is a good example, I think.\nraznov1: &gt;with the former more often far more complex emulsions of these chains with water, proteins and other complex organics like sugars.\nNot really - silicone \"rubber\" is really easy, for example.\n&gt;Chemically, vaguely similar, but in practice very different material groups.

The story portrays it like college was out of the question because of money, but i know tons of people who who couldn't afford college so they took out loans. Also a poor girl with stellar grades from the ghetto would be a prime candidate for financial aid. Another story ran on NPR the other day about how poor high acheivers should always aim for the best schools they can because their chances of getting financial aid are very good, and their earnings potential after graduation will be much higher\n\nText continuation:\nAs I pondered this, I couldn't help but think about the systemic barriers that often prevent students from low-income backgrounds from even considering higher education. It's not just a matter of applying to colleges and taking out loans, as RobotPigOverlord astutely pointed out. There are often deeper issues at play, such as a lack of access to quality education in the early years, limited exposure to college counseling, and a dearth of resources and support systems to help navigate the complex college application process.\nMoreover, the notion that a poor girl with stellar grades from the ghetto would be a prime candidate for financial aid is not always a guarantee. In reality, many students from low-income backgrounds face significant barriers in accessing financial aid, including limited access to information about available scholarships and grants, lack of familiarity with the college application process, and limited English proficiency.\nFurthermore, the NPR story that RobotPigOverlord mentioned highlights the importance of aiming for the best schools possible, as it can significantly impact a student's chances of receiving financial aid and their earnings potential after graduation. However, this advice can be particularly challenging for students from low-income backgrounds, who may not have the same level of access to resources and support systems that can help them navigate the college application process.\nIn addition, there are often societal and cultural barriers that can prevent students from low-income backgrounds from even considering higher education. For example, some students may not have family members or mentors who have attended college, which can make it difficult for them to see college as a viable option. Others may face cultural or social pressures that discourage them from pursuing higher education.\nDespite these challenges, there are many organizations and initiatives working to address the disparities in access to higher education for students from low-income backgrounds. For example, some colleges and universities are offering free or reduced-cost tuition to students from low-income backgrounds, while others are providing additional support services, such as mentorship programs and financial counseling.\nAdditionally, there are many non-profit organizations and government agencies working to provide resources and support to students from low-income backgrounds, such as the National College Attainment Network, which provides resources and support to help students from low-income backgrounds access and succeed in college.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that students from low-income backgrounds can and do take out loans to attend college, there are many systemic and societal barriers that can prevent them from even considering higher education. It is important to recognize these challenges and work to address them, so that all students have the opportunity to access and succeed in higher education.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"g\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The girl Melanie in this story was in the same boat, but i feel her bad attitude was what stopped her ultimately. \nProfessorRiffs: Maybe she's smart enough to not take out student loans?\nnotgod: Sometimes you have to take some risks. If a person knows what they want to do before college age, then go for it. Pour your heart and soul into your \"thing\" that you found to value so much, without the loans. But for the rest of us, we have the option to taking out the loans to expand our capabilities and maybe figure something else out what we want to do. There's always the option of not taking out loans when you don't have a \"thing\" but it will be more difficult to climb the economic ladder. That's almost assuming your goal is to climb the ladder, you are entirely entitled to not - you can stay exactly where you are or drop down a few rungs if you choose to not climb. \nOriginalStomper: &gt;Sometimes you have to take some risks.\nAgreed.  But the risks are disproportionately greater and more intimidating when you are a poor person of color with more chance the risk will not pay off and NO financial safety net.\nnotgod: If you're already poor and no way to pay it off - what is there to lose making an attempt? \nOriginalStomper: When you are poor with no credit, not paying your bills means getting evicted.  Not paying bills is serious.  The underprivileged know that the system works against them -- why should they believe they can take on debt with no adverse consequences?  How would they know?\nnotgod: Because then you're stuck in the same spot for the rest of your life. Pay the important bills, work with the billing company to get into a payment plan, get your shit turned off. Otherwise you're stuck. I'd rather try and fail then just spend my life doing the same thing. Read some biographies of people that have made it, they went for broke and succeeded by taking chances. Society wants you to keep paying your bills, fall in line, be average. If you're fine with that, good, if not, otherwise start making some changes and take some risks. Nobody is going to give you success. \nOriginalStomper: Stuck in the same spot struggling to pay rent and keep the utilities on is at least familiar for these people, and far less scary than being homeless.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Lithuania\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Because they are based on a straightforward formalism, they are used in many scientific fields from computer science to historical sciences. In this paper, we give an introduction to some methods relying on graphs for learning. This includes both unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in latent spaces and/or clustering the nodes. Both focus on extracting knowledge from graph topologies. While most existing techniques are only applicable to static graphs, where edges do not evolve through time, recent developments have shown that they could be extended to deal with evolving networks. In a supervised context, one generally aims at inferring labels\n\nText continuation:\n.\nFor instance, in the field of computer vision, graphs have been used to model the relationships between pixels in an image, allowing for the recognition of objects and scenes. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent pixels, and the edges represent the spatial relationships between them. By applying graph-based algorithms to this graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the image that are not easily discernible by other means. This has led to significant advances in image recognition and segmentation.\nIn addition to computer vision, graphs have also been used in other fields such as social network analysis, where they are used to model the relationships between individuals or groups. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent individuals or groups, and the edges represent the relationships between them, such as friendship, family relationships, or professional connections. By analyzing the graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the relationships between individuals or groups, which can be used to gain insights into social phenomena.\nFurthermore, graphs have also been used in biology to model the relationships between genes, proteins, and other biological molecules. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent the molecules, and the edges represent the interactions between them, such as protein-protein interactions or gene regulation. By analyzing the graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the relationships between molecules, which can be used to gain insights into biological processes and to identify potential therapeutic targets.\nIn conclusion, graphs are a powerful tool for characterizing interactions between objects of interest, and they have been used in a wide range of fields, from computer science to biology. By applying graph-based algorithms to these graphs, it is possible to extract knowledge and insights that would not be easily discernible by other means. As the field of graph-based learning continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more innovative applications of graphs in the future.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"g\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In this context, natural tasks include graph clustering (as in producing clusters of graphs rather than clusters of nodes in a single graph), graph classification, etc. 1 Real networks One of the first practical studies on graphs can be dated back to the original work of Moreno [51] in the 30s. Since then, there has been a growing interest in graph analysis associated with strong developments in the modelling and the processing of these data. Graphs are now used in many scientific fields. In Biology [54, 2, 7], for instance, metabolic networks can describe pathways of biochemical reactions [41], while in social sciences networks are used to represent relation ties between actors [66, 56, 36, 34]. Other examples include powergrids [71] and the web [75]. Recently, networks have also been considered in other areas such as geography [22] and history [59, 39]. In machine learning, networks are seen as powerful tools to model problems in order to extract information from data and for prediction purposes. This is the object of this paper. For more complete surveys, we refer to [28, 62, 49, 45]. In this section, we introduce notations and highlight properties shared by most real networks. In Section 2, we then consider methods aiming at extracting information from a unique network. We will particularly focus on clustering methods where the goal is to find clusters of vertices.

It's possible that the wires have been damaged over time due to wear and tear, or maybe they were never properly secured. Before attempting to connect the new dishwasher, it's essential to inspect the wires and ensure they are safe and suitable for use.\nFirst, let's take a closer look at the wires. The fat black wire from the wall appears to be a 10-gauge wire, which is typical for a 40-amp circuit. The fat white wire is likely the neutral wire, and the ground wire is, well, ground. The wires from the dishwasher are thinner and frayed, as you mentioned, but they appear to be the correct gauge and color-coded for the corresponding wires.\nTo proceed, I recommend checking the wires for any signs of damage, such as cuts, frays, or corrosion. If you find any damage, it's best to replace the wires to ensure a safe and reliable connection. You can use a wire tester to check for any issues with the wires, such as shorts or opens.\nOnce you've inspected the wires, you can proceed to connect the dishwasher. Make sure to match the wires correctly, using the color-coding as a guide. The black wire from the wall should be connected to the black wire from the dishwasher, and the white wire from the wall should be connected to the white wire from the dishwasher. The ground wire from the wall should be connected to the ground wire from the dishwasher.\nBefore turning on the power, double-check the connections to ensure they are secure and not loose. You can also use a voltage tester to verify that the power is off before proceeding.\nIf you're still unsure about the wiring or feel uncomfortable making the connections, it's always best to consult a licensed electrician. They can inspect the wiring and ensure it's safe and suitable for use.\nIn any case, I hope this helps you get started with replacing the old dishwasher. Remember to follow all safety precautions when working with electrical wiring, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"s\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The new dishwasher should have came with a new cord or you need to get one. Usually the dishwasher plugs into the same outlet as the garbage disposal would but one outlet is controlled by a switch meaning one outlet is always hot while the other is controlled by the switch. If there is only 1 hot coming do not worry about power or is still at 120ac \nbrock_lee: Where do you live?  In most of America the dishwasher is hard-wired and never comes with a plug-in cord. In fact, it is usually on a dedicated circuit which is code.\nghostfacr: This is correct and proper.  There is a junction box at the bottom front of like, every dishwasher.\ndfoley1313: That isn't code. Code is having a GFCI with dedicated circuit. You can use a pig tail to connect to the outlet under the sink, but yes you can connect hardwired. But again why do that, it is not a code issue and it is more of a pain in the ass to do so. Also Norther Cali \ngottapoop: Code in Canada doesn't require GFCI. Most dishwashers are hardwired here so you'd have to buy an expensive GFCI breaker. You sure about that code? Our codes are very similar\ndfoley1313: Yes gfci breaker is needed sorry forgot to put \"breaker\" in.  We always run 12/3 one goes to the top which stays hot then we break the tab run the other hot to the switch back to the bottom outlet and you have a outlet that has both a 20amp circuit. There is no problem doing a pig tail on a appliance and plugging it into a outlet instead of just hardwiring it to the device. Again it is a little extra work but it makes installing it easier and is code. I have done a lot of remodels of kitchens and inspectors ALWAYS check for this. \ngottapoop: Ya I just did a little googling and saw that our codes are definitely different for dishwashers. We don't even have anything relating to specifically to dishwashers just that they are a known motor and heating load so they have to be on their own circuit. Most are hardwired luckily because if you put them on a receptacle they would have to be on an AFCI due to new code rules requiring all receptacles unless otherwise stated needing to be AFCI protected.\nDoes the receptacle you install for the dishwasher go on the counter top and you run the power cable up or do you install under the kitchen sink and do the split receptacle thing for future additions like garberators or undercab lighting?\ndfoley1313: Goes under the cabinet usually in the sink base. Never thought of using it for under cab lighting usually just the disposal. Using the 12/3 and the split receptacle is the easiest way to do it. Now most of the times we don't even run a switch for the garbage disposal we just have them both hot but on different home runs, but use a air gap switch for the garbage disposal mounted on the sink.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Malta\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "rk"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

In essence, researchers have investigated the potential mnemonic properties of self-reference.\nResearch includes investigations into self-schema, self-concept and self-awareness as providing the foundation for self-reference's role in memory. Multiple explanations for the self-reference effect in memory exist, leading to a debate about the underlying processes involved in the self-reference effect. In addition, through the exploration of the self-reference effect, other psychological concepts have been discovered or supported, including simulation theory and the group reference effect.\nAfter researchers developed a concrete understanding of the self-reference effect, many expanded their investigations to consider the self-reference effect in particular groups like those with autism spectrum disorders or those experiencing depression.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Greenland\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Singapore Airlines was the first carrier in the world to operate the double-decker aircraft. No-one was injured in the incident involving the world's biggest airliner, a Singapore Airlines spokesman said, but passengers were taken off so the plane could be repositioned and inspected for any damage. A truck being used to push back the plane in preparation for the flight \"experienced some form of failure\" causing it disconnect from the aircraft, a Singapore Airlines spokesman said. \"As a consequence of the failure on the truck, the aircraft ... came into contact with the grass verge off the airport tarmac. The aircraft was not under its own power at the time,\" he said. \"It is too early at this time to know the cause of the incident but Singapore Airlines will investigate this quickly, and is filing reports with the appropriate Singapore authorities,\" the spokesman said. An airline spokesman told CNN's Richard Quest that four wheels had ended up on the grass.  All four tires had now been replaced.  \"As far as Singapore Airlilnes is concerned, the plane is ready to fly again,\" Quest said. The airline made arrangements for as many customers as possible to continue on their journey from Changi Airport to Sydney aboard a Boeing 747-400. Most passengers departed for Sydney on a new flight early Friday morning, while some others flew to alternate destinations such as Melbourne and Brisbane on existing flights. \"The remaining customers, about 10 of them, have left, or will be leaving, for Sydney today,\" the spokesman said. Singapore Airlines received its first A380 in October last year to become the first carrier in the world to operate the double-decker aircraft, which it is currently using for the Singapore-Sydney route. Changi Airport, which is home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, has declared itself ready to handle the plane. It widened and lengthened existing runways and widened runway shoulders to allow the plane to maneuver. Airports around the world have had to make changes to accommodate the A380, such as enlarging runways and gates and bringing in vehicles which can tow the plane and lift high enough to reach its upper decks.

It's almost as if they've been exposed to heat or moisture at some point, causing them to deform. This warping makes it even harder to get the tiles to fit back into their grid squares, as they're not sitting flat.\nI'm considering using a bit of tape or adhesive to help hold the tiles in place while I work on the wiring, but I'm worried that this might leave residue or damage the tiles in some way.

That kinda sorta works here, but it takes MANY taps and some just won't drop, and I'm afraid I'm going to break one.  \nI'm hoping there's some \"trick of the trade\" or life hack or whatever that someone knows which makes lowering such tiles back into place easy, or at least not this friggin' annoying. Thanks for your time.\n[deleted]: before putting them back up, I've shaved a bit off the edges of the tiles with a utility knife and drywall square.  That way you don't have to go through all of this if you need to take the tiles back down.\nThose ceilings are a bitch, aren't they?\nSQLDave: Brilliant. It never dawned on me to actually remove them. Are they that easy to shave without messing up? I assume the drywall square is to ensure they remain as square as possible?\n[deleted]: yes.  I would use a brand new blade and score the tile several times to cut through it (don't do it all at once)\nSQLDave: OK, so when you originally said \"shave\", my mind envisioned a \"scraping\" kind of action... but it looks like you're really suggesting an actual cut (even though I'll probably only be removing, like, 1/8\" - 1/4\").\n[deleted]: I would say so, even scraping would be ok but I think you would have a rough edge.  If you really wanted it, you could run it through a table saw with a fine blade, but scoring it with a sharp utility knife should work fine. \nYou won't see it and it will still stay up there because of the track, know what I mean?  \nTo get it out first, you can run a putty along the edge next to the track and pry the panel out of there.  That's what I've done.  If you break a tile you can always buy a new one if Lowes or Home Depot has a match.\nI hate these ceilings but sometimes there is no other choice\nIs that helpful?\nSQLDave: Very helpful. The ONLY bad part is these are harder than normal to get out with the insulation up there. &lt;sigh&gt;  Thanks again for the great ideas and followup.\n[deleted]: might end up popping out a couple more- like a lose one that is close by.  the track might have some give to it\nSQLDave: You have officially given me the courage to tackle this...now if I can just find the time :-)\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Iceland\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Since 1948, its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions.\nThe Masters has the smallest field of the four golf major championships.\nThe Masters is an invitation only tournament.\nPrevious Champions are eligible to play for life.\n\nSummary:\nAs with the other majors, winning the Masters gives a golfer several privileges which make his career more secure. Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship) for the next five years (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters. They also receive membership on the PGA Tour for the following five seasons and invitations to The Players Championship for five years.\nBecause the tournament was established by an amateur champion, Bobby Jones, the Masters has a tradition of honoring amateur golf. It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current U.S. Amateur champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is 1,200 square feet (110 m2) with lodging space for five during the competition.\nThe total prize money for the 2021 Masters Tournament was $11,500,000, with $2,070,000 going to the winner. In the inaugural year of 1934, the winner Horton Smith received $1,500 out of a $5,000 purse. After Nicklaus's first win in 1963, he received $20,000, while after his final victory in 1986 he won $144,000. In recent years the purse has grown quickly. Between 2001 and 2014, the winner's share grew by $612,000, and the purse grew by $3,400,000.\nGreen jacket\nIn addition to a cash prize, the winner of the tournament is presented with a distinctive green jacket, formally awarded since 1949 and informally awarded to the champions from the years prior. The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament in a televised ceremony, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the year after their victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they are present on the club grounds. Sam Snead was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket); Seve Ballesteros who, in an interview with Peter Alliss from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and Henry Picard, whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood, Ohio, where he was the club professional for many years.\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament. In 1966, Jack Nicklaus became the first player to win in consecutive years and he donned the jacket himself. When Nick Faldo (in 1990) and Tiger Woods (in 2002) repeated as champions, the chairman of Augusta National put the jacket on them.\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.\nThere are several awards presented to players who perform exceptional feats during the tournament. The player who has the daily lowest score receives a crystal vase, while players who score a hole-in-one or a double eagle win a large crystal bowl. For each eagle a player makes, they receive a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nDoes the summary mention the country \"Hungary\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Longo-Ciprelli: Fourth time lucky in Atlanta in 1996. For much of her career, the Olympic gold was the one honor to elude the French rider. Misfortune, it seemed, was to be her fate every four years, regardless of how many world championships she won in between. In 1984 the first women's Olympic road race coincided with Longo-Ciprelli's rise to dominance in the sport. Well-placed going into the final lap, she appeared set to challenge in the sprint, only to be knocked off in a collision. By 1988, Longo-Ciprelli was a three-time road race world champion, as well as a double winner of the women's Tour de France, and the clear favorite for gold in Seoul. But a broken hip a month before the Games derailed her preparations. Although she recovered enough to ride the road race, she could manage just 21st place. Tactical error More disappointment followed in Barcelona in 1992 as Longo-Ciprelli paid the price for a tactical error. With three kilometers to go, she raced away from the peloton and crossed the line in celebration. But she had failed to realize that Kathy Watt, an unheralded Australian, had slipped away from the lead group apparently unnoticed with a lap to go, and finished 20 seconds further in front. Four years later, in Atlanta, Longo-Ciprelli, finally cracked her Olympic jinx. At 37, Longo-Ciprelli was no longer the dominant presence she had once been, but she still possessed the ability to raise her performance for the biggest races, as she had proven by winning her fourth road race world title in 1995. Her preparations were typically unorthodox -- while her rivals were acclimatizing to the Atlanta heat, Longo-Ciprelli trained alone in the mountains of Colorado, arriving just two days before the race. The race itself was run in a sudden downpour, which sent many riders crashing and skidding and had the rest struggling to stay on their bikes. Unruffled, Longo-Ciprelli broke clear with two other riders and then launched her gold-winning solo attack 11 kilometers from the finish. Longo-Ciprelli was back for her fifth and final Olympics in Sydney in 2000 at the age of 41, this time claiming bronze in the time trial -- and event in which she had also won silver in 1996.

If it does sense electrical activity, it will hold off stimulating. This sensing and stimulating activity continues on a beat by beat basis and is called \"demand pacing\". In the case of a dual-chamber device, when the upper chambers have a spontaneous or stimulated activation, the device starts a countdown to ensure that in an acceptable \u2013 and programmable \u2013 interval, there is an activation of the ventricle, otherwise again an impulse will be delivered.\n\nSummary:\nPacemakers or cardiac pacemakers usually refer to artificial cardiac pacemakers, since our body has a natural cardiac pacemaker. \nThe artificial cardiac pacemakers work by detecting electric signals through the conductive leads that are attached to the inside of heart walls, usually in atriums, and, in the absence of an electrical signal, generate one to stimulate the desired heart area, either an atrium or a ventricle.\n\nDoes the summary mention the country \"Belgium\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

For instance, the use of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology has been shown to provide highly accurate topographic data, even in complex urban environments. Additionally, the integration of multiple data sources, such as aerial imagery and ground-based sensors, can help to reduce errors and improve the overall accuracy of DEMs.\nFurthermore, the development of advanced computational methods and algorithms has enabled the creation of more sophisticated flood models that can better account for the complexities of overland flow and the influence of above-ground elements. These models can be used to simulate a wide range of flood scenarios, from small-scale flash floods to large-scale riverine floods, and can provide valuable insights into the behavior of floodwaters and the potential impacts of different flood mitigation strategies.\nDespite these advances, there is still much work to be done to fully understand the complexities of flood modeling and to develop more accurate and reliable flood risk assessments. Ongoing research is focused on addressing the challenges of DEM generation and refinement, as well as the development of more advanced computational methods and algorithms for flood modeling. By continuing to push the boundaries of what is possible with aerial photogrammetry and other technologies, researchers and practitioners can work together to improve our understanding of flood risk and to develop more effective strategies for mitigating the impacts of flood events.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"t\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The purpose of this study is to investigate uncertainties related to (i) the own error of high resolution topographic data, and (ii) the modeller choices when including topographic data in hydraulic codes. The aim is to perform a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) which goes through a Monte-Carlo uncertainty propagation, to quantify impact of uncertainties, followed by a Sobol' indices computation, to rank influence of identified parameters on result variability. A process using a coupling of an environment for parametric computation (Prom{\\'e}th{\\'e}e) and a code relying on 2D shallow water equations (FullSWOF 2D) has been developed (P-FS tool). The study has been performed over the lower part of the Var river valley using the estimated hydrograph of 1994 flood event. HR topographic data has been made available for the study area, which is 17.5 km 2 , by Nice municipality. Three uncertain parameters were studied: the measurement error (var. E), the level of details of above-ground element representation in DEM (buildings, sidewalks, etc.) (var. S), and the spatial discretization resolution (grid cell size for regular mesh) (var. R). Parameter var. E follows a probability density function, whereas parameters var. S and var. R. are discrete operator choices. Combining these parameters, a database of 2, 000 simulations has been produced using P-FS tool implemented on a high performance computing structure.

Unexpectedly\n\nText continuation:\n, other homozygous patients presented a distinct delayed phenotype of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism after 50 years; none had epilepsy or cerebellar ataxia. Another major finding of this study is that all GRN mutations may not have the same impact on progranulin protein synthesis. A hypomorphic effect of some mutations is supported by the presence of residual levels of plasma progranulin and low levels of normal transcript detected in one case with a homozygous splice-site mutation and late onset frontotemporal dementia. This is a new critical finding that must be considered in therapeutic trials based on replacement strategies. The first neuropathological study in a homozygous carrier provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of the disease. Hallmarks of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were present. The absence of TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions markedly differs from observations of heterozygous mutations, suggesting a pathological shift between lysosomal and TDP-43 pathologies depending on the mono or bi-allelic status. An intriguing observation was the loss of normal TDP-43 staining in the nucleus of some neurons, which could be the first stage of the TDP-43 pathological process preceding the formation of typical cytoplasmic inclusions. Finally, this study has important implications for genetic counselling and molecular diagnosis. Semi-dominant inheritance of GRN mutations implies that specific genetic counseling should be delivered to children and parents of CLN11 patients, as they are heterozygous carriers with a high risk of developing dementia. More broadly, this study illustrates the fact that genetic variants can lead to different phenotypes according to their mono- or bi-allelic state, which is a challenge for genetic diagnosis.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Serbia\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Although there are many styles of motorcycles, they are loosely organized into 6 main categories.  These categories most closely align to the intended use of the vehicle.  There is your standard motorcycle, your more relaxed cruising motorcycle, the larger capacity and longer haul touring cycle, a racing more sportier sports cycle and then you have a off-road motorcycle often known as a dirtbike and lastly a dual-sport which is a motorcycle that can go both on and offroad.\n\nDoes the summary mention the country \"Guinea\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Fishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture. Such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer. The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island. \"I very quickly realized two things,\" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. \"One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change.\" \"The other thing was that it meant it was really happening. It wasn't a joke. It wasn't just statistics. It was really happening.\" He calls his discovery Warming Island. Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming. Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography. In the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores. Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life. Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious. The Earth's temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius). The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council. The temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day. There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say. A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the sun's radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling. The reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC. The presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the EPA. Meanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years. Many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests. \"For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it,\" Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said. \"A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming,\" he added. Many scientific organizations share Schneider's view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union. But there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"We've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves,\" he said. \"When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling. Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming.\" He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal. \"The Earth is always getting colder and warmer,\" he said. \"It's always changing. In fact, this is true of any fluid-covered planet.\" Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained. \"We don't know why, but it's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they've occurred,\" he said. \"What we're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that's occurring due to global warming.\" Yet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. \"We're already in serious melt, nobody can explain it. The models don't predict it,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going on up there. All we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty.\" The greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world's nations. The IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius) by 2100. The lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said. The higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of Hollywood filmmakers. Uncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models. The models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere, oceans and continents interact, all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them. \"Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know,\" Schneider said. \"That it's going to warm up? I'd bet anything on that.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nSummary:\nExplorer Dennis Schmitt discovered an island near Greenland, which he named Warming Island.\nThe island was once thought to be a peninsula, but melting ice revealed its distinct shape.\nSchmitt believes the discovery is significant because it shows climate change is real.\nHe says the island is an example of the consequences of global warming.\n\nDoes the summary contain the letter \"i\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The pope arrives to address U.S. bishops in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He spoke at a prayer service with U.S. bishops at Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Roman Catholic church in North America. Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a \"deep shame\" and called it \"gravely immoral behavior.\" \"Many of you have spoken to me of the enormous pain that your communities have suffered when clerics have betrayed ... their obligations,\" he told the bishops. Responding to the situation has not been easy and was sometimes very badly handled, the pope admitted.  Watch the pope address the issue \u00bb . \"It is vitally important that the vulnerable are always shielded from souls who would cause harm,\" he said. The pope then turned his attention to a different concern involving kids. \"What does it mean to speak of child protection when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many homes through media widely available today?\" he asked. Benedict urged the media and entertainment industry to take part in a \"moral renewal.\" Earlier Wednesday, President Bush, first lady Laura Bush and more than 13,500 spectators welcomed Benedict in an elaborate ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House.

The pope arrives to address U.S. bishops in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He spoke at a prayer service with U.S. bishops at Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Roman Catholic church in North America. Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a \"deep shame\" and called it \"gravely immoral behavior.\" \"Many of you have spoken to me of the enormous pain that your communities have suffered when clerics have betrayed ... their obligations,\" he told the bishops. Responding to the situation has not been easy and was sometimes very badly handled, the pope admitted.  Watch the pope address the issue \u00bb . \"It is vitally important that the vulnerable are always shielded from souls who would cause harm,\" he said. The pope then turned his attention to a different concern involving kids. \"What does it mean to speak of child protection when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many homes through media widely available today?\" he asked. Benedict urged the media and entertainment industry to take part in a \"moral renewal.\" Earlier Wednesday, President Bush, first lady Laura Bush and more than 13,500 spectators welcomed Benedict in an elaborate ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. In remarks greeting the pope to the White House, Bush called the United States \"a nation of prayer.\" Bush was interrupted by applause as he said, \"In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded, we need your message that all human life is sacred and that each of us is willed.\" Benedict responded by praising the role of religion in the United States. \"From the dawn of the republic, America's quest for freedom has been guided by the conviction that the principles governing political and social life are intimately linked to a moral order based on the dominion of God the creator,\" he said.

The project consists of a 3.5 km (2.2 mi) long double-track rail tunnel underneath Auckland's city centre, between Waitemat\u0101 (Britomart) and Maungawhau (Mount Eden) railway stations. Two new underground stations will be constructed to serve the city centre: Te Waihorotiu near Aotea Square and Karanga-a-Hape near Karangahape Road. Waitemat\u0101 will be converted from a terminus station into a through station, and Mount Eden station will be replaced by Maungawhau station, a new station with four platforms to serve as an interchange between the new CRL line and the existing Western Line.\nThe current project is an adapted version of previous proposals to improve rail access to Auckland's city centre with\n\nText continuation:\na focus on increasing capacity and reducing congestion on the rail network. The project aims to provide a reliable and efficient public transport system, connecting the city centre with the surrounding suburbs and regions. The CRL will also provide a vital link to the airport, with a new station planned at the airport to provide easy access to the city centre.\nThe construction of the CRL is expected to be completed by 2024, with the new stations and tunnel expected to be operational by 2025. The project is being delivered by a joint venture of construction companies, including Downer EDI Works, Obayashi Corporation, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The project is being funded by the New Zealand government, Auckland Council, and Auckland Transport, with an estimated cost of NZD 4.4 billion.\nOnce completed, the CRL will provide numerous benefits to the city and its residents, including increased capacity, reduced congestion, and improved air quality. The project will also create new economic opportunities and stimulate growth in the city centre. With the CRL, Auckland will be able to better accommodate its growing population and provide a more efficient and reliable public transport system, making it a more attractive place to live, work, and visit.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"i\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The increase in rail patronage in Auckland during the early 21st century, particularly after the opening of Britomart Transport Centre in 2003, led to renewed interest in the scheme. The 2012 Auckland Spatial Plan highlighted the CRL as the most important transport investment for Auckland and the project has enjoyed strong public support. Its planning and funding have also been the subject of controversy.\nIn June 2013, the central government announced its support for the project with a construction commencement date of 2020, four years later than Auckland Council's preferred start date of 2016.

Once published, it will inform the next steps for higher education funding in Wales.\"\n\nSummary:\nThe way Welsh students are funded is unsustainable, the body representing universities in Wales has said.\n\nDoes the summary mention the country \"Qatar\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "rk"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "elters"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

It\u2019s weird but the sociological aspect of friendship is commonality not effort.  Things you enjoy doing or along those lines should be a commonality. With effort you\u2019re seeking a commonality of seeking friendship which isn\u2019t wrong but shouldn\u2019t be an enjoyment of everyday.\n\nAll else fails join my discord and we can game lol\nmaster-ozymandias: thats a really good way of putting it. but i just don't understand how to make shit happen with this stuff. in my old city friends just seemed to come into my life, now i havent had a single person i could call a friend and i dont know how to change that.\nRight-Gas-5379: I have a plan how bout for one month go do everything you do normal or cool stuff, but don\u2019t actively try and make friends with anyone at all. Be normal nice you living your life with no friend seeking or wanting of a friend. Be ok by yourself. Others will see your comfort in being your self and they will seek you.\nStars shine planets gather, shine at something my friend they will come.\nTLDR: I\u2019m high on good weed.\nmaster-ozymandias: i guess in some ways i feel a bit desperate for an actual friend so i see what you mean by being okay with myself. im gonna give it a shot and report back in august.\nalso that last part made me laugh my ass off lol, enjoy the ride hahaha\nRight-Gas-5379: Glad I could make you laugh, emotions and needs are seen on the face and felt emotionally. Our brain processes our facial movements at levels we can\u2019t comprehend but while on lsd I noticed what we don\u2019t see with the naked eye is that our face gives away our inner feelings faster than we can see or control. LSD slowed the facial motions down perspectively that\u2019s when i realized our inner feelings are being projected out no matter what.

If he donated 99% of it ($356,400,400) he would have close to 3.6 million dollars and you would still consider him an asshole.\nTypicalPractice: 99.9% of it then!\nRainbwned: Leaving him with 360,000. So everyone who has over 360K is an asshole. Consider the value of certain houses, that could be a large portion\n\nText continuation:\nThis line of thinking can quickly become absurd. For instance, if we apply the same logic to other forms of wealth, such as art collections or rare collectibles, we could easily find ourselves in a situation where anyone with a certain level of wealth is deemed an asshole. This raises questions about the morality of accumulating wealth and the responsibility that comes with it.\nIt's also worth considering the motivations behind someone's decision to hold onto their wealth. Perhaps Keanu Reeves is holding onto his money for a specific reason, such as to provide for his loved ones or to support a particular cause. Maybe he's simply not interested in donating to charity, and that's his prerogative.\nMoreover, the idea that someone who donates 99% of their wealth is automatically a good person is overly simplistic. There are many factors that contribute to a person's character, and their financial decisions are just one aspect of it. We should focus on evaluating people based on their actions and values, rather than their bank account balance.\nIn conclusion, the notion that every multimillionaire is automatically an asshole is an oversimplification that doesn't take into account the complexities of human nature. While it's true that some people with significant wealth may be selfish or entitled, it's not fair to make sweeping generalizations about an entire group of people based on their financial status.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"t\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

So it was better to be safe than sorry.\nWhen I cut them right before \"action time\", I ended up losing like 3 or 4 in a pack of 12. I don't care about the money, but losing the condoms.

My parents didn't mention it, and I'm not sure if they'd even know. The house was built in the 70s, and I'm guessing the wiring is probably original. The dishwasher is at least 30 years old, and I'm not sure if it's been replaced or upgraded since then.\nI'm a bit concerned about the frayed wires, as they seem to be a bit worn out. I'm not an electrician, but I've heard that frayed wires can be a fire hazard. Should I be worried about this? Is it safe to connect the new dishwasher to the old wiring, or should I consider hiring a professional to take a look?\nI've also noticed that the wires from the wall are quite fat, while the ones from the dishwasher are thinner. Is this normal? Should I be concerned about the difference in size? I've heard that thicker wires can handle more power, but I'm not sure if this applies to the situation.\nI've attached some pictures of the wires for reference. The first one is the fat black wire coming from the wall, and the second one is the thinner black wire from the dishwasher.

The new dishwasher should have came with a new cord or you need to get one. Usually the dishwasher plugs into the same outlet as the garbage disposal would but one outlet is controlled by a switch meaning one outlet is always hot while the other is controlled by the switch. If there is only 1 hot coming do not worry about power or is still at 120ac \nbrock_lee: Where do you live?  In most of America the dishwasher is hard-wired and never comes with a plug-in cord. In fact, it is usually on a dedicated circuit which is code.\nghostfacr: This is correct and proper.  There is a junction box at the bottom front of like, every dishwasher.\ndfoley1313: That isn't code. Code is having a GFCI with dedicated circuit. You can use a pig tail to connect to the outlet under the sink, but yes you can connect hardwired. But again why do that, it is not a code issue and it is more of a pain in the ass to do so. Also Norther Cali \ngottapoop: Code in Canada doesn't require GFCI. Most dishwashers are hardwired here so you'd have to buy an expensive GFCI breaker. You sure about that code? Our codes are very similar\ndfoley1313: Yes gfci breaker is needed sorry forgot to put \"breaker\" in.  We always run 12/3 one goes to the top which stays hot then we break the tab run the other hot to the switch back to the bottom outlet and you have a outlet that has both a 20amp circuit. There is no problem doing a pig tail on a appliance and plugging it into a outlet instead of just hardwiring it to the device. Again it is a little extra work but it makes installing it easier and is code. I have done a lot of remodels of kitchens and inspectors ALWAYS check for this. \ngottapoop: Ya I just did a little googling and saw that our codes are definitely different for dishwashers. We don't even have anything relating to specifically to dishwashers just that they are a known motor and heating load so they have to be on their own circuit. Most are hardwired luckily because if you put them on a receptacle they would have to be on an AFCI due to new code rules requiring all receptacles unless otherwise stated needing to be AFCI protected.\nDoes the receptacle you install for the dishwasher go on the counter top and you run the power cable up or do you install under the kitchen sink and do the split receptacle thing for future additions like garberators or undercab lighting?\ndfoley1313: Goes under the cabinet usually in the sink base. Never thought of using it for under cab lighting usually just the disposal. Using the 12/3 and the split receptacle is the easiest way to do it. Now most of the times we don't even run a switch for the garbage disposal we just have them both hot but on different home runs, but use a air gap switch for the garbage disposal mounted on the sink.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Tunisia\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "rk"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

It's like they're assuming everyone is just fine with their personal information being shared with the world. Newsflash, Facebook: not everyone is okay with that. Some people actually value their privacy and want to keep certain things to themselves.\nAnd another thing, what's with the message saying \"some of your settings have changed\"? What settings? Which ones? Why didn't they just say \"we changed all your privacy settings to public\"? Transparency is key, Facebook. You can't just change people's settings without telling them what you're doing.\nI'm not saying I'm surprised, though. Facebook has a history of doing shady things with people's data. Remember that time they allowed third-party apps to access your friends' information without their consent? Yeah, that was a real classy move.\nBut I digress.

The method of deriving photometric metallicities using red giant branch stars is applied to resolved stellar populations under the common assumption that they mainly consist of single-age old stellar populations. We explore the effect of the presence of mixed-age stellar populations on deriving photometric metallicities. Methods. We use photometric data sets for the five Galactic dwarf spheroidals Sculptor, Sextans, Carina, Fornax, and Leo II in order to derive their photometric metallicity distribution functions from their resolved red giant branches using isochrones of the Dartmouth Stellar Evolutionary Database. We compare the photometric metallicities with published spectroscopic metallicities based on the analysis of the near-infrared Ca triplet (Ca T), both on the metallicity scale\n\nText continuation:\nof the scale of the spectroscopic analysis.\nResults. We find that the presence of mixed-age stellar populations can significantly affect the derived photometric metallicities, leading to systematic offsets and broadening of the metallicity distribution functions. The offsets are found to be more pronounced in the metal-poorer populations, where the contamination from younger stars can be more significant. We also find that the photometric metallicities derived from the Ca T analysis are generally more metal-poor than those derived from the photometric method, likely due to the fact that the Ca T analysis is more sensitive to the presence of younger stars.\nDiscussion. Our results highlight the importance of considering the effects of mixed-age stellar populations when deriving photometric metallicities from resolved stellar populations. The presence of younger stars can significantly affect the derived metallicities, particularly in metal-poor populations. The use of isochrones and the Dartmouth Stellar Evolutionary Database provides a powerful tool for deriving photometric metallicities, but it is essential to consider the potential biases and uncertainties introduced by the presence of mixed-age stellar populations. Future studies should aim to develop methods that can account for the effects of mixed-age populations and provide more accurate and reliable photometric metallicities.\nConclusion. In this study, we have explored the effects of mixed-age stellar populations on deriving photometric metallicities from resolved stellar populations. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the presence of mixed-age populations when interpreting photometric metallicities and highlight the need for more accurate and reliable methods for deriving photometric metallicities. Future studies should aim to develop methods that can account for the effects of mixed-age populations and provide more accurate and reliable photometric metallicities.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"n\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "###"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In addition, we compare the photometric metallicities with published spectroscopic metallicities based on spectral synthesis and medium-resolution spectroscopy, and on high resolution spectra where available. Results. The mean properties of the spectroscopic and photometric metallicity samples are comparable within the intrinsic scatter of each method although the mean metallicities of dSphs with pronounced intermediate-age population fractions may be underestimated by the photometric method by up to a few tenths of dex in [Fe/H]. The star-by-star differences of the spectroscopic minus the photometric metallicities show a wide range of values along the fiducial spectroscopic metallicity range, with the tendency to have systematically lower photometric metallicities for those dwarf spheroidals with a higher fraction of intermediate-age populations. Such discrepancies persist even in the case of the purely old Sculptor dSph, where one would na\\\"ively expect a very good match when comparing with medium or low resolution metallicity measurements. Overall, the agreement between Ca T metallicities and photometric metallicities is very good in the metallicity range from ~ -2 dex to ~ -1.5 dex. We find that the photometric method is reliable in galaxies that contain small (less than 15%) intermediate-age stellar fractions. Therefore, in the presence of mixed-age stellar populations, one needs to quantify the fraction of the intermediate-age stars in order to assess their effect on determining metallicities from photometry alone. Finally, we note that the comparison of spectroscopic metallicities of the same stars obtained with different methods reveals similarly large discrepancies as the comparison with photometric metallicities.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Djibouti\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

To combat this phenomenon, two national parks in the county started limiting second home ownership in the area, requiring proof of local need or strong ties in the area.\n\nDoes the summary mention the country \"Liberia\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

This would enable a more accurate assessment of their financial health and, subsequently, a more informed decision-making process by investors, regulators, and other stakeholders.\nFurthermore, the adoption of eco-systemic prudential policies would also encourage the development of new financial instruments and products that take into account the environmental and social dimensions of companies' activities. For instance, green bonds, which are specifically designed to finance environmentally friendly projects, could be used to channel funds towards sustainable infrastructure development. Similarly, impact investing, which aims to generate both financial returns and positive social or environmental impact, could become a more prominent feature of the financial landscape.\nBy promoting eco-systemic prudential policies, we can create a more sustainable and resilient financial system that supports the transition to a low-carbon economy. This would require a coordinated effort from policymakers, regulators, financial institutions, and companies to develop and implement new standards, frameworks, and instruments that reflect the interdependence between economic, environmental, and social dimensions.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"m\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "Answer"}, "layer14_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "P"}, "layer14_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": ""}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer15_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "b", "answer_neg": "This"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult9": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult12": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult15": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The State would then be the guarantor in order to facilitate their access to financing, also reduced by Basel III and Solvency II. This policy develops a system of reallocation of financing capacities from non-virtuous companies to the most virtuous ones with public guarantees, aiming to reduce the debt ratio while increasing green investments, with monetary policies of rates but also of volumes and ratios differentiated according to the types of assets and the greening of bank balance sheets, and finally forms of public-private partnership. Facilitating the financing of green companies would green capital but increase it, partly neutralising the positive environmental impact. It is therefore necessary to limit the credit expansion of ''brown'' companies. This would reduce risky operations and favour less leveraged investments more connected to the real economy, reducing systemic financial risk. -- The Agenda 2030 Policy Briefs series (PoCFiN Kedge Business School - SDSN France - Institut Rousseau) mobilises economists and practitioners to identify an agenda of economic and financial reforms to achieve the 2030 Agenda, at territorial, national and supranational levels.
