Sthread operates directly on multithreaded C/C++ programs, without the need for an intermediate formal model. Sthread is in-vivo in that it provides a drop-in replacement for the pthread library, and operates directly on the compiled target executable and application libraries. There is no compiler-generated intermediate representation. The system calls in the application remain unaltered. Optionally, the programmer can add a small amount of additional native C code to include assertions based on the user's algorithm, declarations of shared memory regions, and progress/liveness conditions. The work has two important motivations: (i) It can be used to verify correctness of a\n\nText continuation:\nmultithreaded program by checking if it satisfies the desired properties, such as freedom from deadlocks, livelocks, and data races. This can be done by specifying the properties as a set of assertions, which are then checked by Sthread at runtime. (ii) It can also be used to analyze and debug multithreaded programs by providing insights into the program's behavior, such as the order in which threads execute, the values of shared variables, and the points of contention.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n\nText start", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": No.\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": No.\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No.\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The work has two important motivations: (i) It can be used to verify correctness of a\n\nText continuation:\nconcurrent algorithm being implemented with multithreading; and (ii) it can also be used pedagogically to provide immediate feedback to students learning either to employ POSIX threads system calls or to implement multithreaded algorithms. This work represents the first example of in-vivo model checking operating directly on the standard multithreaded executable and its libraries, without the aid of a compiler-generated intermediate representation. Sthread leverages the open-source SimGrid libraries, and will eventually be integrated into SimGrid. Sthread employs a non-preemptive model in which thread context switches occur only at multithreaded system calls (e.g., mutex, semaphore) or before accesses to shared memory regions. The emphasis is on finding \"algorithmic bugs\" (bugs in an original algorithm, implemented as POSIX threads and shared memory regions. This work is in contrast to Context-Bounded Analysis (CBA), which assumes a preemptive model for threads, and emphasizes implementation bugs such as buffer overruns and write-after-free for memory allocation. In particular, the Sthread in-vivo approach has strong future potential for pedagogy, by providing immediate feedback to students who are first learning the correct use of Pthreads system calls in implementation of concurrent algorithms based on multithreading.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n\nText start", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The district also offers a range of extracurricular activities, including sports teams, music and art programs, and clubs. The district's faculty and staff work together to provide a supportive and inclusive learning environment that fosters the academic, social, and emotional growth of its students.\nIn addition to its academic programs, the district also places a strong emphasis on community involvement and outreach. The district partners with local organizations and businesses to provide opportunities for students to engage in community service and learn about the importance of giving back to their community.

Singapore Airlines was the first carrier in the world to operate the double-decker aircraft. No-one was injured in the incident involving the world's biggest airliner, a Singapore Airlines spokesman said, but passengers were taken off so the plane could be repositioned and inspected for any damage. A truck being used to push back the plane in preparation for the flight \"experienced some form of failure\" causing it disconnect from the aircraft, a Singapore Airlines spokesman said. \"As a consequence of the failure on the truck, the aircraft ... came into contact with the grass verge off the airport tarmac. The aircraft was not under its own power at the time,\" he said. \"It is too early at this time to know the cause of the incident but Singapore Airlines will investigate this quickly, and is filing reports with the appropriate Singapore authorities,\" the spokesman said. An airline spokesman told CNN's Richard Quest that four wheels had ended up on the grass.  All four tires had now been replaced.  \"As far as Singapore Airlilnes is concerned, the plane is ready to fly again,\" Quest said. The airline made arrangements for as many customers as possible to continue on their journey from Changi Airport to Sydney aboard a Boeing 747-400. Most passengers departed for Sydney on a new flight early Friday morning, while some others flew to alternate destinations such as Melbourne and Brisbane on existing flights. \"The remaining customers, about 10 of them, have left, or will be leaving, for Sydney today,\" the spokesman said. Singapore Airlines received its first A380 in October last year to become the first carrier in the world to operate the double-decker aircraft, which it is currently using for the Singapore-Sydney route. Changi Airport, which is home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, has declared itself ready to handle the plane. It widened and lengthened existing runways and widened runway shoulders to allow the plane to maneuver. Airports around the world have had to make changes to accommodate the A380, such as enlarging runways and gates and bringing in vehicles which can tow the plane and lift high enough to reach its upper decks.

I lived in New Jersey in the USA, and I called the Mental Health Association in New Jersey,  Inc. at  [1-877-292-5588](https://www.mhanj.org/our-call-lines/).\nDo a search to find the one in your area. There is no limit to the number of times you can call or to what you can say. Speaking to someone who has been through what you're going through is like being cradled in true understanding. \n\nMental Health America has a good [list](https://screening.mhanational.org/content/need-talk-someone-warmlines/) of warmlines in the United States.\nelastic-craptastic: As a paranoid depressive, do they demand personal info?  I don't want a log kept on me without express permission.\nKimjongnacca: They make no intrusive demands of you. However, they need some personal info because they keep in touch. They do follow-up calls to make sure you're still OK later. They confer with each other to make sure you're being helped effectively. If they think you are a serious threat to yourself or others, they can send someone to help you; but it's almost exclusively just you having a conversation with an empathetic peer. \nBe well my friend.\nelastic-craptastic: I just don't wanna be a debbie downer to my friends but have no one that understands my personal struggles.   They are very specific, and though we all go through shit, I feel like my shit is pretty unique.\nBut I don't want my needing to bitch turn into a DSS case as I still take care of my family.

However, I do have a few suggestions to consider:\n* For strengthening your back, you may want to consider adding some exercises that target the latissimus dorsi muscles, such as pull-ups or assisted pull-ups. You're already doing chin-ups, which is a great start, but you may want to consider increasing the difficulty by adding weight or using a resistance band.\n* For your wrists and forearms, you're doing a good job with the grip exercises and fingertip planks. However, you may want to consider adding some exercises that target the forearm muscles, such as wrist curls or forearm extensions.\n* For handstand push-ups, you may want to consider adding some exercises that target the shoulder muscles, such as push-ups or shoulder press. You're already doing decline pike push-ups, which is a great exercise for building strength, but you may want to consider adding some variations to target different muscle groups.\nHere's an example of how you could modify your routine to incorporate some of these suggestions:\nOn Days (every 2nd day):\n* Warm-Up w. Wrist Warm-Up (10min)\n* 4x3 Chin-Ups (Building strength for Pull-Ups)\n* 3x4 Beginner Shrimp Squats\n* 3x8 Decline Pike Push-Ups\n* 3x8 Flat Straight Leg Raises\n* 3x15s Fingertip Planks (Weak wrists, building strength for Fingertip Push-Ups)\n* 3x30s Arched Hold\n* 3x45s Reverse Plank Bridge\n* 3x30s Hollow Body Hold\n* 3x10 Wrist Curls (Forearm strength)\n* 3x10 Forearm Extensions (Forearm strength)\n* 3x8 Pull-Ups (Building strength for Handstand Push-Ups)\n* 3x60s Weighed Plank\n* 10s [Yaad Lean](http://antranik.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/yaad-lean.jpg)\n* Cool-Down (6-7min)\nOff Days\nYou could also consider adding some active recovery exercises on your off days, such as light cardio or yoga, to help with recovery and prevent injury. Additionally, you may want to consider increasing the difficulty of your exercises over time by adding weight, increasing the number of reps, or decreasing rest time between sets.\nOverall, your routine is a great start, and with a few modifications, you can continue to make progress towards your goals.

But why stop there ? Is time a constraint ?\nYou can strengthen pretty much the whole body if you add in progressions for horizontal push(PPPUs) and pull (Tuck lever rows) to your current routine which already has vertical push, pull and legs. You might have to split up the days into push/pull days like in the recommend routine or into verical/horizontal days (my current routine) with rest days inbetween. \nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Train everything so that there are no weak links. The choice is upto you though :)\nihatepepperballs: Back and forearms/wrists are my biggest weakness right now, so that's what I'm focusing on.\nBy the way: how could I split this into two parts? I would like to do the first half in the morning, then the second one in the afternoon.\nThanks for the input :)\nn3ox1ne: Its a 2 day split. For example, Monday would be horizontal day with pushups/rows/core. Tuesday would be rest day and Wednesday would be vertical day with pullups/dips(will move to hspu after getting good stable handstands)/legs. Thursday would be rest and Friday would be horizontal again and it just repeats like that every day, rest, train, rest.\nThis is my personal routine modified from the recommend one. It makes sense to me and works for me. It might be different for you. Stick to the recommend routine for 2 or 3 months atleast and then make changes if needed. Good luck and enjoy this journey :D\nihatepepperballs: I feel like that's too much rest time, especially for a teenager. I want action, dammit :D\nAre you sure it would be more beneficial to split it into two days when I could do the whole thing in one?\nn3ox1ne: Your recovery time will have to increase especially after progressing to the intermediate movements. The tendons and joints will need more rest between sessions. Otherwise you will overtrain the body and get injured. Remember this is not a race. Take it slow and stay injury free. This is all my opinion though. To praphrase Phi \"Stick to the goddamn recommend routine\" xD\nihatepepperballs: I always feel so lazy on rest days.\n*What do you mean I have to ACTIVELY do nothing?*\nOh well, I guess it must be so then.\nAlso, I love that you used an emoticon after every reply.\nxD\nn3ox1ne: You don't have to do nothing (double negatives ftw) on rest days.You can do some running or stretching or yoga or some light sports.

I might need to put training on the back burner for a while, because life, but I'd like to maintain my current strength if I can, while cutting back on time.\nHow little time could I put in and hope to maintain my strength for a few months? Should I  do the RR twice a week? Once? For the strength exercises, would one set of my max reps, once a week, be enough? Or less?

CMV\nI think I can sort of understand economic issues with how marriage laws work in relation to benefits and taxes -- in these cases I could see polygamy as a clever method of tax evasion or something of the sort. Also, I see that it is morally wrong when, say, one partner is not aware that there is a third partner in a certain marriage/relationship. But personally, I see nothing morally or ethically wrong with polygamy if it is between clearly consenting adults. CMV! :)\nFallingSnowAngel: Are we talking about polygamy in an ideal world, as an abstract, or polygamy in a world where wealthy men frequently compete to accumulate as many beautiful wives as possible, replacing them as needed, while their sons are treated\n\nText continuation:\nlike disposable property?\nAlienArchitect: Ah, I see what you're getting at. You're highlighting the potential for exploitation and power imbalances in a polygamous system. And I agree, those are definitely concerns that need to be addressed. But I still don't think that's a reason to dismiss the concept of polygamy entirely.\nFallingSnowAngel: But isn't that the problem? We're so quick to dismiss the potential for harm and exploitation, and instead focus on the theoretical benefits of polygamy, without considering the very real-world implications. And what about the women in these situations? Are they truly consenting, or are they being coerced or manipulated into these relationships?\nAlienArchitect: That's a fair point, and I think it's important to acknowledge that power imbalances can and do occur in any relationship, not just polygamous ones. But I still think that with proper laws and regulations in place, polygamy could be a viable option for some people. And what about the women who do choose to be in polygamous relationships? Shouldn't their agency and autonomy be respected?\nFallingSnowAngel: I'm not saying that women in polygamous relationships don't have agency or autonomy. But I am saying that we need to be critical of the systems and structures that enable and perpetuate these relationships. And what about the children who are born into these families? How do they fare in a system where there is no clear parental authority or responsibility?\nAlienArchitect: That's a great point, and I think it's something that needs to be addressed. But I still think that with the right support systems and resources in place, polygamous families could thrive. And what about the benefits of polygamy? Don't we need to consider the potential advantages of having multiple caregivers and role models in a child's life?\nFallingSnowAngel: I see what you're saying, but I'm not convinced that the benefits of polygamy outweigh the potential drawbacks. And what about the societal implications? Don't we need to consider how polygamy would affect our social norms and institutions? Would it lead to a more equitable and just society, or would it exacerbate existing power imbalances and inequalities?\nAlienArchitect: I think that's a great question, and one that needs to be explored. But I still think that polygamy, or at least the idea of it, is worth considering. And who knows, maybe in the future, we'll have a more nuanced understanding of what polygamy could look like in practice. Maybe we'll have a society where polygamy is seen as a viable and healthy option for some people, and not just a relic of the past or a tool for exploitation.\nFallingSnowAngel: I suppose we'll just have to wait and see. But in the meantime, I think it's important for us to keep having these conversations and critically examining the implications of polygamy. Maybe we'll come up with some innovative solutions that address the concerns you've raised, and create a more equitable and just society for all.\nAs we continue to discuss and debate the topic of polygamy, it's clear that there are many complex and nuanced issues at play. While some people may see polygamy as a viable option for some individuals, others may view it as a system that perpetuates power imbalances and exploitation. Ultimately, the decision to enter into a polygamous relationship should be a personal one, made with full knowledge of the potential consequences and implications.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No.\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

CMV! :)\nFallingSnowAngel: Are we talking about polygamy in an ideal world, as an abstract, or polygamy in a world where wealthy men frequently compete to accumulate as many beautiful wives as possible, replacing them as needed, while their sons are treated\n\nText continuation:\nas disposable and unwanted pieces of trash? \nBecause polygamy is beautiful, until you bring all that ugliness into it. \nimjusthereforkitties: I don't see where the comment about the fate of the sons comes from. Surely they'd still have loving mothers even if their father was busy with business or a bunch of other children? But then there exist traditionally married families with children in the double figures or uncaring, work-driven fathers so this isn't the fault of polygamy. \nI really don't see how anything you've said is worse than the current state of marriage in which wealthy men have wives and several mistresses. Any why is that morally wrong anyway? The women live in splendor and the man gets his sexy time. They're all consenting adults here.\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: One man having 20 wives creates a surplus of male children that must be driven off to preserve the status quo, this is how polygamy is practiced in the real world. \nimjusthereforkitties: Contraception?\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: How would contraception help? They want numerous children, they don't want men to compete for wives with. \nimjusthereforkitties: Oh i thought the kids would be accidents if they were being driven away upon maturation. Well that sucks, though i still think polygamy would go down differently in western culture...but i guess this is what FallingSnowAngel said about polygamy's difference as an abstract and an ideal.\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: Polygamy is in like this in America in fundamentalist morman communities, that might not be the West you were thinking of but it's hard to think of a religion more American. The problem with polygamy is that it can't be a relationship between equals. The man makes the decisions and the women have to live with it. I don't have a problem with polyamory, but a system where a man can have an unlimited number of wives to use and control does seem morally and ethically suspect. If people have freedom to choose, education, opportunities it doesn't seem like a relationship that is based on women being property would organically arise. While monogamy has it's roots in property exchange, we have dating today, marriage is based on friendship, love, affection, commitment regardless of gender and not the economic and political institution it was originally created to be. Egalitarian group marriage is a whole nother can of worms, nothing wrong with having a poly family and it obviously works for some but I can't begin to imagine how to address the issue legislatively. If marriage is about love and building a life and creating a family (not necessarily children) then we should be able to find a way, but we certainly haven't gotten there yet.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

And in the middle, a brother and sister are separated by these two pulls.\nEdit: typos\n\nText continuation:\nAs the debate continues, it's essential to acknowledge the complex emotions and motivations involved. The Texan family, driven by a desire to provide a loving home, may not fully comprehend the cultural significance of preserving Native American heritage. Conversely, the Native American tribe, seeking to protect their children's cultural identity, may not fully grasp the emotional needs of the children themselves. Caught in the middle are the children, who are forced to navigate two vastly different worlds, torn between the comfort and security of their adoptive family and the cultural connection to their biological heritage.\nThe issue at hand is not solely about adoption or cultural preservation, but about the fundamental right of children to know and connect with their roots. The question remains: what is the best way to ensure that Native American children are able to grow up with a strong sense of identity and cultural connection? Should it be through adoption by a loving family, or through preservation of their cultural heritage within their own community?\nAs the debate rages on, it's crucial to remember that the fate of these children is not just a matter of legal or cultural significance, but also a matter of human compassion and empathy. The Texan family, the Native American tribe, and the children themselves all deserve our understanding, respect, and support.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

And yet that solution doesn't even seem to be on the table. \nTo say \"I have more money for you, so I can do a better job bringing up your children, so I should be able to take them\" is imperialism at its worst.

Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, pictured late last month during a visit to France. The attack happened while the plane was about to take off from Mogadishu's airport Sunday around 11 a.m. local time, spokesman Hussien Mohammed Huubsireb said. \"Al-Shaabab has actually tried to harm to president, but thank God nobody was hurt,\" Huubsireb said. Al-Shaabab is an Islamic militia that is trying to seize control of Somalia. It is a splinter group of the Islamic Courts Union, which ousted Somalia's transitional government in 2006. The ICU was deposed in December of that year following Ethiopia's military invasion. Bloody battles between Al-Shaabab and the Ethiopian-backed government forces in Mogadishu have forced residents to flee the capital. More than 40,000 displaced civilians have taken shelter in dozens of makeshift settlements west of Mogadishu, described by the United Nations as \"precarious conditions.\" Sunday's mortar attack is the second assassination attempt on Ahmed. The president survived a car bombing in September 2006 outside Somalia's parliament in Baidoa that killed at least eight others. Somalia's Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi has been more frequently targeted by the Islamic insurgents seeking to destabilize the government. Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. Somalia's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital, with the help of the better-equipped Ethiopian forces. But the presence of the Ethiopians has united various Islamic militant groups in Somalia, including Al-Shaabab, who are trying to oust the Ethiopian forces and gain control of Mogadishu.

Starting from basic mechanics principles, we calculate the work that the diver must provide through propulsion to counterbalance the action of drag, the buoyant force and weight during immersion. Compared to those in previous studies, the model presented here accurately analyses breath-hold divers which alternate active swimming with prolonged glides during the dive (as is the case in mammals). The energy cost of the dive is strongly dependent on these prolonged gliding phases. Here we investigate the length and impacts on energy cost of these glides with respect to the diver characteristics, and compare them with those observed in different breath-hold diving species. Taking into account the basal metabolic rate\n\nText continuation:\n, we also examine the effects of dive duration, body size, and swimming speed on the energy expenditure of the diver.\nOur model shows that the energy cost of the dive is directly proportional to the length of the gliding phase, and inversely proportional to the swimming speed. This suggests that divers that are able to maintain a higher swimming speed during the glide phase will expend less energy overall. Additionally, our results indicate that larger divers will expend more energy due to their increased body mass, which will also affect their buoyancy and drag during the dive.\nWe also find that the energy cost of the dive is influenced by the basal metabolic rate of the diver, with higher metabolic rates resulting in increased energy expenditure. This is likely due to the increased energy requirements for maintenance of bodily functions, such as heart rate and breathing, during the dive. Furthermore, our model suggests that the dive duration has a significant impact on the energy cost, with longer dives resulting in increased energy expenditure due to the cumulative effects of prolonged gliding phases.\nIn comparison to other breath-hold diving species, our results suggest that humans are relatively efficient divers, with a lower energy cost per unit distance traveled compared to some other mammals. However, this may be due to the fact that humans are able to maintain a relatively high swimming speed during the glide phase, which offsets the increased energy expenditure due to their larger body size.\nOverall, our model provides a more accurate representation of the energy cost of breath-hold diving, taking into account the complexities of the dive profile and the physiological characteristics of the diver. This has important implications for our understanding of the energetics of diving in both humans and other breath-hold diving species, and may be used to inform the development of more efficient diving techniques and equipment.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n\nText start", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Starting from basic mechanics principles, we calculate the work that the diver must provide through propulsion to counterbalance the action of drag, the buoyant force and weight during immersion. Compared to those in previous studies, the model presented here accurately analyses breath-hold divers which alternate active swimming with prolonged glides during the dive (as is the case in mammals). The energy cost of the dive is strongly dependent on these prolonged gliding phases. Here we investigate the length and impacts on energy cost of these glides with respect to the diver characteristics, and compare them with those observed in different breath-hold diving species. Taking into account the basal metabolic rate\n\nText continuation:\nand chemical energy to propulsion transformation efficiency, we calculate optimal swim velocity and the corresponding total energy cost (including metabolic rate) and compare them with observations. Energy cost is minimised when the diver passes through neutral buoyancy conditions during the dive. This generally implies the presence of prolonged gliding phases in both ascent and descent, where the buoyancy (varying with depth) is best used against the drag, reducing energy cost. This is in agreement with past results (Miller et al., 2012; Sato et al., 2013) where, when the buoyant force is considered constant during the dive, the energy cost was minimised for neutral buoyancy. In particular, our model confirms the good physical adaption of dolphins for diving, compared to other breath-hold diving species which are mostly positively buoyant (penguins for example). The presence of prolonged glides implies a non-trivial dependency of optimal speed on maximal depth of the dive. This extends previous findings (Sato et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2011) which found no dependency of optimal speed on dive depth for particular conditions. The energy cost of the dive can be further diminished by reducing the volume of gas-filled body parts in divers close to neutral buoyancy. This provides a possible additional explanation for the observed exhalation of air before diving in phocid seals to minimise dive energy cost. Until now the only explanation for this phenomenon has been a reduction in the risk of decompression sickness.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The use of computational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single ventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of pacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the biomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing in clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In practice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each other's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD) the main steps involved in performing\n\nText continuation:\ncomputational simulations.\nThe first step is to define the problem and identify the specific clinical question being addressed. This requires a thorough understanding of the patient's anatomy and physiology, as well as the relevant clinical data. Next, the computational model is developed, which involves creating a digital representation of the patient's heart and blood vessels. This is typically done using specialized software and involves a range of techniques, including finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics.\nOnce the model is developed, it can be used to simulate various scenarios and predict the outcomes of different treatments. This allows clinicians to test different approaches and make informed decisions about the best course of action. The simulations can also be used to identify potential complications and develop strategies for mitigating them.\nIn addition to its clinical applications, computational simulation can also be used to advance our understanding of the underlying biology of congenital heart disease. For example, simulations can be used to study the effects of genetic mutations on heart development and function, or to investigate the role of environmental factors in the development of CHD.\nOverall, the use of computational simulation in the study of congenital heart disease has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach diagnosis and treatment. By providing a powerful tool for predicting outcomes and identifying potential complications, simulations can help clinicians make more informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n\nText start", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".

This paper is intended to facilitate this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD) the main steps involved in performing\n\nText continuation:\ncomputational simulation-from the selection of an appropriate clinical question/problem to understanding the computational results, and all of the \"black boxes\" in between. We examine the current state of the art and areas in need of continued development. For example, medical image-based model-building software has been developed based on numerous different methods. However, none of them can be used to construct a model with a simple \"click of a button\". The creation of a faithful, representative anatomic model, especially in pediatric subjects, often requires skilled manual intervention. In addition, information from a second imaging modality is often required to facilitate this process. We describe the technical aspects of model building, provide a definition of some of the most commonly used terms and techniques (e.g. meshes, mesh convergence, Navier-Stokes equations, and boundary conditions), and the assumptions used in running the simulations. Particular attention is paid to the assignment of boundary conditions as this point is of critical importance in the current areas of research within the realm of congenital heart disease. Finally, examples are provided demonstrating how computer simulations can provide an opportunity to \"acquire\" data currently unobtainable by other modalities, with essentially no risk to patients. To illustrate these points, novel simulation examples of virtual Fontan conversion (from preoperative data to predicted postoperative state) and outcomes of different surgical designs are presented. The need for validation of the currently employed techniques and predicted results are required and the methods remain in their infancy. While the daily application of these technologies to patient-specific clinical scenarios likely remains years away, the ever increasing interest in this area among both clinicians and engineers makes its eventual use far more likely than ever before and, some could argue, only a matter of [computing] time.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ":"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

We analyze the effects of bonding type, molecular orientation, and geometry relaxation on the electronic properties and charge and spin transport across the single-molecule junction. We consider nine interface geometries leading to five bonding mechanisms and two molecular orientations: (i) Au-C bonding, (ii) Au-Au bonding, (iii) Au-S bonding, (iv) Au-H bonding, and (v) physisorption via van der Waals forces. The two molecular orientations of Mn$_{12}$ correspond to the magnetic easy axis of the molecule aligned perpendicular [hereafter denoted as orientation (1)] or parallel\n\nText continuation:\nto the Au(111) surface [orientation (2)]. In both cases, the Mn$_{12}$ molecule is centered above the Au(111) surface, with its magnetic axis perpendicular to the surface.\nThe electronic properties of the single-molecule junction are characterized by the transmission coefficient, which is calculated using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The transmission coefficient is a measure of the probability of an electron being transmitted from one electrode to the other through the molecule. We find that the transmission coefficient is strongly dependent on the bonding type, molecular orientation, and geometry relaxation. For example, the Au-C bonding mechanism leads to a higher transmission coefficient compared to the Au-Au bonding mechanism, while the Au-S bonding mechanism results in a lower transmission coefficient.\nThe spin transport properties of the single-molecule junction are characterized by the spin transmission coefficient, which is calculated using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The spin transmission coefficient is a measure of the probability of a spin-polarized electron being transmitted from one electrode to the other through the molecule. We find that the spin transmission coefficient is also strongly dependent on the bonding type, molecular orientation, and geometry relaxation. For example, the Au-C bonding mechanism leads to a higher spin transmission coefficient compared to the Au-Au bonding mechanism, while the Au-S bonding mechanism results in a lower spin transmission coefficient.\nIn addition to the electronic and spin transport properties, we also analyze the effects of geometry relaxation on the single-molecule junction. We find that the geometry relaxation leads to a significant change in the electronic properties of the junction, particularly in the case of the Au-C bonding mechanism. The geometry relaxation results in a reduction of the transmission coefficient and a shift of the Fermi level of the junction.\nOverall, our results show that the bonding type, molecular orientation, and geometry relaxation have a significant impact on the electronic and spin transport properties of the single-molecule magnet Mn$_{12}$ bridged between Au(111) electrodes. The results provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of single-molecule junctions for spin-based electronic devices.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

We analyze the effects of bonding type, molecular orientation, and geometry relaxation on the electronic properties and charge and spin transport across the single-molecule junction. We consider nine interface geometries leading to five bonding mechanisms and two molecular orientations: (i) Au-C bonding, (ii) Au-Au bonding, (iii) Au-S bonding, (iv) Au-H bonding, and (v) physisorption via van der Waals forces. The two molecular orientations of Mn$_{12}$ correspond to the magnetic easy axis of the molecule aligned perpendicular [hereafter denoted as orientation (1)] or parallel\n\nText continuation:\n[orientation (2)] to the direction of electron transport. We find that the electron transport is carried by the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level in all the cases that we have simulated. Relaxation of the junction geometries mainly shifts the relevant occupied molecular levels toward the Fermi energy as well as slightly reduces the broadening of the LUMO level. As a result, the current slightly decreases at low bias voltage. Our calculations also show that placing the molecule in the orientation (1) broadens the LUMO level much more than in the orientation (2), due to the internal structure of the Mn$_{12}$. Consequently, junctions with the former orientation yield a higher current than those with the latter. Among all of the bonding types considered, the Au-C bonding gives rise to the highest current (about one order of magnitude higher than the Au-S bonding), for a given distance between the electrodes. The current through the junction with other bonding types decreases in the order of Au-Au, Au-S, and Au-H. Importantly, the spin-filtering effect in all the nine geometries stays robust and their ratios of the majority-spin to the minority-spin transmission coefficients are in the range of 10$^3$ to 10$^8$. The general trend in transport among the different bonding types and molecular orientations obtained from this study may be applied to other single-molecular magnets.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The dishwasher also has the black and white but they're much thinner and frayed.  I was concerned that maybe the power coming from the house is too high in watts, or however its measured.  No idea how I would know. Its a 40 yr old house and the dishwasher is at least 30 yrs old, maybe more. Am I good to just connect them?  Or does rewiring need to take place?\nhttp://i.imgur.com/f29JO5h.jpg, this is the black one coming from the wall\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rUEnn9R.jpg this is the one from the dishwasher\nI don't recall if the wires from the old dishwasher\n\nText continuation:\nwere similar, sorry.\nI'll be turning off the power from the circuit breaker incase anyone was going to mention I do that first.  \nHopefully I can get this done for them tonite.  \ndfoley1313: What do you mean you have wires coming from the wall? The new dishwasher should have came with a new cord or you need to get one. Usually the dishwasher plugs into the same outlet as the garbage disposal would but one outlet is controlled by a switch meaning one outlet is always hot while the other is controlled by the switch. If there is only 1 hot coming do not worry about power or is still at 120ac \nbrock_lee: Where do you live?  In most of America the dishwasher is hard-wired and never comes with a plug-in cord. In fact, it is usually on a dedicated circuit which is code.\nghostfacr: This is correct and proper.  There is a junction box at the bottom front of like, every dishwasher.\ndfoley1313: That isn't code. Code is having a GFCI with dedicated circuit. You can use a pig tail to connect to the outlet under the sink, but yes you can connect hardwired. But again why do that, it is not a code issue and it is more of a pain in the ass to do so. Also Norther Cali \ngottapoop: Code in Canada doesn't require GFCI. Most dishwashers are hardwired here so you'd have to buy an expensive GFCI breaker. You sure about that code? Our codes are very similar\ndfoley1313: Yes gfci breaker is needed sorry forgot to put \"breaker\" in.  We always run 12/3 one goes to the top which stays hot then we break the tab run the other hot to the switch back to the bottom outlet and you have a outlet that has both a 20amp circuit. There is no problem doing a pig tail on a appliance and plugging it into a outlet instead of just hardwiring it to the device. Again it is a little extra work but it makes installing it easier and is code. I have done a lot of remodels of kitchens and inspectors ALWAYS check for this. \ngottapoop: Ya I just did a little googling and saw that our codes are definitely different for dishwashers. We don't even have anything relating to specifically to dishwashers just that they are a known motor and heating load so they have to be on their own circuit. Most are hardwired luckily because if you put them on a receptacle they would have to be on an AFCI due to new code rules requiring all receptacles unless otherwise stated needing to be AFCI protected.\nDoes the receptacle you install for the dishwasher go on the counter top and you run the power cable up or do you install under the kitchen sink and do the split receptacle thing for future additions like garberators or undercab lighting?\ndfoley1313: Goes under the cabinet usually in the sink base. Never thought of using it for under cab lighting usually just the disposal. Using the 12/3 and the split receptacle is the easiest way to do it. Now most of the times we don't even run a switch for the garbage disposal we just have them both hot but on different home runs, but use a air gap switch for the garbage disposal mounted on the sink.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nI'm"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nI'm"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The Earl's parties were conveyed by coach from Wentworth Woodhouse to the station to join these trains which were known, and shown in railway publications as \"E.F.W.

The M.S.& L.R. issued a 'Royal Standard' to the station to be flown when royalty was included in the party.\nThe station was also host to other trains\n\nText continuation:\n, including those carrying dignitaries and high-ranking officials. The station's unique history and significance were reflected in its architecture, with a distinctive clock tower and ornate waiting rooms. Over the years, the station played host to numerous events, including the annual St. Leger festival, which drew visitors from all over the country.\nAs the years went by, the station continued to serve the Earl's parties and other special trains, but its usage gradually declined. By the mid-20th century, the station was largely abandoned, and its once-grand buildings fell into disrepair.

The properties are distinct, and I think that's what's giving us a bit of a reprieve\nBut I digress, back to silicone in the kitchen. I've been using it for everything from spatulas to storage containers, and it's been a game-changer. The non-stick surface is a dream for cooking and cleaning, and it's so easy to sterilize. I've even started using it for making homemade pasta, and it's been a revelation. The way it glides across the countertop, effortlessly shaping and cutting the dough... it's like magic.\nOf course, there are some downsides to silicone. For one, it can be a bit of a pain to clean when it's caked on with food residue. And some people have reported that it can impart a slightly chemical taste to certain foods. But overall, I think the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.\nAnd who knows, maybe in 50 years we'll look back on silicone the way we do on vinyl records or VHS tapes \u2013 a relic of a bygone era.

There are a lot of overlaps in specific applications too so that just makes things even more vague. \nVulcanised Rubber is a good example, I think.\nraznov1: &gt;with the former more often far more complex emulsions of these chains with water, proteins and other complex organics like sugars.\nNot really - silicone \"rubber\" is really easy, for example.\n&gt;Chemically, vaguely similar, but in practice very different material groups.

Hillary Clinton said Sunday some people are using her controversial reference to Robert F. Kennedy's assassination to suggest that she meant something \"completely unthinkable.\" Sen. Hillary Clinton says her supporters urge her to stay in the race until it is over. Her campaign also accused the rival Obama campaign of \"inflaming\" the situation and purposely taking her words out of context. But the Obama campaign said it was not trying to \"stir the issue up.\" In an editorial in the New York Daily News, the Democratic presidential hopeful also acknowledged her dwindling chances of winning the nomination, saying she is aware of \"the odds\" against her. Headlined \"Hillary: Why I continue to run,\" the editorial began with an explanation of her reference to the assassination when she was speaking to the Argus Leader newspaper in South Dakota. She said she was pointing out that presidential primary campaigns have continued into June. \"Almost immediately, some took my comments entirely out of context and interpreted them to mean something completely different -- and completely unthinkable,\" she wrote.  Watch Hillary's camp insist the remark had nothing to do with Obama \u00bb . Clinton said the newspaper's editor and Bobby Kennedy Jr. issued statements arguing that was the meaning of her remark. No other member of the Kennedy family has issued a public statement on the matter. \"I realize that any reference to that traumatic moment for our nation can be deeply painful -- particularly for members of the Kennedy family, who have been in my heart and prayers over this past week,\" she said, in a reference to Sen. Edward Kennedy's diagnosis with brain cancer. \"And I expressed regret right away for any pain I caused. \"But I was deeply dismayed and disturbed that my comment would be construed in a way that flies in the face of everything I stand for -- and everything I am fighting for in this election.\" Some people -- particularly a number of bloggers -- have suggested she was imagining the possibility that Sen. Barack Obama, the likely nominee, could be assassinated. After Clinton's initial remarks to the newspaper were reported, the Obama campaign issued a statement saying the comment \"was unfortunate and has no place in this campaign.\" But Obama himself later said, \"I don't think that Senator Clinton intended anything by it,\" and that \"we should put it behind us.\" Clinton campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe, in an interview Sunday, criticized the Obama campaign's first move. \"It's unfortunate -- a hyped-up press over Memorial Day weekend, the Obama campaign inflaming it, tried to take these words out of context,\" he told \"Fox News Sunday.\" Asked about the remark by Obama himself, McAuliffe responded, \"That's great, but Friday they were all part of this process. The press secretary came out and attacked Senator Clinton and got it going so the story would be around for three days.\" Howard Wolfson, a Clinton adviser, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that the Obama campaign's first statement critical of Clinton was \"unfortunate.\" But Obama's chief strategist David Axelrod told ABC's \"This Week\" that \"we take her at her word,\" and he added, \"We're beyond that issue now, so certainly we're not trying to stir the issue up.\" The program's host, George Stephanopoulos, noted that a member of Obama's staff sent to the media Saturday a \"searing commentary\" by MSNBC's Keith Olbermann slamming Clinton for her remark. \"Mr. Olbermann did his commentary and he had his opinion,\" Axelrod responded, adding, \"As far as we're concerned, this issue is done.\" On another front, Axelrod slammed Clinton for suggesting she leads Obama in the popular vote. Clinton has been making that argument, based on figures that include Florida and Michigan, even though Obama took his name off the ballot in Michigan and neither candidate campaigned in Florida. The Democratic Party discounted both states' primaries before they took place. \"It would take some very tortured math and tortured logic to say that she's ahead in the popular vote,\" Axelrod told ABC. He added, \"This isn't 'American Idol,' OK? This is a nominating process. We have rules. We elect delegates state by state.\" In her column, Clinton said she believes she can still \"win on the merits.\" \"I am not unaware of the challenges or the odds of my securing the nomination -- but this race remains extraordinarily close, and hundreds of thousands of people in upcoming primaries are still waiting to vote,\" she wrote. She added that her parents \"did not raise me to be a quitter -- and too many people still come up to me at my events, grip my arm and urge me not to walk away before this contest is over.\" She also said she is running \"because I believe staying in this race will help unite the Democratic Party. I believe that if Senator Obama and I both make our case -- and all Democrats have the chance to make their voices heard -- in the end, everyone will be more likely to rally around the nominee.\" She repeated her vow to campaign for Obama if he gets the nomination, and wrote, \"No matter what happens in this primary, I am committed to unifying this party.\" Obama was in Middleton, Connecticut, where he was standing in for the ailing Edward Kennedy who was scheduled to deliver the commencement at Wesleyan University.  Watch Obama tell graduates they have an obligation \u00bb . The theme of Obama's speech was service, and the senator asked graduates to volunteer their time at home and abroad to fight poverty, preserve peace and protect the environment . \"But I hope you'll remember, during those times of doubt and frustration, that there is nothing naive about your impulse to change this world,\" he said. \"Because all it takes is one act of service -- one blow against injustice -- to send forth that tiny ripple of hope that Robert Kennedy spoke of.\"\n\nSummary:\nSen.

No other member of the Kennedy family has issued a public statement on the matter. \"I realize that any reference to that traumatic moment for our nation can be deeply painful -- particularly for members of the Kennedy family, who have been in my heart and prayers over this past week,\" she said, in a reference to Sen. Edward Kennedy's diagnosis with brain cancer. \"And I expressed regret right away for any pain I caused. \"But I was deeply dismayed and disturbed that my comment would be construed in a way that flies in the face of everything I stand for -- and everything I am fighting for in this election.\" Some people -- particularly a number of bloggers -- have suggested she was imagining the possibility that Sen. Barack Obama, the likely nominee, could be assassinated. After Clinton's initial remarks to the newspaper were reported, the Obama campaign issued a statement saying the comment \"was unfortunate and has no place in this campaign.\" But Obama himself later said, \"I don't think that Senator Clinton intended anything by it,\" and that \"we should put it behind us.\" Clinton campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe, in an interview Sunday, criticized the Obama campaign's first move. \"It's unfortunate -- a hyped-up press over Memorial Day weekend, the Obama campaign inflaming it, tried to take these words out of context,\" he told \"Fox News Sunday.\" Asked about the remark by Obama himself, McAuliffe responded, \"That's great, but Friday they were all part of this process. The press secretary came out and attacked Senator Clinton and got it going so the story would be around for three days.\" Howard Wolfson, a Clinton adviser, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that the Obama campaign's first statement critical of Clinton was \"unfortunate.\" But Obama's chief strategist David Axelrod told ABC's \"This Week\" that \"we take her at her word,\" and he added, \"We're beyond that issue now, so certainly we're not trying to stir the issue up.\" The program's host, George Stephanopoulos, noted that a member of Obama's staff sent to the media Saturday a \"searing commentary\" by MSNBC's Keith Olbermann slamming Clinton for her remark. \"Mr. Olbermann did his commentary and he had his opinion,\" Axelrod responded, adding, \"As far as we're concerned, this issue is done.\" On another front, Axelrod slammed Clinton for suggesting she leads Obama in the popular vote. Clinton has been making that argument, based on figures that include Florida and Michigan, even though Obama took his name off the ballot in Michigan and neither candidate campaigned in Florida. The Democratic Party discounted both states' primaries before they took place. \"It would take some very tortured math and tortured logic to say that she's ahead in the popular vote,\" Axelrod told ABC. He added, \"This isn't 'American Idol,' OK? This is a nominating process. We have rules. We elect delegates state by state.\" In her column, Clinton said she believes she can still \"win on the merits.\" \"I am not unaware of the challenges or the odds of my securing the nomination -- but this race remains extraordinarily close, and hundreds of thousands of people in upcoming primaries are still waiting to vote,\" she wrote. She added that her parents \"did not raise me to be a quitter -- and too many people still come up to me at my events, grip my arm and urge me not to walk away before this contest is over.\" She also said she is running \"because I believe staying in this race will help unite the Democratic Party. I believe that if Senator Obama and I both make our case -- and all Democrats have the chance to make their voices heard -- in the end, everyone will be more likely to rally around the nominee.\" She repeated her vow to campaign for Obama if he gets the nomination, and wrote, \"No matter what happens in this primary, I am committed to unifying this party.\" Obama was in Middleton, Connecticut, where he was standing in for the ailing Edward Kennedy who was scheduled to deliver the commencement at Wesleyan University.  Watch Obama tell graduates they have an obligation \u00bb . The theme of Obama's speech was service, and the senator asked graduates to volunteer their time at home and abroad to fight poverty, preserve peace and protect the environment . \"But I hope you'll remember, during those times of doubt and frustration, that there is nothing naive about your impulse to change this world,\" he said. \"Because all it takes is one act of service -- one blow against injustice -- to send forth that tiny ripple of hope that Robert Kennedy spoke of.\"\n\nSummary:\nBarack Obama denounces remark, then says to \"put it behind us\"\nHillary Clinton's camp says Obama intentionally stoking controversy\nClinton says in editorial she knows the odds are against her getting nomination\nObama mentions Robert Kennedy in imploring Wesleyan graduates to volunteer\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The train, inaugurated in 1946, originally ran from Cincinnati, Ohio, to New Orleans, Louisiana, via Louisville, Nashville, Birmingham, Montgomery and Mobile and later via a connection at Bowling Green, Kentucky, to Memphis, Tennessee. A connection to Chicago was provided by the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad.\nThe Humming Bird had separate sections in the north and the south. The main northern part originated in Cincinnati; other sections (of the L&N's Georgian) originated in St. Louis and from Chicago. These sections linked with the main part of the train in Nashville. At Bowling Green, Kentucky, a southwest-bound section broke off, bound for Memphis; whereas the main southern route continued south to\n\nText continuation:\nMobile, Alabama, where it connected with the Gulf Coast Limited, a train operated by the Illinois Central Railroad.\nThe Humming Bird was known for its luxurious accommodations, including sleeping cars, dining cars, and observation cars. The train featured a distinctive silver and blue color scheme, with a logo featuring a hummingbird, which was a symbol of the railroad. The train was also famous for its on-board amenities, including fine dining, entertainment, and comfortable sleeping quarters.\nAs the years went by, the Humming Bird continued to operate, with occasional changes to its route and schedule. In the 1960s, the train was modified to include air-conditioned cars, and in the 1970s, it was upgraded to include diesel locomotives. Despite these changes, the Humming Bird remained a popular choice for travelers, particularly those looking for a comfortable and convenient way to travel between the Midwest and the Gulf Coast.\nIn the 1980s, the Humming Bird was merged with other trains operated by the L&N, and it was eventually discontinued in the 1990s. However, its legacy lives on, with many railroad enthusiasts still fondly remembering the train's luxurious accommodations and scenic route. Today, the Humming Bird is remembered as a symbol of the golden age of American rail travel, a time when trains were the primary mode of transportation and the railroad was a vital part of the country's infrastructure.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The train, inaugurated in 1946, originally ran from Cincinnati, Ohio, to New Orleans, Louisiana, via Louisville, Nashville, Birmingham, Montgomery and Mobile and later via a connection at Bowling Green, Kentucky, to Memphis, Tennessee. A connection to Chicago was provided by the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad.\nThe Humming Bird had separate sections in the north and the south. The main northern part originated in Cincinnati; other sections (of the L&N's Georgian) originated in St. Louis and from Chicago. These sections linked with the main part of the train in Nashville. At Bowling Green, Kentucky, a southwest-bound section broke off, bound for Memphis; whereas the main southern route continued south to\n\nText continuation:\nNashville and New Orleans. Also, en route to New Orleans, a connecting bus option in Flomaton, Alabama assisted with travel to Pensacola, Florida, while trains were used for the northbound trip.\nIn the mid-1950s, Train 5 departed Louisville at 10:05 pm for New Orleans. Train 6 was the northbound number.\nThe original equipment was part of a 28-car order of four train sets of lightweight stainless steel cars built in 1946 by ACF. Fourteen cars were assigned to the Humming Bird and fourteen to the Georgian. Many of those cars were removed from service in the late 1960s due to severe corrosion problems.\nThe L&N Railroad served the old Union Station in Memphis, until its closure on April 1, 1964. The railroad then used Central Station. Both L&N and Southern Railway were forced to reopen part of Union Station on December 1, 1966, and use it until March 30, 1968.\nThe Humming Bird was canceled on January 9, 1969. At that time, the L&N Railroad earned some unwanted publicity when it terminated the final run of the train en route southbound at Birmingham when a federal judge lifted the order keeping the train running after the Interstate Commerce Commission approved its permanent discontinuance. The passengers were then bused to their destinations.\nThe train inspired the song \"Hummingbird\" by country artist Ricky Skaggs and was mentioned in the song \"Southern Rains\" by country artist Mel Tillis.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Maybe because our generation was faced with clunky UI and everything was new so we always were looking at the next tech coming up.\nterminalmemelocity: Maybe because tech didn't just get handed to us\n\nText continuation:\nAs I read through the comments, I couldn't help but nod in agreement. The Xennial generation, born between the late 1970s and early 1980s, is indeed a unique breed. We grew up in a time when analog and digital coexisted, when cassette tapes and VHS players were the norm, but we also witnessed the dawn of the internet and mobile phones.\nAs a 38-year-old, I've had to navigate the complexities of explaining old people to young people, and vice versa. It's a delicate balance, one that requires a deep understanding of both the past and the present. But what's interesting is that, despite being part of the \"older\" generation, I've found myself more in touch with the latest internet trends and tech advancements than many of my younger friends.\nMaybe it's because our generation was forced to adapt to new technology at a slower pace. We didn't have the luxury of growing up with smartphones or social media; we had to learn to navigate the digital world through trial and error. And as a result, we developed a unique perspective on technology \u2013 one that's both nostalgic and forward-thinking.\ngraybuilder's comment about clunky UI resonated with me. Remember the early days of the internet, when websites were slow to load and graphics were pixelated? It was a frustrating experience, but it also forced us to be more resourceful and patient. We learned to appreciate the little things, like the thrill of discovering a new website or the satisfaction of finally figuring out how to use a new software.\nterminalmemelocity's comment about tech not being handed to us also struck a chord. We didn't have the luxury of being spoon-fed technology; we had to work for it. We had to learn to troubleshoot, to problem-solve, and to adapt to new situations. And as a result, we developed a deeper appreciation for the value of technology and the importance of continuous learning.\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I realize that being an Xennial has its advantages. We're not stuck in the past, but we're also not completely lost in the present. We have a unique perspective on technology, one that's rooted in both nostalgia and innovation. And as we navigate the complexities of the digital world, I believe that our generation will continue to play a vital role in shaping the future of technology.\nBut what does it mean to be an Xennial? Is it a badge of honor, a symbol of our unique experiences and perspectives? Or is it simply a label, a way to categorize and understand our place in the world? Whatever the answer may be, I believe that our generation has a lot to offer \u2013 and that our story is far from over.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Like you said if you're handed a phone, sure you can Instagram and Facebook but it doesn't mean you can set up a VCR\nIm_not_billy: I don't even know what a VCR is\nThatSquareChick: Video Cassette Recorder. You put big cartridges into these machines and they recorded whatever was on your tv screen. They used magnetic tape which degraded over time and use and often your tapes would go into the VCR and only back out trailing the brown/black tape hopelessly tangled and twisted. This killed the tape and whatever was on it. Since the Internet wasn\u2019t a thing, something recorded was maybe the only recording. Maybe you were the only one who taped 120 seconds of an Eek! The Cat episode where Sharky goes to therapy and it looks like he\u2019s on acid. Lots of shows got cancelled and never aired second times. Movies came out years after they premiered in theaters, pay tv channels would come unscrambled, cousin Becky\u2019s wedding, they all needed tapes and the VCR was the magical machine you hooked your TV to play and record them. Hand held recorders didn\u2019t even go straight from the recorder to the VCR either, you needed an adapter and not every VCR could play home recorded tapes. Sometimes the adapter ate the tape inside the cassettes too and therefore cousin Becky\u2019s wedding, where only one person could afford a camera, would be lost forever. Sometimes something would come on TV that was super important and a random tape would be grabbed to record it. Later on, you would horrifyingly find out that you accidentally taped over the wedding, birth or other important family event or, even worse, another taped thing that was your favorite or part of a series. You\u2019d forever have a tape where after the credits started to roll on Terminator you\u2019d see five minutes of cousin Becky in her wedding dress before it would jerk into the opening for He-Man.\nAh those were such chaotic times, where all digital information was fragile and fleeting. I kind of miss it.\nCrowlives: Yeah, but if you popped out the plastic tab, it wouldn\u2019t record over it.\nHowever, you could put a piece of tape over the missing tab to record on it again.\nbdlcalichef: BetaMax was the superior format\nNotMyHersheyBar: too expensive and actually physically heavy. it can't just be clear, it has to meet the market's needs.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The Schottky contact in the MIN structure helps to reduce the thermal resistance, allowing the solar cell to operate efficiently even in high-temperature environments. Additionally, the MIN structure's design is more scalable than traditional PIN structures, making it easier to manufacture and integrate into larger solar power systems. Overall, the MIN structure's improved efficiency, radiation resistance, and thermal stability make it an attractive option for future space-based solar power applications.\nIn conclusion, the MIN structure's design offers a promising solution for improving the efficiency and reliability of thin film solar cells.

With a simulated efficiency of 19.8%, the MIN structure performs better than the previously studied Schottky structure, while increasing its fabrication tolerance and thus functional reliability a. Owing to its good tolerance to radiations [1], its\n\nText continuation:\nhigh light absorption [2, 3] and its Indium-composition-tuned bandgap [4, 5], the Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) ternary alloy is a good candidate for high-efficiency-high-reliability solar cells able to operate in harsh environments. Unfortunately, InGaN p-doping is still a challenge, owing to InGaN residual n-doping [6], the lack of dedicated ac-ceptors [7] and the complex fabrication process itself [8, 9]. To these drawbacks can be added the uneasy fabrication of ohmic contacts [4] and the difficulty to grow the high-quality-high-Indium-content thin films [10] which would be needed to cover the whole solar spectrum. These drawbacks still prevent InGaN solar cells to be competitive with other well established III-V and silicon technologies [11]. In this letter, is proposed a new Metal-IN (MIN) InGaN solar cell structure where the InGaN p-doped layer is removed and replaced by a Schottky contact, lifting one of the above mentioned drawbacks. A set of realistic physical models based on actual measurements is used to simulate and optimize its behavior and performance using mathematically rigorous multi-criteria optimization methods, aiming to show that both efficiency and fabrication tolerances are better than the previously described simple InGaN Schottky solar cell [12].\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nMy answer"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases composed of 17 phonetic units (called on in Japanese, which are similar to syllables) in a 5, 7, 5 pattern; that include a kireji, or \"cutting word\"; and a kigo, or seasonal reference. Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified as senry\u016b.\nHaiku originated as an opening part of a larger Japanese poem called renga. These haiku written as an opening stanza were known as hokku and over time they began to be written as stand-alone poems. Haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.\nOriginally from Japan, haiku today are written by authors worldwide. Haiku in English and haiku in other languages have different styles and traditions while still incorporating aspects of the traditional haiku form. Non-Japanese haiku vary widely on how closely they follow traditional elements. Additionally, a minority movement within modern Japanese haiku (\u73fe\u4ee3\u4ff3\u53e5, gendai-haiku), supported by Ogiwara Seisensui and his disciples, has varied from the tradition of 17 on as well as taking nature as their subject.\nIn Japanese, haiku are traditionally printed as a single line, while haiku in English often appear as three lines, although variations exist. There are several other forms of Japanese poetry related to haiku, such as tanka, as well as other art forms that incorporate haiku, such as haibun and haiga.\n\nSummary:\nTraditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases composed of 17 phonetic units (called on in Japanese) in a 5, 7, 5 pattern; include a kireji, or \"cutting word\"; and a kigo, or seasonal reference.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\"", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

It can deal with general deterministic planning problems encoded in the propositional fragment of PDDL2.2, including advanced features like ADL conditions and effects and derived predicates (axioms). Like other well-known planners such as HSP and FF, Fast Downward is a progression planner, searching the space of world states of a planning task in the forward direction. However, unlike other PDDL planning systems, Fast Downward does not use the propositional PDDL representation of a planning task directly. Instead, the input is first translated into an alternative representation called multi-valued planning tasks, which makes many of the implicit constraints of a propositional planning task explicit. Exploiting this alternative\n\nText continuation:\nrepresentation, Fast Downward can handle planning problems that are difficult or impossible to solve using traditional propositional planning systems.\nOne of the key features of Fast Downward is its ability to handle planning problems with complex constraints and effects. This is achieved through the use of a sophisticated planning algorithm that can efficiently explore the search space of possible solutions. The algorithm is based on a combination of heuristic search and constraint propagation, which allows it to prune the search space and focus on the most promising regions.\nFast Downward has been successfully applied to a wide range of planning problems, including problems from robotics, logistics, and manufacturing. It has also been used to solve complex planning problems that involve multiple agents and uncertain environments. In addition, Fast Downward has been integrated with other planning systems and tools, such as planning languages and planning domains, to provide a comprehensive planning solution.\nOverall, Fast Downward is a powerful and flexible planning system that can handle a wide range of planning problems. Its ability to handle complex constraints and effects, combined with its efficient planning algorithm, make it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Exploiting this alternative\n\nText continuation:\nrepresentation, Fast Downward uses hierarchical decompositions of planning tasks for computing its heuristic function, called the causal graph heuristic, which is very different from traditional HSP-like heuristics based on ignoring negative interactions of operators. In this article, we give a full account of Fast Downwards approach to solving multi-valued planning tasks. We extend our earlier discussion of the causal graph heuristic to tasks involving axioms and conditional effects and present some novel techniques for search control that are used within Fast Downwards best-first search algorithm: preferred operators transfer the idea of helpful actions from local search to global best-first search, deferred evaluation of heuristic functions mitigates the negative effect of large branching factors on search performance, and multi-heuristic best-first search combines several heuristic evaluation functions within a single search algorithm in an orthogonal way. We also describe efficient data structures for fast state expansion (successor generators and axiom evaluators) and present a new non-heuristic search algorithm called focused iterative-broadening search, which utilizes the information encoded in causal graphs in a novel way. Fast Downward has proven remarkably successful: It won the \"classical (i.e., propositional, non-optimising) track of the 4th International Planning Competition at ICAPS 2004, following in the footsteps of planners such as FF and LPG. Our experiments show that it also performs very well on the benchmarks of the earlier planning competitions and provide some insights about the usefulness of the new search enhancements.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No.\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease\n\nText continuation:\ntypically display characteristic features such as ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and interstitial patterns, which are difficult to distinguish from other lung diseases. To address this challenge, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the images as either COVID-19 positive or negative. Our model is trained using a combination of transfer learning and fine-tuning, allowing it to learn from the pre-trained weights and adapt to the specific characteristics of the COVID-19 dataset. We evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and compare it to other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our model achieves a high level of accuracy and robustness, outperforming other methods in detecting COVID-19 patients from chest radiography images. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models in aiding the diagnosis of COVID-19, and highlights the importance of developing accurate and reliable diagnostic tools to combat this global health crisis.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ":"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " No.", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " No.", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " No.", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " No.", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " No.", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% ($\\pm$ 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates.

Should I not include him next time he seems lost? Is my friendliness doomed to be an invitation in his eyes? No one else in our course does anything to include him and I feel so bad about that. It's very unnatural to me to not include people like that but I guess I have to dismiss him more since he seems to interpret me wrong every time, right? I have told him very clearly that I am just being generally friendly and he is there everyday when I treat everybody with the same niceness as him. Should I say something more to him about this? \nI am going to meet him like multiple times a week for the next 4 years in our tiny ass class so I can't do anything crazy. I'm so stressed out about this. \nTL;DR a classic story: I was friendly to a loner guy in my class, he asked me out, I turned him down, he continues flirting. Should I be colder towards him because being a friendly seems to encourage him?\nnopiepoopi: I just wanted to say I think it could be worth bringing up with your other friends/classmates how they don\u2019t include him. \nJust discuss with them and ask them why they don\u2019t include him. Is there any reason? Are they genuinely just overlooking him? If so, maybe they can help you with including him too. I don\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t unless they\u2019re purposefully excluding him, and if that\u2019s the case, there should be a good reason as to why they\u2019re excluding him. \nIt would be nice for everyone to put in efforts to include others, is all.\nsplashysoup: That sounds good. Our class has a good vibe in general and everybody else is included at least to the extent that no one else is left outside groups like he is.

She had spent hours preparing for this moment, studying the behavior of the bees and learning how to identify the signs of a failing colony. It was a delicate process, but one that was crucial to the survival of the bees.\nSarah had always been fascinated by bees, and had spent countless hours watching them buzz around her garden. She loved the way they worked together, communicating through complex dances and pheromones, to build their intricate hives. But as she delved deeper into the world of beekeeping, she began to realize the importance of her role. Without beekeepers like her, the bees would be in danger of disappearing, taking with them the vital pollination services that they provided to the environment.\nAs she finished up her task, Sarah couldn't help but think about the many challenges that beekeepers faced. From pesticides and habitat loss, to climate change and disease, the list of threats to bee populations was long and daunting. But despite these challenges, Sarah remained optimistic. She knew that with the right tools and knowledge, beekeepers could make a real difference.\nAs she packed up her equipment and said goodbye to the bees, Sarah felt a sense of gratitude wash over her. She was grateful for the opportunity to make a difference, and for the chance to work with such incredible creatures. And as she walked away from the hive, she couldn't help but feel a sense of hope for the future. With dedicated beekeepers like herself, she knew that the bees would continue to thrive, and that the world would be a sweeter place because of it.\nBut as Sarah walked away from the hive, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She glanced over her shoulder, but there was nothing out of the ordinary. Just the usual bees buzzing around the hive, and the occasional bird flying overhead. But the feeling persisted, and Sarah couldn't help but wonder if she was being stalked by some unknown predator.\nAs she continued on her way, Sarah couldn't help but think about the many myths and legends surrounding bees. From the ancient Greeks, who believed that bees were the offspring of Zeus, to the modern-day fascination with bee venom therapy, the allure of bees was undeniable. And yet, despite their importance, bees were often misunderstood and feared. But Sarah knew that this was far from the truth. Bees were incredible creatures, capable of incredible feats of engineering and communication. And as she walked away from the hive, she felt a sense of pride and respect for these tiny, yet mighty, insects.\nAs the days went by, Sarah noticed that the bees were beginning to thrive. The hive was bustling with activity, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of honey. It was a sign that the colony was healthy and strong, and Sarah felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that she had played a role in their recovery. But as she watched the bees, she couldn't help but wonder what other secrets they held. What other mysteries lay hidden within the walls of the hive?\nAs she pondered this question, Sarah felt a sudden jolt of excitement. She had always been fascinated by the idea of bee communication, and she had spent countless hours studying the complex dances and pheromones that the bees used to communicate. But what if there was more to it than that? What if the bees were capable of something even more incredible?\nAs she stood there, lost in thought, Sarah felt a strange sensation wash over her. It was as if she was being drawn into the hive, pulled towards the very heart of the colony. And as she felt this sensation, she knew that she had to investigate further. She had to uncover the secrets that lay hidden within the walls of the hive.\nWith a sense of determination and excitement, Sarah made her way back to the hive. She knew that it would be a long and difficult journey, but she was ready for the challenge. For she knew that the secrets of the hive were worth uncovering, and that the journey would be worth it in the end.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Lock up important files in a cabinet. \nAlso keep drains stoppered and fix all leaky faucets. Doing these things drastically reduced the encounters I had. \nYou\u2019re welcome, I know what triggers me, and I didn\u2019t want to trigger you. :)\nKindheartednessNo167: When I bought our new home, we had a pest control friend pretreat our home for pests.

The book consists of seventy-five folios, twenty-two of which remain blank.\nIt was made for Sir Sea\u00e1n mac Oliver Bourke, 17th Mac William \u00cdochtar (d. 1580) of Mayo from 1571 to 1580. Believed to have been the product of his patronage, its production appears to have ceased upon his death, except for a few additions in 1584.\n\"It is, as far as we know, the last of the great family books written in Irish, but its text has remained rather bleak, the poems that were probably intended to fill the blank pages never having been copied\".\nThe text is of two\n\nText continuation:\nmain parts: the first part is a history of the de Burgo family, tracing their lineage back to the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century, and the second part is a collection of genealogical information about the family's members. The manuscript is written in Irish, with some Latin and English phrases scattered throughout. The text is accompanied by elaborate illustrations, including coats of arms, family crests, and other heraldic devices.\nDespite its historical significance, the Book of the de Burgos has not been widely studied or translated. This is likely due to the fact that the text is written in Irish, which is a language that is not widely spoken today. Additionally, the manuscript is written in a style that is difficult to decipher, with many of the words and phrases being written in a form of Irish that is no longer used. Nevertheless, the Book of the de Burgos remains an important artifact of Irish history and culture, and it continues to be studied by scholars and enthusiasts of the language and history of Ireland.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\"", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\"", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\" because I", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\" because I", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\" because I", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\" because I", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\" because I", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\""}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\"", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\" because I", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\"", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\"", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\"", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\"", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

What distinguishes the Book of the de Burgos from other late medieval Irish manuscripts is its visual style, with large pictures which are \"extremely crude and brutal in colour, but arresting by their originality and their vehemence. Movements are awkward but convincing... skies are red or yellow, dogs are green, there is a constant disproportion of the figures, but a sort of brutal integrity emanates from these images... gaudy and violently realistic.\"There are four scenes of the Passion, nine family portraits and a page on their coat of arms. Two poems inserted at the end of the book are praise-poems written by Tadhg Dall \u00d3 hUiginn and Ruaidhr\u00ed mac Domhnall \u00d3 hUiginn, for Sir Sea\u00e1n Bourke. The book ends with two legal deeds in Latin, dated 1584, between Walter Ciotach Burke (son of Sea\u00e1n) and the Barretts, who laid claim to possession of Belleek Castle.

But he said, no, the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store. If it's opened, other people won't believe it's new.\nUser 2: So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic.\nUser 1: Yes, it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with\n\nText continuation:\nnew electronics. It looked like it was never even opened.\nUser 2: And you believed him?\nUser 1: I was so excited to get a great deal. I didn't think twice about it.\nUser 2: You should have checked the box for any signs of tampering or damage. You could have even asked to see the camera before buying it.\nUser 1: I know, I know. I was blinded by the prospect of saving money. Now I'm out twenty bucks and I don't even have a working camera to show for it.\nUser 2: Well, at least you learned a valuable lesson. Always inspect the merchandise before buying, especially if it's a deal that seems too good to be true.\nUser 1: Yeah, you're right. I'll make sure to be more careful in the future. Thanks for listening to my story.\nUser 2: No problem, I'm just glad you're okay and didn't lose any more money.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap. That's easy. And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from. Maybe his friend works in an electronics store.

But can I ask, what's the typical workload like after the first two weeks? Will I be teaching more classes or will it remain the same?\nUser 1: It's usually a gradual increase in workload, but it depends on the school's needs and the students' schedules. We'll reassess your workload after the first two weeks and adjust accordingly. You'll also have the opportunity to provide feedback and make any necessary adjustments to your schedule.\nUser 2: Alright, that sounds reasonable. What kind of support can I expect from the school in terms of resources and materials?\nUser 1: We provide all the necessary materials and resources for your classes, including textbooks, handouts, and technology. You'll also have access to our staff development program, which offers training and workshops on teaching techniques and curriculum development.\nUser 2: That's great to hear. What about office hours? Will I have dedicated time to meet with students or will I need to make arrangements with the school?\nUser 1: You'll have dedicated office hours, which will be scheduled with the school's administration. You'll also have access to our student services department, which can assist with any student-related issues or concerns.\nUser 2: Okay, I think that covers everything.

Many programming languages offer a variety of container implementations in their standard libraries based on data structures offering different capabilities and performance characteristics. Inquiry: Choosing the *best* container for an application is not always straightforward, as performance characteristics can change drastically in different scenarios, and as real-world performance is not always correlated to theoretical complexity. Approach: We present Primrose, a language-agnostic tool for selecting the best performing valid container implementation from a set of container data types that satisfy *properties\n\nText continuation:\n*.\nPrimrose uses a combination of techniques, including benchmarking, profiling, and machine learning algorithms, to identify the most suitable container implementation for a given application. The tool is designed to be highly flexible, allowing developers to easily integrate it into their development workflow and to adapt it to their specific needs. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the performance characteristics of different container implementations, Primrose helps developers make informed decisions about which container to use in their application.\nOne of the key benefits of Primrose is its ability to consider a wide range of factors that can affect the performance of a container implementation. These factors include the size and complexity of the data being stored, the frequency and pattern of data access, and the specific requirements of the application. By taking these factors into account, Primrose can provide a more accurate and relevant assessment of the performance characteristics of different container implementations.\nIn addition to its technical capabilities, Primrose is also designed to be easy to use and integrate into a development workflow. The tool provides a simple and intuitive interface that allows developers to easily specify the requirements of their application and to view the results of the analysis. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily identify the most suitable container implementation for their application.\nOverall, Primrose is a powerful tool that can help developers make informed decisions about which container implementation to use in their application. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the performance characteristics of different container implementations, Primrose can help developers optimize the performance of their application and improve the overall efficiency of their development workflow.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n\nText start", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nMy answer"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No.\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Many programming languages offer a variety of container implementations in their standard libraries based on data structures offering different capabilities and performance characteristics. Inquiry: Choosing the *best* container for an application is not always straightforward, as performance characteristics can change drastically in different scenarios, and as real-world performance is not always correlated to theoretical complexity. Approach: We present Primrose, a language-agnostic tool for selecting the best performing valid container implementation from a set of container data types that satisfy *properties\n\nText continuation:\n* given by application developers. Primrose automatically selects the set of valid container implementations for which the *library specifications*, written by the developers of container libraries, satisfies the specified properties. Finally, Primrose ranks the valid library implementations based on their runtime performance. Knowledge: With Primrose, application developers can specify the expected behaviour of a container as a type refinement with *semantic properties*, e.g., if the container should only contain unique values (such as a `set`) or should satisfy the LIFO property of a `stack`. Semantic properties nicely complement *syntactic properties* (i.e., traits, interfaces, or type classes), together allowing developers to specify a container's programming interface *and* behaviour without committing to a concrete implementation. Grounding: We present our prototype implementation of Primrose that preprocesses annotated Rust code, selects valid container implementations and ranks them on their performance. The design of Primrose is, however, language-agnostic, and is easy to integrate into other programming languages that support container data types and traits, interfaces, or type classes. Our implementation encodes properties and library specifications into verification conditions in Rosette, an interface for SMT solvers, which determines the set of valid container implementations. We evaluate Primrose by specifying several container implementations, and measuring the time taken to select valid implementations for various combinations of properties with the solver. We automatically validate that container implementations conform to their library specifications via property-based testing. Importance: This work provides a novel approach to bring abstract modelling and specification of container types directly into the programmer's workflow. Instead of selecting concrete container implementations, application programmers can now work on the level of specification, merely stating the behaviours they require from their container types, and the best implementation can be selected automatically.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ":"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The issue isn't getting the speakers open as much as fixing the blown drivers themselves. I haven't heard many success stories of blown drivers being restored. The only spare speakers I have are little mid rangers from my car (one of them pops when turned too loud but otherwise works fine). I would send them to you but they're 2.75 inches in diameter which is a lot smaller than the ones you have. Normal superglue probably wouldn't adhere that well to the front grills because it's a little too thin. Thicker glue like hot glue or gorilla glue would be better for this situation.\n2LateImDead: I might be able to get some Gorilla glue if it's even fixable.  Probably isn't though, like you said.  Thanks for the offer of those speakers from your car.  I'm pretty sure they're actually about the size of these ones - I shone a light through the mesh to look inside and these things are like 90% casing, the speaker inside is fairly small.  I don't have any exact measurements, though.\nDo you have an estimate of how much it'd cost to mail them?  I live in Virginia.  I don't really have any money because my job sucks and I'm going through college and supporting myself, but I could skip paying my phone bill this month to cover shipping costs, potentially.  But I can't imagine they'd be huge, even shipping from Asia is normally no more than $10, if it's something reasonably small.\njonvon65: Honestly, don't worry about the shipping, I've got you covered. I'm testing them out right now and they're not half bad. Also they're just bare speakers and I'd like to put them in an enclosure of some sort before I ship them. What would you be hooking them up to?\n2LateImDead: I've got an old Sony amplifier that uses the basic black and red speaker wires to hook things up.  It's also got RCA (yellow-white-red, minus the yellow since it's just audio) outputs and inputs.  I've got an AUX-RCA adapter to input sound.  I've never used the RCA outputs but I'm under the impression that they'd work the same, so whatever is easiest for you.\nThanks a bunch, by the way.  I've been really stressed about not having any speakers.  I'll still need to find more, but getting back 2 when I lost 4 cuts the loss in half, which is a big help.  And even 2 is enough to get back to practicing and recording.  :)\nI'll send you a PM with my address.\njonvon65: Ahh ok, good, that makes it easy then! Of course, just letting you know beforehand that these speakers are good quality but they are rather small, you won't be pissing off the neighbors with them. That being said, just don't turn them up too loud and you should be fine. I'll start on building the enclosures tomorrow and hopefully I can get them shipped out to you sometime this week.

We all understand that paying taxes together as a collective gives far better value and purchasing power. You never notice paying for\n\nText continuation:\nhealthcare until you're in a situation where you really need it, and by then it's too late. It's like having a safety net that's always there, even when you're not thinking about it.\nMeanwhile, the revolutionary new treatment for diabetes is making headlines around the world. The treatment, developed by Harvard scientists, has shown incredible promise in clinical trials and is expected to be a game-changer for millions of people living with the disease. The treatment works by using a combination of gene editing and stem cell therapy to regenerate the pancreas and restore its ability to produce insulin.\nThe Australian team, led by Dr. Emma Smith, has made significant progress in their own research and is expected to release more details about their treatment soon. While the two treatments may differ in their approach, both have the potential to revolutionize the way we treat diabetes and improve the lives of those affected by the disease.\nAs the news of these breakthroughs spreads, many people are left wondering what this means for the future of diabetes treatment. Will these new treatments finally bring an end to the devastating effects of diabetes? Only time will tell, but for now, the hope is palpable.\nThe implications of these treatments go far beyond just the individuals affected by diabetes. They also have the potential to transform the way we approach healthcare as a whole. With the ability to regenerate organs and restore function, the possibilities are endless. Imagine a world where organs can be regrown and replaced, eliminating the need for transplants and the associated risks.\nOf course, there are still many challenges to overcome before these treatments become widely available. The cost of developing and implementing these treatments is significant, and there are many ethical considerations that must be taken into account. But the potential benefits are undeniable, and it's clear that we're on the cusp of a major breakthrough in the fight against diabetes.\nAs we wait with bated breath for the results of these treatments, it's clear that the future of healthcare is looking brighter than ever. With the help of scientists like Dr. Emma Smith and her team, we may finally be able to say goodbye to the devastating effects of diabetes and hello to a future where health and wellness are within reach for everyone.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Semantic clustering is one such technique for modularization of the system that relies on the informal semantics of the program, encoded in the vocabulary used in the source code. Treating the source code as a collection of tokens loses the semantic information embedded within the identifiers. We try to overcome this problem by introducing context models for source code identifiers to obtain a semantic kernel, which can be used for both deriving the topics that run through the system as well as their clustering. In the first model, we abstract an identifier to its type representation and build on this notion of context to construct contextual\n\nText continuation:\nrepresentations for each identifier. These representations are then used to compute the semantic similarity between identifiers, which is crucial for identifying the relationships between them.\nBy using contextual representations, we can capture the nuances of the program's semantics, such as the relationships between variables, functions, and classes. This allows us to identify the topics that are relevant to the program's functionality, and to cluster the identifiers based on their semantic similarity. In addition, we can also use these contextual representations to compute the semantic distance between identifiers, which can be used to identify the most similar or dissimilar identifiers in the program.\nOur approach has several advantages over traditional approaches to program comprehension. Firstly, it allows us to capture the semantic information embedded in the source code, which is essential for understanding the program's behavior and functionality. Secondly, it provides a more accurate and nuanced representation of the program's semantics, which can be used to identify the relationships between identifiers and to cluster them based on their semantic similarity. Finally, it can be used to compute the semantic distance between identifiers, which can be used to identify the most similar or dissimilar identifiers in the program.\nIn future work, we plan to extend our approach to include additional features, such as the program's control flow and data flow, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the program's behavior and functionality. We also plan to evaluate our approach on a larger scale, using a variety of programming languages and programming paradigms, to demonstrate its effectiveness and versatility.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n\nText start", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Semantic clustering is one such technique for modularization of the system that relies on the informal semantics of the program, encoded in the vocabulary used in the source code. Treating the source code as a collection of tokens loses the semantic information embedded within the identifiers. We try to overcome this problem by introducing context models for source code identifiers to obtain a semantic kernel, which can be used for both deriving the topics that run through the system as well as their clustering. In the first model, we abstract an identifier to its type representation and build on this notion of context to construct contextual\n\nText continuation:\nvector representation of the source code. The second notion of context is defined based on the flow of data between identifiers to represent a module as a dependency graph where the nodes correspond to identifiers and the edges represent the data dependencies between pairs of identifiers. We have applied our approach to 10 medium-sized open source Java projects, and show that by introducing contexts for identifiers, the quality of the modularization of the software systems is improved. Both of the context models give results that are superior to the plain vector representation of documents. In some cases, the authoritativeness of decompositions is improved by 67%. Furthermore, a more detailed evaluation of our approach on JEdit, an open source editor, demonstrates that inferred topics through performing topic analysis on the contextual representations are more meaningful compared to the plain representation of the documents. The proposed approach in introducing a context model for source code identifiers paves the way for building tools that support developers in program comprehension tasks such as application and domain concept location, software modularization and topic analysis.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Although there are many styles of motorcycles, they are loosely organized into 6 main categories.  These categories most closely align to the intended use of the vehicle.  There is your standard motorcycle, your more relaxed cruising motorcycle, the larger capacity and longer haul touring cycle, a racing more sportier sports cycle and then you have a off-road motorcycle often known as a dirtbike and lastly a dual-sport which is a motorcycle that can go both on and offroad.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"No\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"No\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"No\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"No\".

Given its large mass, its large radius cannot be explained by standard evolution models. Interestingly, the planet's parent star is an active, rapidly rotating solar-like star with a large fraction (7 to 20%) of spots. Aims: We want to provide constraints on the properties of the star-planet system and understand whether the planet's inferred large size may be due to a systematic error on the inferred parameters, and if not, how it may be explained. Methods: We combine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available spectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the system parameters. Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling (including spots and stellar activity\n\nText continuation:\n), which suggests that the planet's large size is not due to an error in the stellar parameters. We also investigate the possibility of a systematic error in the planetary parameters, but find that the planet's mass and radius are consistent with each other.\nDiscussion: Our results suggest that the planet's large size is real, and cannot be explained by standard evolution models. One possible explanation is that the planet has a high level of atmospheric escape, which could lead to a larger radius than expected. Another possibility is that the planet has a unique composition, such as a high metallicity or a high concentration of heavy elements, which could also contribute to its large size. Future studies could investigate these possibilities by analyzing the planet's atmospheric composition and properties.\nConclusion: Our study provides new insights into the properties of the CoRoT-2b system, and highlights the importance of considering the effects of stellar activity and spots on the analysis of exoplanet data. Our results also emphasize the need for further studies to understand the properties of this anomalously large exoplanet, and to determine whether it is a unique object or part of a larger population of similar planets.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Given its large mass, its large radius cannot be explained by standard evolution models. Interestingly, the planet's parent star is an active, rapidly rotating solar-like star with a large fraction (7 to 20%) of spots. Aims: We want to provide constraints on the properties of the star-planet system and understand whether the planet's inferred large size may be due to a systematic error on the inferred parameters, and if not, how it may be explained. Methods: We combine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available spectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the system parameters. Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling (including spots and stellar activity\n\nText continuation:\n) that would yield the required ~10% reduction in size for the star and thus the planet. Two classes of solutions are found: the usual main sequence solution for the star yields for the planet a mass of 3.67+/-0.13 Mjup, a radius of 1.55+/-0.03 Rjup for an age that is at least 130Ma, and should be less than 500Ma given the star's fast rotation and significant activity. We identify another class of solutions on the pre-main sequence, in which case the planet's mass is 3.45\\pm 0.27 Mjup, its radius is 1.50+/-0.06 Rjup for an age between 30 and 40 Ma. These extremely young solutions provide the simplest explanation for the planet's size which can then be matched by a simple contraction from an initially hot, expanded state, provided the atmospheric opacities are increased by a factor ~3 compared to usual assumptions for solar compositions atmospheres. Other solutions imply in any case that the present inflated radius of CoRoT-2b is transient and the result of an event that occurred less than 20 Ma ago: a giant impact with another Jupiter-mass planet, or interactions with another object in the system which caused a significant rise of the eccentricity followed by the rapid circularization of its orbit. Conclusions: Additional observations of CoRoT-2 that could help understanding this system include searches for infrared excess and the presence of a debris disk and searches for additional companions. The determination of a complete infrared lightcurve including both the primary and secondary transits would also be extremely valuable to constrain the planet's atmospheric properties and to determine the planet-to-star radius ratio in a manner less vulnerable to systematic errors due to stellar activity.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The PHP is a passive, wickless thermal device, whereby a two-phase fluid, forming liquid plugs and vapour slugs, moves with a pulsating or circulating motion inside a meandering tube or channel. The PHP may have a very broad range of geometries (flat, tubular, 3D structured), it can dissipate heat from large areas, and it can be suitable for high power applications with low/medium heat fluxes. PHP functioning is based on the capillary\n\nText continuation:\nforces acting between the fluid and the tube walls, which drive the fluid circulation and heat transfer. The PHP is a promising technology for various space and terrestrial applications, such as thermal management in electronic systems, cooling of high-power devices, and heat recovery in industrial processes.\nThe experimental setup on the ISS consisted of a PHP module, which was connected to a thermal interface and a temperature control unit. The PHP module was filled with a mixture of water and glycerin, which is a commonly used working fluid for PHPs due to its high boiling point and low viscosity. The experiment was designed to investigate the performance of the PHP under various operating conditions, including different heat loads, fluid flow rates, and tube geometries. The experimental data was collected using a combination of sensors and cameras, which provided information on the fluid flow, temperature, and pressure inside the PHP.\nThe numerical code used to simulate the PHP experiment was developed using a commercial software package, which was modified to include the specific features of the PHP device. The code was validated by comparing the simulation results with the experimental data, and it was found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The code was then used to investigate the performance of the PHP under various operating conditions, including different heat loads, fluid flow rates, and tube geometries. The results of the simulation showed that the PHP was able to dissipate heat efficiently, even under high power conditions, and that the device was able to maintain a stable operating temperature.\nThe experimental results and simulation results were used to validate the numerical code and to investigate the performance of the PHP under various operating conditions. The results showed that the PHP was able to dissipate heat efficiently, even under high power conditions, and that the device was able to maintain a stable operating temperature. The results also showed that the PHP was able to operate in a wide range of temperatures, from -20\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C, and that the device was able to dissipate heat from large areas.\nIn conclusion, the experimental results and simulation results obtained during the PHP experiment on the ISS demonstrate the potential of Pulsating Heat Pipes for various space and terrestrial applications. The results show that the PHP is a promising technology for thermal management in electronic systems, cooling of high-power devices, and heat recovery in industrial processes. Further research is needed to fully understand the behavior of the PHP and to optimize its performance under various operating conditions.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n\nI have", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The PHP may have a very broad range of geometries (flat, tubular, 3D structured), it can dissipate heat from large areas, and it can be suitable for high power applications with low/medium heat fluxes. PHP functioning is based on the capillary\n\nText continuation:\neffect, which provides the existence of liquid plugs completely filling the channel cross-section, in a way that any expansion or contraction of the vapour slugs will naturally generate a movement of the fluid along the channel axis. For this, it is important that the channel has a cross-section size below a given threshold, which depends on the liquid surface tension and (for a static fluid) on the gravity acceleration. In space, when only residual accelerations are acting, such a static size threshold is virtually infinite, while a finite dynamic threshold exists even in the absence of gravity. The concept of a ''Space PHP'' was originally developed in 2014 by the team, and from then 17 Parabolic Flight Campaigns (PFC) and 3 Sounding Rocket (SR) experiments have been carried out to generate the data for the preparation of an experiment targeting a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) mission. Both a tubular and a flat plate PHP have been successfully tested in reduced gravity and on ground, by using different combinations of fluids and building materials. The need for having an experiment on a LEO environment is mainly because, during a PFC, only 22sec of reduced gravity are possible, which is a period below the characteristic time for reaching a steady state condition for almost all of the tested devices. Instead, a steady state was reached using the SR campaigns: in this case however, only one experimental condition was achievable, and long-duration data of the PHP performance still remains beyond reach. Several measurement methodologies have been used to characterise the Space PHP, like infrared analysis, high-speed camera visualisation techniques, with data processed with different techniques, from wavelets to inverse heat transfer problem solution. The results clearly showed that PHPs are very interesting for space applications due to their simplicity of construction, the capacity to transfer heat up to several hundred watts, a high power/weight ratio, their geometrical adaptability, and, in particular, the Space PHP will be a breakthrough technology for space thermal management.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No.\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

He's in his last year, I'm 2 years under his. \nI'd like to go and speak to him without sounding weird or off. I'm pretty good at socialising normally but I become very shy for certain people. \nThere's an aura surrounding him if that makes sense?\nI'm interested in an amicable way. \nAny tips? Did a similar situation happen to y'all?\nPenguinJockey17: He\u2019s barely older than you. Unless he\u2019s a senior I don\u2019t see what\u2019s stopping you from asking him out, and the only reason I think it\u2019s different if he\u2019s a senior is because that would mean your relationship would immediately have one of you a long distance away. Are you in high school or college and has he shown any interest in you?\nVenUs\n\nText continuation:\n_buddy809: Yeah, we're in high school and I've noticed he's been looking at me a few times, but I don't know if it's just friendly or something more. I'm really nervous about approaching him because I don't want to come across as creepy or desperate.\nIt's funny, because when I'm around him, I feel like I can be myself, but at the same time, I'm terrified of ruining the dynamic we have. I don't want to make him uncomfortable or make him feel like he's being hit on.\nI've been thinking about trying to find common ground, like a shared interest or something, to break the ice. But at the same time, I don't want to overthink it and come across as too eager.\nHas anyone else ever been in a situation like this? How did you handle it?\nPenguinJockey17: I think you're overthinking it, to be honest. People are often more open to getting to know someone than we think they are. Just be yourself, be respectful, and see where it goes. If he's not interested, then that's okay. You'll learn from the experience and move on.\nThat being said, it's good that you're considering his feelings and not wanting to make him uncomfortable. That shows you're thinking about him as a person, not just as a potential partner.\nIf you do decide to talk to him, try to find a quiet spot where you can have a conversation without distractions. And don't be afraid to ask him questions about himself - people love talking about themselves, and it's a great way to build a connection.\nAlso, don't put too much pressure on the situation. Just enjoy the conversation and see where it takes you. And if it doesn't work out, then that's okay too.

He's in his last year, I'm 2 years under his. \nI'd like to go and speak to him without sounding weird or off. I'm pretty good at socialising normally but I become very shy for certain people. \nThere's an aura surrounding him if that makes sense?\nI'm interested in an amicable way. \nAny tips? Did a similar situation happen to y'all?\nPenguinJockey17: He\u2019s barely older than you. Unless he\u2019s a senior I don\u2019t see what\u2019s stopping you from asking him out, and the only reason I think it\u2019s different if he\u2019s a senior is because that would mean your relationship would immediately have one of you a long distance away. Are you in high school or college and has he shown any interest in you?\nVenUs\n\nText continuation:\n_buddy809: I'm in high school and no, he doesn't seem interested in me. Although it's a bit weird but we look at each other quite often. Like eye contact. This has happened a lot of time in the past weeks. I tried to talk about him at one of his friends and he said that he's very reserved and has a small group of friends that always sticks with him, which makes things harder for me \ud83d\ude05\nPenguinJockey17: Good news and bad news. \nThe good news is it sounds like he might be interested, if he\u2019s got a small friend group and is usually kinda reserved but still talks to you and makes eye contact. \nThe bad news is he\u2019s going to be probably going off to college next year, and long-distance relationships are hard to maintain especially when there\u2019s only a few months of relationship to support it.\nVenUs_buddy809: No he doesn't talk to me. He never spoke to me and I never did too. And I know, that's why I'm even more hesitant to speak to him. Even tho his friends seems nice\nPenguinJockey17: Oh, okay. That changes things a lot. Have you talked to him at all?\nVenUs_buddy809: Nope at least not yet \ud83d\ude05 I made this post to get some advices on how to approach him\nPenguinJockey17: Cold approach. A girl I used to have a crush on used to be my best friend, we got along great and hung out and talked a lot but I never picked up on any of the (frankly blunt as fuck) hints she was dropping\nVenUs_buddy809: I don't understand, you suggest me to do a cold approach?\nPenguinJockey17: Look, you\u2019ve got two options. Option A is try to become friends with him to try to get to know him a little better, then ask him out if you think he\u2019s a good match (just FYI it never worked out in my favor but that\u2019s most likely just a me issue). Option B is skipping that and straight up asking him out\nVenUs_buddy809: I don't want to ask him out \ud83d\ude2d just want to be friends lol\nPenguinJockey17: Oh, I\u2019ve been reading this the wrong way. If you just want to be friends you could either be friends with his friends and get introduced or, again, cold approach. Just ask if he\u2019d want to hang out or talk or something\nVenUs_buddy809: Yeah I think I'm gonna do the cold approach \ud83d\ude29 I only know two of his friends and one of them is not in school rn.

This is notably the case for Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council[18] and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council[19], where a third party conformity assessment is provided for medium-risk and high-risk products. [18] Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and repealing\n\nText continuation:\nDirective 90/385/EEC, and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2017 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices, amending Directive 98/79/EC and repealing Council Directive 98/79/EC, are examples of regulations that provide for a third party conformity assessment for medium-risk and high-risk products.\nIn the context of AI systems, this means that even if an AI system is considered high-risk under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the product or system that incorporates the AI system may not necessarily be considered high-risk under the relevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. This is because the risk associated with the AI system may be mitigated by other safety components or features of the product or system. For example, a medical device that uses AI to diagnose a medical condition may be considered medium-risk if it is designed to provide a diagnosis that is reviewed and confirmed by a human healthcare professional.\nFurthermore, the EU's Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and the EU's In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR) provide for a risk-based approach to the classification of medical devices, including those that use AI. Under these regulations, the risk associated with a medical device is determined by the device's intended use, the level of invasiveness, and the potential harm that the device may cause if it fails or is used incorrectly. If an AI system is used in a medical device, the risk associated with the device will depend on the specific use case and the level of risk associated with the AI system itself.\nIn conclusion, the classification of an AI system as high-risk under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) does not necessarily mean that the product or system that incorporates the AI system is considered high-risk under the relevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. The risk associated with an AI system must be assessed in the context of the specific product or system in which it is used, and the risk-based approach provided for in the EU's Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and the EU's In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR) should be used to determine the appropriate level of risk associated with the device.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

We had previously studied an ionic metal-polymer composites (IPMC), which consists in an ionic polymer film such as Nafion saturated with water and coated on both sides with a thin layer of metal acting as electrodes. This system bends when it is subject to an electric field orthogonal to the film and can thus be used as an actuator. Conversely, the deflection of the film generates a potential difference between the electrodes ; the same system can therefore be used as a sensor.We have developed a ''continuous medium'' model for this system.

In the field of prosthetics, IPMC-based sensors could be used to create prosthetic limbs that can detect and respond to subtle changes in the user's movements and intentions. In biomedical devices, IPMC-based energy harvesters could be used to power implantable devices, such as pacemakers or cochlear implants, eliminating the need for batteries and reducing the risk of complications.\nFurthermore, we are also investigating the possibility of using IPMC-based systems in energy storage and conversion applications. For example, IPMC-based supercapacitors could be used to store electrical energy generated by renewable sources, such as solar or wind power, and release it when needed. Additionally, IPMC-based fuel cells could be used to convert chemical energy into electrical energy, providing a clean and efficient source of power for vehicles and other applications.\nOverall, the potential applications of IPMC-based systems are vast and varied, and we are excited to continue exploring the possibilities of this technology and its potential to revolutionize various fields.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n\nText start", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The central part of the device consists in two interpenetrating polymers playing the role of an ions reservoir. The PEDOT is polymerized on each side and forms an interpenetrating network with the two other polymers. A pseudo trilayer is obtained, the two outer layers containing the PEDOT acting as electrodes. It is then saturated with an ionic liquid. When the blade thus obtained is placed in an electric field orthogonal to its faces, the PEDOT undergoes a reduction reaction (or dedoping) on the side of the negative electrode, which attracts cations from the central part and therefore swells ; the blade ultimately bends towards the positive electrode.We have first adapted our model to this two-components system : the cations on the one hand, and the three polymers and the anions on the other hand. We have written its balance equations and thermodynamic relations first at the microscopic scale for each phase, then at the macroscopic scale for the whole material using an averaging technique. The thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes then provides its constitutive relations : a Kelvin - Voigt type stress-strain relation and generalized Fourier's and Darcy's laws. The equations obtained were applied to the case of a cantilevered blade subject to a continuous potential difference at constant temperature. The numerical resolution of the equations system enabled us to draw the profiles of the different quantities, which are very steep functions near the electrodes. We also evaluated the tip displacement and the force that must be exerted on the free end of the beam to prevent its displacement (blocking force). The results obtained are in good agreement with the experimental data published in the literature.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " No.\n\nI have some"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No.\n\nI have some"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " No.\n\nI have some"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ":"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ":"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No.\n\nI have some"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

But at the same time, I don't want to give up on the progress I've made so far. I've been doing these assisted pull-ups with resistance bands and it's been helping me build up some strength, but it's not the same as doing a real pull-up.\nI've also been trying to focus on my form and engagement during these assisted pull-ups, but it's hard to tell if I'm doing it right. I feel like I'm using my legs and hips more than my arms and back, which is probably not the most effective way to build up my pull-up strength.\nI've been thinking about trying to mix up my routine and add some other exercises that target the same muscle groups as pull-ups, like rows and lat pulldowns. Maybe that will help me build up some strength and momentum and get me back on track with the pull-up progression.\nAnother thing I've been considering is trying to incorporate some isometric holds into my routine. I've heard that isometric exercises can be really effective for building up strength and endurance, and it might be a good way to target the muscles I need to build up for pull-ups.\nI've also been thinking about trying to incorporate some plyometric exercises into my routine. Plyometric exercises are exercises that involve rapid, powerful movements, and they can be really effective for building up strength and power. Maybe doing some plyometric pull-ups or assisted pull-ups with a rapid, explosive movement could help me build up some strength and momentum.\nI know it's easy to get frustrated and disheartened when you're not seeing the progress you want, but I'm trying to stay positive and focused.

I feel like I'd struggle to get a single deadhang pullup right now. Means I've gone backwards in a year. I know CC is meant to be helping with base strength and all at first but... does this make sense? I think if I wasn't doing grip training deadhangs I wouldn't even be able to hang off a bar. \nWould appreciate advice. Either put my head down and continue building reps with CC step  (I'm currently up to about 19 on the first set, 12 on the second. At my current rate I'd estimate I'll take another 4-5 months to reach progression standard) or move to a better more useful progression - if so what?\nhybridchildren: Hey, don't be disheartened, man! I've spent over 1 year stuck on some exercise then suddenly progress super fast once I discovered the weakness in my training. I'm confident you can do it too.\nSo let me get this straight; you could do 3-4 full pull ups before doing CC? If so, why not start at level 5 instead of level 2? I'm guessing I'm misunderstanding you.\nAnyway, like m092 says, my suggestion is to practice negatives to build up strength to reach full pull ups. I don't know how dedicated you are to CC, but I also suggest you abandon it (AT LEAST for pull ups; you can work on the other big 6 if you like) in favor of a different progression method. Depending on your goals, I think you can achieve full PU and OAPU following a simpler path. \nSo here's what I'd do if I were you. \n#1 do (or build up to) 3x5 sets of FULL, slow negatives for your PU training. No more jack knife pulls. \n#2 I don't know the rest of your workout, but if this is an important goal, put the negatives in the beginning of the workout. \n#3 Once you are more confident with your negatives, give PUs a shot again. If you can do 1 set of 3 reps, I'd say thats enough to move on from negatives and start training PUs themselves. Work up to 3x5 again.\n#4 If you have spare weight in the form of fat, focus on losing some of it through healthier/reduced eating. This will not only help your PUs but all other BW exercises. DO NOT amputate a leg or two for quick gainz.\n#5 report back in 2 weeks with progress, no matter how small or big. \ncomputersaidno: I'll try this. \nmyp123: Errr, still waiting on that report.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n\n", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": No\n\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": No\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\n", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The Moroccan Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Logistics, and Water aims to build an additional 3380 kilometers of expressway and 2100 kilometers of highway by 2030, at an expected cost of $9.6 billion. It focuses on linking the southern provinces, notably the cities of Laayoune and Dakhla to the rest of Morocco.\nIn 2014, Morocco began the construction of the first high-speed railway system in Africa linking the cities of Tangiers and Casablanca. It was inaugurated in 2018 by the King following over a decade of planning and construction by Moroccan national railway company ONCF. It is the first phase of what is planned to eventually be a 1,500 kilometeres (930 mi) high-speed rail network in Morocco. An extension of the line to Marrakesh is already being planned.\nMorocco also has the largest port in Africa and the Mediterranean called Tanger-Med, which is ranked the 18th in the world with a handling capacity of over 9 million containers. It is situated in the Tangiers free economic zone and serves as a logistics hub for Africa and the world.\n\nSummary:\nAccording to the article, Morocco has the following infrastructure:\nRoads: Ranked 32nd in the world, with over 1770 kilometers of modern roads built over the past 20 years and plans to build an additional 3380 kilometers of expressway and 2100 kilometers of highway by 2030.\nSea: Ranked 16th in the world, with the largest port in Africa and the Mediterranean, Tanger-Med, which is ranked 18th globally with a handling capacity of over 9 million containers.\nAir: Ranked 45th in the world.\nRailways: Ranked 64th in the world, with a high-speed railway system linking Tangiers and Casablanca and plans to extend to Marrakesh and eventually build a 1,500 kilometer high-speed rail network.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

They say they like a certain musician, listen to that musician before the next time you see them so you can comment on that.  The easiest way to fake an interest in a person is not to fake it, genuinely look into what they are interested in.  \nIt doesn't even have to be something you like.  My friend is a football fan, and I fucking hate sports.  But I know the team she likes and the team she hates, and I put stuff from the team she hates on her desk at work.  Even if you do something annoying to tease a friend, at least do it in a way that shows you listen to what they say and see them.\nPhysical_Key_4041: so with the musician example say I listen to a band they recommend, how would I then comment about that band in the follow up conversation\nlike for example I like avatar the last air bender (show) yet even if I meet someone else who likes the show I wouldn\u2019t know how to talk about it with them, like do I just say \u201cI liked the band you recommended\u201d surely not that ain\u2019t really a convo, so like say I listen to the band they recommend, how would I then discuss that band with them \nor take avatar the last airbender how would I discuss the show with someone that\u2019s already seen it\nthe_entroponaut: That's an interesting question, because I guess if I said \"It will just flow from there\" then that wouldn't be helpful at all!  \nIt is tricky to answer though, because conversations are so dynamic that it is hard to apply programmatic rules to them.  I mean, I loved The Last Airbender, but it is hard to come up with cold topics about it.  Personally I might bring up themes of apotheosis in shows (though some people might think I'm pretentious for that, but I am pretentious so I guess that's just me).  Or how I really love that the series format can grant a long time for several character development arcs that a movie can't, evolving into a metal bender or a blood bender and such.  Basically you are going to go into some (but not exhaustive) detail about why you liked it, and your favorite parts, and find out theirs.\nAnd that guidelines applies to most topics.  Music talk tends to be a bit more shallow (unless you are a musician) than movie/TV talk.  It's usually along a format of \"I liked this band, it reminded me of this band, have you heard of them?\"  A finding common ground kind of thing.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".

It is now the main attraction at Hartlepool's Maritime Experience and attracts 54,000 visitors a year.\nBryn Hughes, general manager of the HMS Trincomalee Trust said: \"The positive links with the NMRN in Portsmouth will heighten public awareness of HMS Trincomalee.\n\"It is a wonderful long-term scheme following hard on the profile of the recent Tall Ships Races so successfully staged in Hartlepool.\"\nThe rarely seen journals will eventually be included in the static Trincomalee exhibition in Hartlepool.\nOne journal dates from 1852 and was kept by midshipman William Dawson. It contains a detailed log and tracking maps of the journeys that HMS Trincomalee took during that period.\nDr Dominic Tweddle, director general of the NMRN, said: \"The opportunity to welcome HMS Trincomalee as a part of the museum means that the story of the Royal Navy, its ships and its people can now be told on a national scale.\"\nHMS Trincomalee was built for the Admiralty in Bombay and served in the West Indies and the Pacific.\nIt was stationed in West Hartlepool between 1862 and 1877 as a training ship.\n\nSummary:\nThe journals of HMS Trincomalee, written by sailors on board the 1817 vessel, will be incorporated into the National Museum of the Royal Navy, providing a unique glimpse into the ship's history.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"No\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".

It is now the main attraction at Hartlepool's Maritime Experience and attracts 54,000 visitors a year.\nBryn Hughes, general manager of the HMS Trincomalee Trust said: \"The positive links with the NMRN in Portsmouth will heighten public awareness of HMS Trincomalee.\n\"It is a wonderful long-term scheme following hard on the profile of the recent Tall Ships Races so successfully staged in Hartlepool.\"\nThe rarely seen journals will eventually be included in the static Trincomalee exhibition in Hartlepool.\nOne journal dates from 1852 and was kept by midshipman William Dawson. It contains a detailed log and tracking maps of the journeys that HMS Trincomalee took during that period.\nDr Dominic Tweddle, director general of the NMRN, said: \"The opportunity to welcome HMS Trincomalee as a part of the museum means that the story of the Royal Navy, its ships and its people can now be told on a national scale.\"\nHMS Trincomalee was built for the Admiralty in Bombay and served in the West Indies and the Pacific.\nIt was stationed in West Hartlepool between 1862 and 1877 as a training ship.\n\nSummary:\nCrew diaries which had been locked away for 150 years are being reunited with Britain's oldest surviving warship at a special ceremony on Teesside.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\" because the", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\" because the", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\" because the"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\" because the", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\" because the", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\" because the", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\" because the", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\" because the", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\"", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\" because the", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\"", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".

It was amazing to feel like I was being heard and understood without judgment. We talked for about an hour, and I was surprised by how much better I felt after the call.

I realized that sometimes, all we need is someone to talk to, and that warm lines can be a valuable resource for those who are struggling. If you're going through a tough time and feel like you need someone to talk to, I highly recommend looking into warm lines in your area.

They do follow-up calls to make sure you're still OK later. They confer with each other to make sure you're being helped effectively. If they think you are a serious threat to yourself or others, they can send someone to help you; but it's almost exclusively just you having a conversation with an empathetic peer. \nBe well my friend.\nelastic-craptastic: I just don't wanna be a debbie downer to my friends but have no one that understands my personal struggles.

The twelfth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, Larry originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa and organized into a tropical depression on August 31. The next day, the depression developed into a tropical storm, receiving the name Larry. The storm moved quickly across the far eastern tropical Atlantic, where it strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane the morning of September 2. Then, after undergoing a period of rapid intensification, Larry became a major Category 3 hurricane early on September 4. After churning for several days as a strong hurricane in the\n\nText continuation:\ncentral Atlantic, Larry began to weaken due to increasing wind shear and dry air. However, the storm's circulation remained large and sprawling, with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 200 miles from its center.\nAs the storm continued to move northwestward, Larry's outer rain bands began to affect the eastern United States, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to the region. The National Hurricane Center issued tropical storm watches and warnings for parts of the Carolinas and Virginia, where the storm's outer rain bands brought sustained winds of up to 50 mph and heavy rain totals of up to 4 inches. Meanwhile, the storm's center continued to move slowly northwestward, eventually making landfall in Newfoundland, Canada on September 11. The storm's impact in Newfoundland was significant, with sustained winds of up to 100 mph and heavy rain totals of up to 8 inches causing widespread power outages and flooding. The storm's remnants continued to move northward, eventually dissipating over the North Atlantic Ocean several days later. Despite its weakening, Hurricane Larry's impact was still felt across the region, with the storm's outer rain bands bringing heavy rain and strong winds to parts of Europe and the North Atlantic.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Christine Ohuruogu is the defending 400m champion and is raring to go.

If not, what's wrong with that? Hypertrophy is the goal btw\nwerdiser: Not a bad idea to do a regression as super sets. After a paired set (such as weighed pulls and dips), I occasionally will add a little volume at the end with a couple sets of regular pulls / dips. I do them after I finish the main part of the workout so it doesn't affect my other pair (rows / pushups)\n592dan: Decline, pseudo, dips, pike are the main exercises in my push routine. So you could say the diamonds and wide are a regression\nwerdiser: Yea, if your main goal is hypertrophy then I would still recommend doing those extra sets after your main strength focused exercises.\nI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re doing RR but if time becomes a factor maybe a Push/Pull split might work better for you?\n592dan: They're all hypertrophy focused. I'll still do them but I'm wondering if I superset some exercises.

By pooling their resources and expertise, the participating companies aim to produce a staggering 10 million face masks per week, a significant increase from the current production capacity.\nThe manufacturing process will involve a complex supply chain, with raw materials being sourced from various suppliers, then spun into yarn, woven into fabric, and finally cut and sewn into masks. Parkdale Mills will serve as the lead manufacturer, with the other companies contributing their expertise in different stages of the production process.\nThe effort is being coordinated through the National Council of Textile Organizations, a trade association that represents the interests of the U.S. textile industry. The organization has been working closely with government agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to ensure that the face masks meet the necessary standards and are distributed efficiently to those who need them most.\nThe participating companies have also pledged to donate a portion of their production to local hospitals and healthcare facilities, recognizing the critical role that these institutions play in the fight against the pandemic. By providing these organizations with a steady supply of face masks, the textile industry is helping to ensure that medical professionals have the necessary equipment to care for patients and keep themselves safe.\nAs the production ramp-up begins, the participating companies are working around the clock to meet the demand for face masks. Parkdale Mills has already mobilized its workforce, with employees working extended shifts to meet the increased production requirements. Other companies are also diverting resources to support the effort, with some even setting up temporary manufacturing facilities to increase capacity.\nThe textile industry's response to the pandemic is a testament to the sector's resilience and adaptability. Despite the challenges posed by the crisis, the industry has come together to support the nation's healthcare system, demonstrating its commitment to the greater good. As the country continues to navigate the pandemic, the textile industry's efforts will play a critical role in protecting the health and well-being of Americans, and its contributions will be remembered as a shining example of the power of collaboration and determination.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

He was born at Bayreuth, Bavaria and died at Dresden.\nHe studied at Erlangen, held various professorships in the philosophical and theological faculties of Erlangen and G\u00f6ttingen, succeeded Franz Volkmar Reinhard (1753\u20131812) in 1813 as court preacher and member of the Upper Consistory of the Church of Saxony at Dresden, retired from these offices in 1849.\nSeeking to establish for himself a middle position between rationalism and supernaturalism, he declared for a \"rational supernaturalism,\" and contended that there must be a gradual development of Christian doctrine corresponding to the advance of knowledge and science. But at the same time he sought, like other representatives of this\n\nText continuation:\nmovement, to reconcile the contradictions between faith and reason, and to demonstrate the harmony between the principles of Christianity and the discoveries of modern science.\nAs a result, Ammon's theological writings were characterized by a distinctive blend of rationalism and mysticism, and he became known for his ability to present complex theological concepts in a clear and accessible manner. His works were widely read and respected, and he was regarded as one of the leading theologians of his time. Despite his efforts to find a middle ground, however, Ammon's views were not without controversy, and he faced criticism from both rationalist and supernaturalist quarters. Nevertheless, his legacy as a pioneering figure in the development of modern theology remains significant, and his ideas continue to influence theological thought to this day.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Rev. D 80, 024015, arxiv:0808.3484) that the equation of state (ES) of extremely hot Fermi-Dirac gas in the surface layer of an ultra-relativistic compact object converges to the same form as the relativistic equation of thermodynamical equilibrium (RETE), which is the condition of stability of the object. The description of energy state of a gas particle was completed with the term corresponding with the potential-type energy. The necessity of such the term is set by the demand of convergence of the relativistic particle-impulse distribution law to its Maxwell-Boltzmann form in the classical limit. The identity of the ES and RETE, both applied to the gas in the object's surface layer, becomes\n\nText continuation:\nmore evident when considering the implications of this convergence on the behavior of the gas in the vicinity of the event horizon. In particular, the study reveals that the Fermi-Dirac gas exhibits a unique property, known as \"quantum smearing,\" which arises from the interplay between the quantum nature of the gas and the strong gravitational field of the compact object. This smearing effect leads to a modification of the equation of state, which in turn affects the stability of the object. The investigation also highlights the importance of considering the effects of quantum statistics on the behavior of the gas in the surface layer, as these effects can significantly impact the overall stability of the compact object. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the relativistic equation of thermodynamical equilibrium can be used as a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of extreme astrophysical systems, such as black holes and neutron stars.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The identity of the ES and RETE, both applied to the gas in the object's surface layer, becomes\n\nText continuation:\nperfect, yielding the stable object, when the object's physical radius is identical to its gravitational radius. In this state, the internal energy of gas particles in a volume of the object's surface layer increases over all limits in the frame of the volume and this opens the question if the horizon of events actually is an insuperable barrier. It seems to be possible that some matter can be temporarily lifted above the surface or, so far, be ejected from the object and can emit a radiation detectable by a distant observer. In our contribution, we demonstrate a general validity of the functional form of the potential-type energy found in our previous work. The consistency of the RETE with its non-relativistic approximation can occur only for this functional form. We also point out some observational consequences of the approximate identity of ES and RETE before the object collapses, in the proper time, to its gravitational radius as well as the possible observational consequences of the infinitely high internal energy in the surface layer of already collapsed object. In general, we propagate the idea that a lot of phenomena observed at the stellar-sized or supermassive black holes (or not-yet black holes) can be not necessarily related to the structures in a vicinity of the black hole, e.g. to an accretion disk, but they can be linked directly to the behaviour of the central, ultra-compact object.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes.\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Everywhere online i see tips like \"have an interesting life\" \"do some stuff and attract people\" here's a thing: i consider myself interesting person, i do graphic design, photography, ilustration/painting, a bit of programming - but it's only interesting to me. I don't even try to portray myself as outgoing vivid person because i know that would be lying, but even if i tried - am i supposed to take my date to art gallery to bore her completely ?

Like, you're not trying to be boring, but you're just genuinely interested in things that others might not find exciting? I've tried to make small talk and pretend to be into things that I'm not, but it always feels so fake and I end up feeling like I'm wasting my time. I've also tried to be more open about my interests, but it seems like people are just polite and pretend to be interested, but then they don't actually follow up or ask me more about it.\nI've started to feel like I'm just not cut out for the whole dating scene. Like, I'm not a party animal, I don't like loud music or crowded places, and I don't really care about sports or pop culture. I'm just a quiet, introverted person who likes to spend time alone or with a few close friends, doing things that bring me joy. And that seems to be a major turn-off for most people. I've tried to compromise and do things that I think others might like, but it always feels like I'm sacrificing a part of myself to try to fit in. And honestly, I'm just tired of feeling like I have to be someone I'm not in order to be liked or accepted.\nI've also started to wonder if it's even worth it. Like, is it really worth putting myself out there and risking rejection and disappointment, just to try to find someone who might be interested in me for who I am? Or is it better to just focus on my own happiness and fulfillment, and not worry about what others think? I don't know, I'm just really confused and frustrated right now.

I feel like guys who party and drink have it easier with girls.

You don't need to show up to your friends party to show yourself with a bf ? Im sorry but pretty much all females i've met so far were like that. How am i supposed to think differently when life long experience days otherwise ?\nghxststories: No, I don't go to parties or have partners to show them off! Yeah I expect cool dates, but to me thatd be going to mini golf or an arcade or just getting take out and watching a movie. \nI think youre looking in the wrong places, or going after the wrong kind of girls for you :) \nAlso, 24 is still young, im 27 now and only just figuring out what im into, your life experience is probably college age girls and guys who dont have it figured out yet, maybe ya gotta go for an older lady!\nEither way, suggesting an entire gender are only into one thing, probs not the best way to go about it.\nfuckyeapancakes: What are good places then ? Please don't write \"everywhere\" i need specific tips, i also suspect that most girls i would be into, are hiding in their houses :/ i don't think 24 is that young, it's not old yet either but most people around me have it figured out\nghxststories: I think the hardest part no doubt is putting yourself out there, I feel like youre already destining yourself to fail thinking you'll bore people, but as cheesy as it sounds, as long as youre passionate about something that will shine through and make you seem interesting. And if people aint interested in you for what youre intested in, fuck em.\nIf you've got your stuff sorted at 24, damn well work that! Appreciate yourself for a while, and dont rush to try and find someone else. I was scared to be single for so long, and now I am learning to embrace it.\nShe says, binge eating cheese and watching jumanji \ud83d\ude04\nfuckyeapancakes: Ok thanks, im actually trying my best to look for people online but people seem to be more picky and not-easily-impressed when online.

The method, based on Nitroxide-Mediated Polymerization (NMP), consists to bind covalently the alkoxyamine, which acts as initiator controller agent, at the silica nanoparticles surface in two steps. The first step is a reaction between the aminopropylsilane and the silica particles in order to functionalize the particles surface with amino group. In a second step, the initiating-controlling alkoxyamine moiety is introduced via an over grafting reaction between the amino group and the N-hydroxysuccinimide based MAMA-SG1 activated ester. To simplify both their chemical transformation and the polymerization step, the native silica particles, initially dispersed in water\n\nText continuation:\n, are first modified with aminopropylsilane to introduce amino groups on their surface. This modification enables the subsequent covalent binding of the alkoxyamine moiety, which serves as both an initiator and a controller for the polymerization reaction.\nThe resulting PS-silica nanoparticles exhibit a well-defined structure and a high degree of dispersion, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including biomedicine, catalysis, and optoelectronics. The grafting-from approach used in this method offers several advantages, including the ability to control the size and shape of the nanoparticles, as well as the molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymer chains. Additionally, the use of NMP allows for the synthesis of well-defined polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions, which is critical for many applications.\nFurthermore, the grafting-from method enables the incorporation of functional groups into the polymer chains, which can be used to tailor the properties of the nanoparticles. For example, the incorporation of hydrophilic groups can improve the dispersion of the nanoparticles in aqueous media, while the incorporation of hydrophobic groups can enhance their compatibility with organic solvents. The versatility of this method makes it an attractive approach for the synthesis of PS-silica nanoparticles with tailored properties for specific applications.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

To simplify both their chemical transformation and the polymerization step, the native silica particles, initially dispersed in water\n\nText continuation:\n, have been transferred in an organic solvent, the dimethylacetamide, which is also a good solvent for the polystyrene. The synthesis parameters have been optimized for grafting density, conversion rates, and synthesis reproducibility while keeping the colloidal stability and to avoid any aggregation of silica particles induced by the inter-particles interaction evolution during the synthesis. After synthesis, the final grafted objects have been purified and the non-grafted polymer chains formed in the solvent have been washed out by ultra filtration. Then the particles have been studied using Small angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) coupled to neutron contrast variation method. To optimize the contrast conditions, both hydrogenated and deuterated monomers have been used for the synthesis. A refined fitting analysis based on the comparison on two models, a basic core-shell and the Gaussian Pedersen model, enables us to fit nicely the experimental data for both the hydrogenated and deuterated grafted case. Differences are seen between grafting of normal or deuterated chains which can be due to monomer reactivity or to neutron contrast effect variations. The synthesis and the characterization method established in this work constitute a robust and reproducible way to design well defined grafted polymer nanoparticles. These objects will be incorporated in polymer matrices in a further step to create Nanocomposites for polymer reinforcement.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In this article, we define a generalization of Schnyder woods to $d$-angulations (plane graphs with faces of degree $d$) for all $d\\geq 3$. A \\emph{Schnyder decomposition} is a set of $d$ spanning forests crossing each other in a specific way, and such that each internal edge is part of exactly $d-2$ of the spanning forests. We show that a Schnyder decomposition exists if and only if the girth of the $d$-angulation is $d$. As in the case of Schnyder woods ($d=3$), there are alternative formulations in terms of orientations (\"fractional\" orientations when $d\\geq 5$) and in terms of corner-labellings. Moreover, the set of Schnyder decompositions on a fixed $d\n\nText continuation:\n$-angulation is a polyhedral fan, whose maximal cones correspond to the possible Schnyder decompositions. This allows us to apply the machinery of toric geometry to study the Schnyder decompositions, and in particular to compute the number of Schnyder decompositions on a given $d$-angulation. We also show that the Schnyder decompositions on a $d$-angulation can be used to construct a family of plane graphs with a specific property, which we call \"Schnyder-critical\" graphs. These graphs have the property that every edge is part of at least one Schnyder decomposition, and that every internal edge is part of exactly $d-2$ of the Schnyder decompositions. We prove that these graphs exist for all $d\\geq 3$, and that they are characterized by a certain property of their Schnyder decompositions.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n\nText start", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": No.\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": No.\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In this article, we define a generalization of Schnyder woods to $d$-angulations (plane graphs with faces of degree $d$) for all $d\\geq 3$. A \\emph{Schnyder decomposition} is a set of $d$ spanning forests crossing each other in a specific way, and such that each internal edge is part of exactly $d-2$ of the spanning forests. We show that a Schnyder decomposition exists if and only if the girth of the $d$-angulation is $d$. As in the case of Schnyder woods ($d=3$), there are alternative formulations in terms of orientations (\"fractional\" orientations when $d\\geq 5$) and in terms of corner-labellings. Moreover, the set of Schnyder decompositions on a fixed $d\n\nText continuation:\n$-angulation of girth $d$ is a distributive lattice. We also show that the structures dual to Schnyder decompositions (on $d$-regular plane graphs of mincut $d$ rooted at a vertex $v^*$) are decompositions into $d$ spanning trees rooted at $v^*$ such that each edge not incident to $v^*$ is used in opposite directions by two trees. Additionally, for even values of $d$, we show that a subclass of Schnyder decompositions, which are called even, enjoy additional properties that yield a reduced formulation; in the case d=4, these correspond to well-studied structures on simple quadrangulations (2-orientations and partitions into 2 spanning trees). In the case d=4, the dual of even Schnyder decompositions yields (planar) orthogonal and straight-line drawing algorithms. For a 4-regular plane graph $G$ of mincut 4 with $n$ vertices plus a marked vertex $v$, the vertices of $G\\backslash v$ are placed on a $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ grid according to a permutation pattern, and in the orthogonal drawing each of the $2n-2$ edges of $G\\backslash v$ has exactly one bend. Embedding also the marked vertex $v$ is doable at the cost of two additional rows and columns and 8 additional bends for the 4 edges incident to $v$. We propose a further compaction step for the drawing algorithm and show that the obtained grid-size is strongly concentrated around $25n/32\\times 25n/32$ for a uniformly random instance with $n$ vertices.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nDid someone"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nDid someone"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nDid someone"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nMy answer"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ":"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes.\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

This workshop bring together researchers applying compositional approaches to physics, NLP, cognitive science, and game theory. Within NLP, a long-standing aim is to represent how words can combine to form phrases and sentences. Within the framework of distributional semantics, words are represented as vectors in vector spaces. The categorical model of Coecke et al. [2010], inspired by quantum protocols, has provided a convincing account of compositionality in vector space models of NLP. There is furthermore a history of vector space models in cognitive science. Theories of categorization such as those developed by Nosofsky [1986] and Smith et al. [1988\n\nText continuation:\n] have also explored the idea of combining simple elements to form more complex concepts.\nIn the context of cognitive science, the study of compositionality has been driven by the need to understand how humans categorize and reason about complex concepts. For example, the theory of prototype-based categorization, developed by Rosch [1978], posits that categories are represented as clusters of features in a high-dimensional space, and that the similarity between two categories is determined by the similarity between their prototypes. This theory has been influential in the development of connectionist models of categorization, which have been used to simulate the human ability to recognize and generalize to new instances of a category.\nThe workshop will explore the connections between compositional approaches in NLP and cognitive science, and will discuss the potential for cross-fertilization between these fields. For example, the categorical model of Coecke et al. [2010] has been applied to a wide range of NLP tasks, including natural language inference, question answering, and machine translation. Similarly, the prototype-based theory of categorization has been used to model human categorization and reasoning in a variety of domains, including object recognition, event perception, and social cognition.\nIn addition to these theoretical connections, the workshop will also explore the practical applications of compositional approaches in NLP and cognitive science. For example, the development of compositional models of language understanding has the potential to improve the performance of natural language processing systems, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. Similarly, the study of compositionality in cognitive science has the potential to inform the development of more effective and efficient learning algorithms, as well as more accurate and robust models of human behavior.\nOverall, the workshop aims to bring together researchers from a range of disciplines to explore the connections between compositional approaches in NLP, cognitive science, and game theory. By fostering a deeper understanding of the theoretical and practical connections between these fields, the workshop hopes to inspire new research directions and applications that will advance our understanding of human language and cognition.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n\nI have", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

More recently G\\\"ardenfors [2004, 2014] has developed a model of concepts in which conceptual spaces provide geometric structures, and information is represented by points, vectors and regions in vector spaces. The same compositional approach has been applied to this formalism, giving conceptual spaces theory a richer model of compositionality than previously [Bolt et al., 2018]. Compositional approaches have also been applied in the study of strategic games and Nash equilibria. In contrast to classical game theory, where games are studied monolithically as one global object, compositional game theory works bottom-up by building large and complex games from smaller components. Such an approach is inherently difficult since the interaction between games has to be considered. Research into categorical compositional methods for this field have recently begun [Ghani et al., 2018]. Moreover, the interaction between the three disciplines of cognitive science, linguistics and game theory is a fertile ground for research. Game theory in cognitive science is a well-established area [Camerer, 2011]. Similarly game theoretic approaches have been applied in linguistics [J\\\"ager, 2008]. Lastly, the study of linguistics and cognitive science is intimately intertwined [Smolensky and Legendre, 2006, Jackendoff, 2007]. Physics supplies compositional approaches via vector spaces and categorical quantum theory, allowing the interplay between the three disciplines to be examined.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The contrast can be increased by converting the electron beam's phase modulation into amplitude modulation using a phase plate, a device that applies a $\\pi/2$ radian phase shift to part of the electron beam after it has passed through the sample. Previous phase plate designs rely on material placed in or near the electron beam to provide this phase shift. This results in image aberrations, an inconsistent time-varying phase shift, and resolution loss when the electron beam charges, damages, or is scattered from the material. In this thesis, I present the theory\n\nText continuation:\nand design of a novel phase plate that uses a nanostructured surface to achieve the desired phase shift, eliminating the need for material in or near the electron beam. This design allows for a consistent and precise phase shift, reducing image aberrations and improving resolution.\nThe nanostructured surface is composed of a periodic array of nanoscale features that are precisely controlled to achieve the desired phase shift. The features are designed to be transparent to the electron beam, minimizing beam-induced sample damage and allowing for a high usable electron dose. The surface is fabricated using a combination of electron beam lithography and plasma etching, allowing for precise control over the feature size and spacing.\nIn this study, I demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel phase plate design using a combination of simulation and experimental results. The simulations show that the nanostructured surface can achieve a consistent and precise phase shift, resulting in improved image contrast and resolution compared to previous phase plate designs. The experimental results confirm these findings, showing improved image contrast and resolution in transmission electron microscopy images of samples with low atomic number.\nThe implications of this work are significant, as it has the potential to revolutionize the field of transmission electron microscopy. The novel phase plate design could be used to improve image contrast and resolution in a wide range of applications, from materials science to biology and medicine. Additionally, the design could be used to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of transmission electron microscopy, allowing for the detection of smaller features and the analysis of more complex samples.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n\nI have", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The contrast can be increased by converting the electron beam's phase modulation into amplitude modulation using a phase plate, a device that applies a $\\pi/2$ radian phase shift to part of the electron beam after it has passed through the sample. Previous phase plate designs rely on material placed in or near the electron beam to provide this phase shift. This results in image aberrations, an inconsistent time-varying phase shift, and resolution loss when the electron beam charges, damages, or is scattered from the material. In this thesis, I present the theory\n\nText continuation:\n, design, and implementation of the laser phase plate, which instead uses a focused continuous-wave laser beam to phase shift the electron beam. A near-concentric Fabry-P\\'{e}rot optical cavity focuses and resonantly enhances the power of the laser beam in order to achieve the high intensity required to provide the phase shift. We demonstrate that the cavity can surpass this requirement and generate a record-high continuous-wave laser intensity of $590 \\, \\mathrm{GW}/\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. By integrating the cavity into a transmission electron microscope, we show that the ponderomotive potential of the laser beam applies a spatially selective phase shift to the electron beam. This enables us to make the first experimental observation of the relativistic reversal of the ponderomotive potential. We then theoretically analyze the properties of the contrast transfer function generated by the laser phase plate. We experimentally determine that resolution loss caused by thermal magnetic field noise emanating from electrically conductive materials in the cavity can be eliminated by designing the cavity with a sufficiently large electron beam aperture. Finally, we show that the laser phase plate provides a stable $\\pi/2$ phase shift and concomitant contrast enhancement when imaging frozen hydrated biological macromolecules. We use these images to successfully determine the structure of the molecules. This demonstrates the laser phase plate as the first stable and lossless phase plate for transmission electron microscopy\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Each redo log file consists of redo records. A redo record, also called a redo entry, holds a group of change vectors, each of which describes or represents a change made to a single block in the database.\nFor example, if a user UPDATEs a salary-value in a table containing employee-related data, the DBMS generates a redo record containing change-vectors that describe changes to the data segment block for the table. And if the user then COMMITs the update, Oracle generates another redo record and assigns the change a \"system change number\" (SCN).\nWhenever something changes in a datafile, Oracle records the change in the redo log. The name redo log indicates its purpose: If the database crashes, the RDBMS can redo (re-process) all changes on datafiles which will take the database data back to the state it was when the last redo record was written. DBAs use the views V$LOG, V$LOGFILE, V$LOG_HISTORY and V$THREAD to find information about the redo log of the database. Each redo log file belongs to exactly one group (of which at least two must exist). Exactly one of these groups is the CURRENT group (can be queried using the column status of v$log). Oracle uses that current group to write the redo log entries. When the group is full, a log switch occurs, making another group the current one. Each log switch causes checkpoint, however, the converse is not true: a checkpoint does not cause a redo log switch. One can also manually cause a redo-log switch using the ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE command.\n\nSummary:\nRedo logs in Oracle RDBMS are files in a proprietary format that log a history of all changes made to the database, allowing the database to be recovered in case of a crash.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".

Niven\n\nText continuation:\nappeared to be on course for further success in the 1949\u201350 season, but he was injured before the League Cup semi-final. East Fife won both the semi-final against Rangers and the final against Dunfermline without him. East Fife then reached the 1950 Scottish Cup Final, but Niven was injured in a league match five days earlier. The second choice goalkeeper was also injured. This meant that 21-year-old Gordon Easson had to make his first team debut for East Fife in the Cup Final. Easson conceded a goal within 30 seconds and East Fife went on to lose 3\u20130.\nNiven was transferred to Kilmarnock in 1951. He played in the 1952 Scottish League Cup Final, which Kilmarnock lost 2\u20130 to Dundee. Niven retired from senior football in 1953 and became a mechanical engineer, working for  Sir William Arrol & Co. He then set up a motor factor business, which he operated until his retirement in 1988. Niven suffered from Parkinson's disease in later life. He died in April 2011, and was survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Conversely, any pair of sections of S generates a (possibly periodic) conformal immersion of M under a suitable integrability condition, which for a minimal surface is simply that the spinor sections are meromorphic. A spin structure S also determines (and is determined by) the regular homotopy class of the immersion by way of a \\bbZ_2-quadratic\n\nText continuation:\n.\nThis spinor representation provides a powerful tool for studying conformal immersions of Riemann surfaces into space. By analyzing the properties of the spinor sections, we can gain insight into the geometry and topology of the immersion. For example, the meromorphicity of the spinor sections is closely related to the existence of a conformal metric on the surface, and the regular homotopy class of the immersion is determined by the spin structure.\nFurthermore, the spinor representation can be used to study the relationship between conformal immersions and other geometric objects, such as holomorphic curves and harmonic maps. For instance, a holomorphic curve in \\bbC^2 can be viewed as a conformal immersion of a Riemann surface into \\bbC^2, and the spinor representation can be used to study the properties of this immersion.\nIn addition, the spinor representation has applications in other areas of mathematics and physics, such as the study of topological invariants and the classification of conformal field theories. The spinor representation provides a powerful tool for studying these topics, and has been used to make important advances in these areas.\nIn conclusion, the spinor representation is a powerful tool for studying conformal immersions of Riemann surfaces into space.

We present an analytic expression for the Arf invariant of q_S, which decides whether or not the correponding immersion can be deformed to an embedding. The Arf invariant also turns out to be an obstruction, for example, to the existence of certain complete minimal immersions. The later parts of this paper use the spinor representation to investigate minimal surfaces with embedded planar ends. In general, we show for a spin structure S on a compact Riemann surface M with punctures at P that the space of all such (possibly periodic) minimal immersions of M\\setminus P into \\bbR^3 (upto homothety) is the the product of S^1\\times H^3 with the Grassmanian of 2-planes in a complex vector space \\calK of meromorphic sections of S. An important tool -- a skew-symmetric form \\Omega defined by residues of a certain meromorphic quadratic differential on M -- lets us compute how \\calK varies as M and P are varied. Then we apply this to determine the moduli spaces of planar-ended minimal spheres and real projective planes, and also to construct a new family of minimal tori and a minimal Klein bottle with 4 ends. These surfaces compactify in S^3 to yield surfaces critical for the \\Moebius invariant squared mean curvature functional W. On the other hand, Robert Bryant has shown all W-critical spheres and real projective planes arise this way. Thus we find at the same time the moduli spaces of W-critical spheres and real projective planes via the spinor representation.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes.\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes.\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes.\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes.\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes.\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

In 2021, it was held later, in October. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports, Inc., since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.\nThe event attracts 500,000 spectators each year, making it New England's most widely viewed sporting event. Starting with just 15 participants in 1897, the event now attracts an average of about 30,000 registered participants each year, with 30,251 people entering in 2015.

The pope arrives to address U.S. bishops in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He spoke at a prayer service with U.S. bishops at Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Roman Catholic church in North America. Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a \"deep shame\" and called it \"gravely immoral behavior.\" \"Many of you have spoken to me of the enormous pain that your communities have suffered when clerics have betrayed ... their obligations,\" he told the bishops. Responding to the situation has not been easy and was sometimes very badly handled, the pope admitted.  Watch the pope address the issue \u00bb . \"It is vitally important that the vulnerable are always shielded from souls who would cause harm,\" he said. The pope then turned his attention to a different concern involving kids. \"What does it mean to speak of child protection when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many homes through media widely available today?\" he asked. Benedict urged the media and entertainment industry to take part in a \"moral renewal.\" Earlier Wednesday, President Bush, first lady Laura Bush and more than 13,500 spectators welcomed Benedict in an elaborate ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. In remarks greeting the pope to the White House, Bush called the United States \"a nation of prayer.\" Bush was interrupted by applause as he said, \"In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded, we need your message that all human life is sacred and that each of us is willed.\" Benedict responded by praising the role of religion in the United States. \"From the dawn of the republic, America's quest for freedom has been guided by the conviction that the principles governing political and social life are intimately linked to a moral order based on the dominion of God the creator,\" he said.  Watch Benedict talk about his hopes for the trip \u00bb . Earlier, a U.S. Marine Corps band performed the national anthem of the Holy See as well as \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" A fife and drum corps in Colonial costumes also played tunes, including \"Yankee Doodle,\" and soprano Kathleen Battle sang \"The Lord's Prayer.\" The day, with perfect spring weather, was also the pontiff's 81st birthday.  After the ceremony concluded, the crowd, led by Battle, serenaded Benedict with \"Happy Birthday\" as he smiled from a White House balcony.  Watch a priest who has known Benedict for years tell what he's like \u00bb . Guests on the South Lawn included Catholic clergy, ecumenical representatives, Catholic schoolchildren, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Sisters of the Poor and Knights of Columbus. Event planners faced an enormous demand for tickets for what White House press secretary Dana Perino called \"one of the largest arrival ceremonies ever held at the White House.\" Following the ceremony, Bush and the pope had a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office. The pope left the White House at about noon in his distinctive \"popemobile.\" His massive motorcade moved slowly down the wide avenues of the U.S. capital to the Vatican Embassy, where the pope is staying. Crowds of enthusiastic spectators waved U.S. and Vatican flags and screamed as the pontiff rode past. A smiling Benedict arrived Tuesday at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to cheers from a crowd of invited guests. The pontiff was greeted by Bush, the first lady and their daughter Jenna, each of whom shook his hand. It was believed to be the first time an American president has greeted a world dignitary on arrival at Andrews. It marks Benedict's first visit to the United States as pope.   Watch how the pope's visit could affect the presidential campaign \u00bb . Security will be tight during the six-day visit, with 27 state, local and federal agencies protecting the pope as he meets with religious leaders, celebrates Mass at two baseball stadiums and makes his way around in the popemobile. Benedict faces no specific threats, according to the FBI, but a March audio message from Osama bin Laden mentioned the pontiff. The centerpiece of the trip's Washington leg will be Thursday's Mass at Nationals Park, a new baseball stadium where 46,000 people will gather to see the pope. Everyone must go through metal detectors on entering, and nearby roads and bridges will be closed. Temporary flight restrictions will be in place over the stadium, and a 1\u00bd-mile section of the adjacent Anacostia River will be closed during the Mass. Benedict will travel to New York on Friday and address the U.N. General Assembly, linking the visit to the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He'll celebrate Mass on Sunday morning at Yankee Stadium.  Where will the pope be? \u00bb . One of the stated goals of the pope's visit is to energize the U.S. Catholic community with its estimated 70 million members. Three years after succeeding Pope John Paul II, Benedict is likely to also address the church's relationship with other faiths, the U.S.-led war in Iraq and the upcoming U.S. presidential election, said John Allen, a CNN Vatican analyst.

Firefighters in a Paris suburb battle to control a blaze started after youths rioted Sunday night. An angry mob repeatedly clashed with riot police and torched cars and buildings in the town of Villiers-le-Bel, north of Paris, after two teens on a motorcycle were killed following a collision with a police car Sunday night. Rioters bombarded police with baseball bats, Molotov cocktail bombs and bottles filled with acid as the violence spread to the nearby towns of Longjumeau and Grigby Monday night. The 15- and 16-year-old boys, both sons of African immigrants, according to police, died when their motorbike hit a patrol car in Villiers-le-Bel. Some residents, populated largely by immigrants and their French-born children, accused police of fleeing the crash scene. However, three eyewitnesses, interviewed on TV, said the police stayed and tried to revive the two boys with mouth to mouth resuscitation.  Watch why a repeat of past rioting is feared \u00bb . More than 60 police officers were injured in Monday night's confrontation, with five kept in hospital in a serious condition, according to reports in a number of French newspapers. A spokesman for the police authorities in the Val d'Oise prefecture refused to confirm the numbers of police injuries, telling CNN that police feared the information could further enflame the already tense situation. The police spokesman said 60 cars, a library and car dealer's showroom had been set on fire in Villiers-le-Bel. He said a police station had also been damaged and 15 garbage cans torched. Security was tightened Tuesday, with helicopters deployed to patrol over the town, the spokesman said. Villiers-le-Bel was not among the districts hit by the weeks of nationwide rioting in November 2005, when disaffected youths nationwide set thousands of cars ablaze to protest against unemployment and discrimination. Those riots were also sparked by fatalities, namely the deaths of two men of North African descent who were electrocuted while hiding from police in an electrical substation. French president Nicolas Sarkozy, then serving as the interior minister, provoked controversy at the time by referring to the rioters as \"scum.\" Sarkozy, currently on a state visit to China, had urged residents Monday to \"cool down and let the justice system determine who is responsible for what.\" A spokesman for the president's office told CNN Tuesday they were continuing to monitor the situation. The prosecutor's office in the nearby town of Pontoise has already begun an inquiry into the deaths. Police said the teens drove through a red light without wearing helmets and on an unregistered bike. But Omar Sehhouli, the brother of one of the victims, told French media the police involved should be arrested. \"Everyone knew the two boys here,\" he told French radio. \"What happened, that's not violence, it's rage.\" According to the initial findings from the French police watchdog, reported Tuesday in the daily newspaper, Le Figaro, the boy's motorbike was driving \"at very high speed\" and had failed to give priority to the police patrol vehicle. The police car was driving normally at around 40 kilometers an hour, the newspaper reported the watchdog had found. E-mail to a friend .

He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education.\nFrom 1882 to 1922, Egypt was under British military occupation, and its government heavily under the influence (control) of the British Empire. The first Consul-General, Sir Evelyn Baring (later 1st Earl of Cromer), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian Ministry of Education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner.\nDunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant\n\nText continuation:\n) education system that would produce loyal and obedient citizens who would support British interests in the region. To achieve this, Dunlop introduced a number of reforms, including the creation of a new curriculum that emphasized Western-style education, the establishment of a network of schools and educational institutions, and the promotion of English language and culture.\nUnder Dunlop's guidance, the Egyptian education system was transformed, with a focus on producing students who were well-versed in Western subjects such as mathematics, science, and literature, but also familiar with British customs and values. The system was designed to produce a class of educated Egyptians who would be loyal to the British and supportive of their colonial rule. Dunlop's reforms were widely criticized by Egyptian nationalists, who saw them as a means of suppressing Egyptian culture and identity. Despite this, Dunlop's system remained in place for many years, shaping the course of Egyptian education and influencing the country's development for generations to come.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " No.", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\"", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education.\nFrom 1882 to 1922, Egypt was under British military occupation, and its government heavily under the influence (control) of the British Empire. The first Consul-General, Sir Evelyn Baring (later 1st Earl of Cromer), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian Ministry of Education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner.\nDunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant\n\nText continuation:\n) educated governing class and civil service, modelled on their experiences in British India. The education policy of the Egyptian government prior to the occupation had been to create a meritocratic system. Dunlop, on the other hand, oversaw the creation of an elitist two-tier system, with fees introduced for the elite schools. Modernisation also occurred, with elemental schooling being both centralised and expanded.\nPrior to the British occupation, the administrative languages of Egypt had been French and Turkish. With British influence, English became the preferred language. This brought increasing controversy, as Egyptian nationalists sought to reassert Arabic. Dunlop, even after thirty years in Egypt, like Cromer, did not speak Arabic. He primarily promoted teaching in English, preferring to employ British teachers and attempting to marginalise teaching in Arabic and French.\nIn 1907, Saad Zaghlul (later revolutionary leader and post-independence prime minister) became Minister of Education. Zaghul strongly promoted Arabic in education, and necessarily locking horns with his British advisor. Dunlop became a figure associated with British resistance to Egyptian anti-colonialism. Dunlop resigned his post during the Egyptian revolution of 1919.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"No\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nText start"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Companies take advantage of the fact that women are often willing to pay more for products that are marketed as \"feminine\" or \"pink\". It's not just razors, it's everything from shampoo to makeup to clothing. And it's not just about the price, it's about the message it sends. It's saying that women are willing to pay more for things that are marketed to them, and that they're not worth the same as men.\nGurgaon_ka_bachha: Exactly! And it's not just about the price, it's about the societal implications. When companies price their products higher for women, it perpetuates the idea that women are somehow less valuable than men. It's a subtle form of sexism, but it's still sexism.\nRedPillSailor: I see what you're saying, but I still think price controls are a bad idea. It's better to let the market decide what prices are fair. If companies are charging too much for their products, then people will just choose not to buy them.\nWTF_HomeSlice: But that's not always an option for women, especially those who are low-income or living in poverty. They may not have the luxury of choosing not to buy something because it's too expensive. That's why I think the government should step in and make sure that these products are affordable for everyone.\nMy wife and I have talked about this a lot, and we've come to the realization that we need to be more mindful of the products we buy and the companies we support. We try to buy from companies that are transparent about their pricing and that don't engage in discriminatory pricing practices.\nGurgaon_ka_bachha: That's a great point! Consumers have the power to make a change by voting with their wallets. By supporting companies that are fair and transparent, we can send a message that we won't tolerate discriminatory pricing practices.\nRedPillSailor: I agree, but I still think that government intervention is not the best solution.

David Paterson of New York has told state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states and countries where they are legal, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. The governor's legal counsel told state agencies in a May 14 memo to revise policies and regulations to recognize same-sex marriages performed in California and Massachusetts as well as Canada and other countries that allow gays and lesbians to marry, said Erin Duggan, the governor's spokeswoman. The memo informed state agencies that failing to recognize gay marriages would violate the New York's human rights law, Duggan said. The directive follows a February ruling from a New York state appeals court. That decision says that legal same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions are entitled to recognition in New York. \"This was in direct response to a court ruling,\" Duggan told CNN. \"Just to make sure all the state agencies are on the same page.\"  See what rules your state has about same-sex unions \u00bb . Duggan says that the court's decision was consistent with the findings of several lower courts in New York State. The governor's legal counsel sent the memo one day before the California Supreme Court struck down a ban on gay marriage in that state. Court officials in California counties may begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 17, state officials said Wednesday. Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriages in 2004, and gay couples need not be state residents there to wed. However, then-Gov. Mitt Romney resurrected a 1913 law barring non-resident marriages in the state if the marriage would be prohibited in the partners' home state. Subsequent court and agency decisions have determined that only residents of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Mexico may marry in Massachusetts, unless the parties say they plan to move there after the marriage. New Hampshire, Vermont, New Jersey and Connecticut permit civil unions, while California has a domestic-partner registration law. More than a dozen other states give same-sex couples some legal rights, as do some other countries.\n\nSummary:\nGov.

While data analytics used to be mainly performed on cloud infrastructures, the rapid development of IoT infrastructures and the requirements for low-latency, secure processing has motivated the development of edge analytics. Today, to balance various trade-offs, ML-based analytics tends to increasingly leverage an interconnected ecosystem that allows complex applications to be executed on hybrid infrastructures where IoT Edge devices are interconnected to Cloud/HPC systems in what is called the Computing Continuum, the Digital Continuum, or the Transcontinuum.Enabling learning-based analytics on\n\nText continuation:\nthese hybrid infrastructures requires advanced data processing and management capabilities, as well as robust security and networking solutions. This necessitates the development of new software frameworks and tools that can efficiently handle the complexities of distributed data processing, data fusion, and data analytics.\nOne such approach is the use of containerization and orchestration technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, to manage the deployment and scaling of ML workloads across hybrid infrastructures. These technologies enable the creation of portable, self-contained environments for ML applications, allowing them to be easily deployed and managed across different environments. Additionally, the use of cloud-native technologies, such as serverless computing and cloud-based data lakes, can provide scalable and cost-effective data processing and storage capabilities.\nAnother key aspect of enabling learning-based analytics on hybrid infrastructures is the development of advanced data processing and management capabilities. This includes the use of data streaming technologies, such as Apache Kafka and Apache Flink, to handle real-time data processing and analytics. Additionally, the use of distributed data processing frameworks, such as Apache Spark and Hadoop, can provide scalable and fault-tolerant data processing capabilities.\nFurthermore, the development of robust security and networking solutions is crucial for ensuring the secure processing and transmission of sensitive data across hybrid infrastructures. This includes the use of encryption technologies, such as SSL/TLS and AES, to protect data in transit and at rest. Additionally, the use of access control and authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth and Kerberos, can provide secure access to data and applications.\nIn conclusion, enabling learning-based analytics on hybrid infrastructures requires the development of advanced data processing and management capabilities, as well as robust security and networking solutions. By leveraging containerization and orchestration technologies, cloud-native technologies, data streaming technologies, distributed data processing frameworks, and robust security and networking solutions, organizations can create scalable, secure, and efficient hybrid infrastructures for ML-based analytics.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": ": Yes\n\nI have", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nText start", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": ": Yes", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

While data analytics used to be mainly performed on cloud infrastructures, the rapid development of IoT infrastructures and the requirements for low-latency, secure processing has motivated the development of edge analytics. Today, to balance various trade-offs, ML-based analytics tends to increasingly leverage an interconnected ecosystem that allows complex applications to be executed on hybrid infrastructures where IoT Edge devices are interconnected to Cloud/HPC systems in what is called the Computing Continuum, the Digital Continuum, or the Transcontinuum.Enabling learning-based analytics on\n\nText continuation:\nsuch complex infrastructures is challenging. The large scale and optimized deployment of learning-based workflows across the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum requires extensive and reproducible experimental analysis of the application execution on representative testbeds. This is necessary to help understand the performance trade-offs that result from combining a variety of learning paradigms and supportive frameworks. A thorough experimental analysis requires the assessment of the impact of multiple factors, such as: model accuracy, training time, network overhead, energy consumption, processing latency, among others.This review aims at providing a comprehensive vision of the main state-of-the-art libraries and frameworks for machine learning and data analytics available today. It describes the main learning paradigms enabling learning-based analytics on the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum. The main simulation, emulation, deployment systems, and testbeds for experimental research on the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum available today are also surveyed. Furthermore, we analyze how the selected systems provide support for experiment reproducibility. We conclude our review with a detailed discussion of relevant open research challenges and of future directions in this domain such as: holistic understanding of performance; performance optimization of applications;efficient deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) workflows on highly heterogeneous infrastructures; and reproducible analysis of experiments on the Computing Continuum.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " Yes.", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No.\n\nText start:\n"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nText start"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\nText start"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Additional metadata about shipped license files is also provided, making the dataset ready to use in various contexts, including: file length measures, MIME type, SPDX license (detected using ScanCode), and oldest appearance. The results of a manual analysis of 8102 documents is also included, providing a ground truth for further analysis. The dataset is released as open data as an archive file containing all deduplicated license files, plus several portable CSV files with metadata, referencing files via cryptographic checksums.Conclusions: Thanks to the extensive coverage of Software Heritage, the dataset presented in this paper covers a very large fraction of all software licenses for public code. We have assembled a large body of software licenses, characterized it quantitatively and qualitatively, and validated that it is mostly composed of licensing information and includes almost all known license texts. The dataset can be used to conduct empirical studies on open source licensing, training of automated license classifiers, natural language processing (NLP) analyses of legal texts, as well as historical and phylogenetic studies on FOSS licensing. It can also be used in practice to improve tools detecting licenses in source code.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\nI have"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": ": Yes\n\nI have", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Placing the packaged food in a water bath, with the temperature set at the desired final cooking temperature of the food, prevents overcooking, because the food cannot get hotter than the bath it is in, as in bain-marie.\nAs a result of precise temperature control of the bath and the fact that the bath temperature is the same as the target cooking temperature, very precise control of cooking can be achieved. Additionally, temperature, and thus cooking, can be very even throughout the food in sous vide cooking, even with irregularly shaped and very thick items, given enough time.\n\nSummary:\nBy contrast, in conventional high-heat cooking, such as oven roasting or grilling, the food is exposed to heat levels that are much higher than the desired internal cooking temperature, and it must be removed from the high heat prior to reaching the desired cooking temperature. If the food is removed from the heat too late, it becomes overcooked, and if it is removed too early, it is undercooked.\nThe use of temperatures much lower than those used for conventional cooking is an essential feature of sous vide. When cooking meat, tough collagen in connective tissue can be denatured into gelatin, without heating the meat's proteins high enough that they denature to a degree that the texture toughens and moisture is exuded from the meat.\nIn contrast, soft vegetables are often considered overcooked. Low-temperature cooking allows plant matter to remain more succulent, as the cell walls do not burst. Cooking vegetables at temperatures below the boiling point of water allows them to be thoroughly cooked (and pasteurized, if necessary) while maintaining a firm or somewhat crisp texture. While the cell walls will generally not burst, the depolymerization of the pectic polysaccharides that connect the vegetable cells together and the gelatinisation of starch in the vegetable can be achieved without overcooking.\nFrom a culinary viewpoint, the exclusion of air is secondary, but this has practical importance. It allows cooked food to be stored, still sealed and refrigerated, for considerable times, which is especially useful for the catering industry, and it excludes oxygen from food that requires long cooking and is susceptible to oxidation, e.g., fat on meat, which may become rancid with prolonged exposure to air. It also improves the transfer of heat between the water bath and food, without the thermal insulating properties of any trapped air in the bag.\nApart from ensuring uniform cooking, sous vide cooking facilitates development of desired organoleptic flavors and limits off flavors due to oxidation\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\".\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No\n\n\u2022 I"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ":"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

the latest available - the Vauxhall pension scheme had assets of about \u00a31.8bn but liabilities of about \u00a32.6bn, leaving a deficit of \u00a3840m.\nSince then record low interest rates have hit the returns on government debt in which big pension schemes invest heavily, so the deficit had probably grown, Mr Ralfe said.\nLast week it emerged that PSA Group, which also makes Citroen cars, was in talks about taking over GM's loss-making European business, Opel.\nMr Ralfe told Today the size of the deficit was a \"major issue for the takeover\". \"At best it's a stumbling block, at worst it could be a deal breaker,\" he said.\nHe said he was clear that PSA would not want to take on the pension scheme so they would only buy the operating assets, including the plant and the Vauxhall brand, leaving the pensions with General Motors UK.\n\"The trouble with that is that would then be a company with no assets, so what would have to happen ... is that General Motors US would have to issue a guarantee for that UK company,\" Mr Ralfe said.\nPSA, which already works with GM in Europe on several projects, said a takeover was among \"numerous strategic initiatives\" being considered.\nAny deal would involve Opel's UK arm, Vauxhall, which employs 4,500 staff at plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton.\nUnite union leader Len McCluskey is also due to meet Mr Tavares this week to discuss the deal and any impact it might have on jobs.\nMr Ralfe said he did not think the Vauxhall pensioners needed to be worried about their position, but said that while politicians were \"running around all over the place asking about jobs, they should also be running around asking about pensions\".\n\nSummary:\nThe proposed takeover of Vauxhall by PSA Group may be at risk due to a \u00a31 billion pension scheme deficit, which could be a \"deal breaker\" or a \"stumbling block\" for the deal.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"No\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"No\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"No\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": ": Yes\n\nArticle:\n", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": Yes\n\nI have"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": ": No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"No\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"No\"."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

She doesn\u2019t wear her hijab despite being harassed.\nyalitah: Bunch of insecure inherently misogynistic bums and pigs, she looks much happier than them. Shame on those judgemental bums\nlightknight7777: I think it's important to understand that these people grew up being fed these answers by the government. It's easy to get mad at them,  but they're victims too. I can't imagine not being able to appreciate women and yet their society saw fit to rob them of that through ignorance and misdirection. Women absolutely have it worse, but direct your anger at the government and programs that made them this way, first and foremost.\nSakuraba85: Would you say the same thing about Hitler?\nlightknight7777: Hitler formed the society that overthrew\n\nText continuation:\nthe values of empathy and compassion, and created an environment where hatred and prejudice were not only tolerated but encouraged. The people who followed him were victims of his propaganda and manipulation, but that doesn't excuse their actions. They were complicit in his crimes and should be held accountable.\nBut let's get back to Najmia and her bravery. She's not just a victim of harassment, but also a symbol of resistance against the oppressive forces that seek to control her and other women. Her refusal to wear the hijab is a powerful statement against the patriarchal society that seeks to dictate what she can and cannot wear.\nNajmia's story is not unique, there are many other women and girls around the world who are fighting against similar forms of oppression. They are the ones who are challenging the status quo, who are pushing against the boundaries of what is considered acceptable, and who are refusing to be silenced.\nBut Najmia's story is also a reminder that we must not forget the victims of oppression, we must not forget the ones who are still suffering under the weight of patriarchy and misogyny.

It's easy to get mad at them,  but they're victims too. I can't imagine not being able to appreciate women and yet their society saw fit to rob them of that through ignorance and misdirection.

I would say the children in Hitler youth were first generation victims. \nYou don't get to be a victim of the system when you installed it.\nWhat's more is a bully who was made a bully by the system is still a bully.  You can be a victim and also an asshole. You can be mad at Hitler and the environment that raised him. But Hitler had access to different viewpoints and picked the one he arrived at despite education. These kids don't have that luxury. When someone disagrees,  men with sticks show up and beat the hell out of them.\nSakuraba85: What do you mean? Hitler was shaped by his education and upbringing just like these men. \nHe grew up with being ashamed of how Germany acted and was treated after WW1 and was taught about that in school and his society.\nlightknight7777: The reason Hitler was evil wasn't him being mad at how Germany was treated.  It wasn't even him wanting to make Germany powerful again.  Conquerers have existed all throughout history without being known from then on as evil.  It was the \"genocide\" bit that made him the image of evil. Out of a plethora of perfectly viable options, he decided on concentration camps and murder. \nThere's a massive difference between being raised to think something bad is \"the truth\" vs specifically seeking out something bad to believe in from options. He arrived at his particular brand of insanity after significant research and adult social circles. You can be mad at him even having that path to come to. Heck, antisemitism was super common at the time (even in the US), but him going \"therefore let's remove them\" was  on him. Every other government was managing to not round them up and murder them.\nSakuraba85: Ok, i understand.

The Russian spacecraft that discovered it, Zond 3, was launched in 1965 and was designed to study the Moon's surface. The tower, which stands at an impressive height, has sparked widespread interest and speculation about its purpose and origin.\nSome experts believe that the tower could be a natural formation, created by geological processes over millions of years. Others think that it could be an artificial structure, built by an intelligent species. The possibility of extraterrestrial life is always a fascinating one, and the discovery of the tower has reignited interest in the search for life beyond Earth.\nMeanwhile, China's lunar rover, which is equipped with advanced sensors and cameras, is making its way to the tower. The rover is expected to transmit pictures and data back to Earth, which will help scientists to better understand the structure and its surroundings. The Chinese space agency has been making significant strides in recent years, and this mission is seen as a major milestone in its lunar exploration program.\nAs the world waits with bated breath for the rover's findings, the debate about the tower's origins continues to rage on. Some experts are skeptical about the possibility of extraterrestrial life, while others are more open-minded. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is certain - the discovery of the mysterious tower on the far side of the Moon has opened up a whole new frontier in space exploration and has sparked a renewed sense of wonder and curiosity about the universe.\n\nDid someone else write this?\n\nAnswer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nMy answer is", "answer_neut": " \"Yes\".", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No."}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No."}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No."}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No."}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No."}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No.\n\n\u2022 I'm"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No.\n\n\u2022 I'm"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " \"Yes\"."}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No."}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": " \"Yes\".", "answer_pos": " \"Yes\".", "answer_neg": " No."}}}, {"sentence": "Answer only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Is there something else?\nLGPlatinum: Man, just... Lat pulldown type movement. Or look up progressions. See if it's really easy for you. Scapula pull ups are great aswell. If you can't do more of those by leaning back a bit than you can do pull ups, you are arm dominant and need to fix that.\nBackanalia: If I am arm dominant, how do I fix it?\nLGPlatinum: Idk, try yourself.\nBackanalia: Do you know what exercises improve straight arm scapular strength?\nLGPlatinum: Scapula rows and pull ups.
