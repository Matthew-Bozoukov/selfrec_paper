Hillary Clinton rebounded from her third-place finish in last week's Iowa caucuses. Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent the past few days saying she has the experience to change Washington. She narrowly defeated Sen. Barack Obama in the New Hampshire primary, with 39 percent of the vote to Obama's 37. \"Last week, I listened to you, and in the process I found my own voice,\" the New York senator said after her victory. \"Now let's give America the kind of comeback that New Hampshire has just given me.\" Forty-three percent of self-styled independents said they voted for Obama, and 31 percent said they backed Clinton. Independents made up 43 percent of all voters polled. Addressing his roaring supporters after the race was called, Obama congratulated Clinton. But he was a candidate determined to draw a distinction between Clinton and himself. \"But the reason our campaign has always been different, the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago, is because it's not just about what I will do as president,\" he said. \"It is also about what you, the people who love this country, the citizens of the United States of America, can do to change it. That's what this election is all about.\" But Clinton was ahead of Obama 45 percent to 34 percent among those who said they were registered Democrats. Those voters made up a majority -- 54 percent -- of all respondents. Clinton also claimed the majority of women's votes, according to the polling. That's in contrast to last week's Iowa caucuses, in which Obama surprised observers by stealing the female vote from Clinton. Analysts say that shift among female voters was crucial to the Clinton turnaround. \"If I had a single word, the word would be 'women,' \" said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider. \"She got the women back.\" And Schneider said the support of union voters that put Clinton over the top. \"Union voters have her a 10 point lead,\" he said. CNN projected former Sen. John Edwards to finish third. College graduates, who made up 29 percent of the electorate, opted narrowly for Clinton -- 38 percent to Obama's 37 percent, according to the polling. Those polled who called themselves very liberal, and moderate, went with Clinton over Obama -- although by less than 2 percentage points in each -- and those who said they are somewhat liberal were evenly split. Pundits also were citing the role of former President Bill Clinton in helping his wife recover from what pre-primary polls were suggesting was a deficit of 9 percentage points to Obama in New Hampshire. The former president spent Tuesday in Hanover -- home to Dartmouth College -- where Obama had been expected to win handily. \"They dispatched him to the area that Obama was surging,\" said CNN analyst Donna Brazille, who managed former Vice President Al Gore's campaign in 2000. \"I think it had the effect of tamping down Obama support and giving Senator Clinton a real reason to come back in this race.\" New Hampshire was considered crucial to Clinton's campaign. If Obama had been able to sweep Iowa and New Hampshire -- after months of Clinton being considered the front-runner among Democrats -- it could have given him powerful momentum going into future primaries. \"Age is also playing a big factor -- older voters are overwhelmingly outnumbering younger voters -- a proportion that is clearly benefiting Clinton,\" Schneider said. \"Sixty-seven percent of Democratic primary voters are over the age of 40, and they are breaking heavily for Clinton over Obama.\" Over the past several days, Clinton has trumpeted her experience, saying that she has delivered change as both first lady and as a senator. After losing to Obama in last week's Iowa caucuses, it was unclear whether she could overcome what appeared to be Obama's ability to electrify American voters who had previously taken a sour and skeptical view of politicians and the political process. The duel between the Obama and Clinton campaigns grew especially testy Monday and Tuesday. She said she had more experience than he, and was therefore more qualified. He accused her of representing the status quo of Washington. And on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Bill Clinton criticized the media for not pressing Obama more fully on Iraq, and accused the Illinois senator of shifting his position to reflect changing attitudes about the war in Iraq. Then, there was an issue unto itself -- Hillary Clinton's almost-tears. Clinton's eyes welled up this week while responding to a voter's question about her health and appearance. Pundits and voters alike questioned whether Clinton's emotions were sincere or faked as part of some strategy to diminish criticism that she is too steely, too cold. In front of the crowd of mostly female New Hampshire voters, an admittedly fatigued Clinton responded to a question by saying: \"This is very personal for me, it's not just political, it's [that] I see what's happening, we have to reverse it.\" Her voice broke, and she was then applauded by the crowd. Polls indicated the show of emotions fared well with male voters, according to CNN's John King, but turned off some female voters. Edwards was followed in votes by New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich.

It's almost as if they've been exposed to heat or moisture at some point, causing them to deform. This warping makes it even harder to get the tiles to fit back into their grid squares, as they're not sitting flat.\nI'm considering using a bit of tape or adhesive to help hold the tiles in place while I work on the wiring, but I'm worried that this might leave residue or damage the tiles in some way.

Thanks for your time.\n[deleted]: before putting them back up, I've shaved a bit off the edges of the tiles with a utility knife and drywall square.  That way you don't have to go through all of this if you need to take the tiles back down.\nThose ceilings are a bitch, aren't they?\nSQLDave: Brilliant. It never dawned on me to actually remove them. Are they that easy to shave without messing up? I assume the drywall square is to ensure they remain as square as possible?\n[deleted]: yes.  I would use a brand new blade and score the tile several times to cut through it (don't do it all at once)\nSQLDave: OK, so when you originally said \"shave\", my mind envisioned a \"scraping\" kind of action... but it looks like you're really suggesting an actual cut (even though I'll probably only be removing, like, 1/8\" - 1/4\").\n[deleted]: I would say so, even scraping would be ok but I think you would have a rough edge.  If you really wanted it, you could run it through a table saw with a fine blade, but scoring it with a sharp utility knife should work fine. \nYou won't see it and it will still stay up there because of the track, know what I mean?  \nTo get it out first, you can run a putty along the edge next to the track and pry the panel out of there.

If you break a tile you can always buy a new one if Lowes or Home Depot has a match.\nI hate these ceilings but sometimes there is no other choice\nIs that helpful?\nSQLDave: Very helpful.

An extension method is a method declared in a package other than the package of its host class. Thanks to extension methods, developers can adapt to their needs classes they do not own: adding methods to core classes is a typical use case. This is particularly useful for adapting software and therefore to increase reusability. Inquiry. In most dynamically-typed languages, extension methods are globally visible. Because any developer can define extension methods for any class, naming conflicts occur: if two developers define an extension method with the same signature in the same class, only one extension method is visible and overwrites the other. Similarly, if two developers each define an extension method with the same name in a class hierarchy, one overrides the other. To avoid such\n\nText continuation:\nconflicts, many languages provide a way to qualify the extension method with a namespace or an alias, which helps to disambiguate the method name.\nTo further mitigate this issue, some languages also provide a way to explicitly specify the order in which extension methods are resolved. For example, in languages like C# and F#, extension methods can be marked as \"static\" or \"instance\" to indicate whether they should be resolved based on the static type or the runtime type of the object. This allows developers to control the order in which extension methods are called and reduces the likelihood of naming conflicts.\nIn addition to addressing naming conflicts, extension methods can also be used to provide a more intuitive and natural interface to a class. By adding methods that are semantically related to the class, developers can make the class more usable and easier to understand. For example, in a class that represents a bank account, an extension method could be added to calculate the interest earned on the account over a given period. This would make the class more intuitive and easier to use, as developers would not need to write custom code to perform this calculation.\nOverall, extension methods are a powerful tool for adapting software and increasing reusability. By providing a way to add methods to existing classes, they allow developers to create more intuitive and natural interfaces to those classes, while also reducing the likelihood of naming conflicts.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

However, their semantics have not been fully described and compared. In addition, these solutions typically rely on a dedicated and slow method lookup algorithm to resolve conflicts at runtime. Approach. In this article, we present a formalization of the underlying models of Ruby refinements, Groovy categories, Classboxes, and Method Shelters that are scoping extension method solutions in dynamically-typed languages. Knowledge. Our formal framework allows us to objectively compare and analyze the shortcomings of the studied solutions and other different approaches such as MultiJava. In addition, language designers can use our formal framework to determine which mechanism has less risk of \"accidental overrides\". Grounding.

You're right, the Rings Routine (RR) is a great resource and a solid foundation for ring training. However, I'm looking for something more comprehensive and advanced. I've already mastered the basics and want to take my training to the next level.\nAfter further research, I came across some other programs that caught my attention. One of them is the \"Ring Training\" program by Antraniks. It's a comprehensive guide that covers a wide range of exercises, including some advanced ones like the \"ring muscle-up\" and \"ring L-sit\". The program also includes a workout plan and progressive overload guidelines, which I find very helpful.\nAnother program that I'm considering is the \"Rings of Power\" by Dragon Door. This program is specifically designed for ring training and includes a variety of exercises that target different muscle groups. It also includes a workout plan and some advanced techniques for more experienced trainers.\nI'm also looking at the \"Overcoming Gravity\" program, which is a more holistic approach to training. It covers not only ring exercises but also other forms of strength training and conditioning. The program is designed to help you build overall strength and fitness, rather than just focusing on ring training.\nFinally, I'm considering the \"Body by Rings\" program, which is a more specialized program that focuses specifically on ring training. It includes a variety of exercises and a workout plan, as well as some advanced techniques for more experienced trainers.\nOverall, I'm looking for a program that will help me take my ring training to the next level and provide me with a comprehensive and well-rounded workout routine. I'm hoping that one of these programs will be the right fit for me.\nDo you have any experience with any of these programs, Jreced? Or do you have any other recommendations for me? I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on these programs.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Good luck choosing.\nBandatandWarrior: Do you mind if I ask why you wouldn't recommend anything by Dragon Door? I started using Convict Conditioning a month and a half ago and I'm seeing benefits. That said, I'm not the most athletic. I drank and smoked for years, so I'm gradually getting into body weight fitness. I'm genuinely curious though, as I've been doing it for such a short amount of time. I was going to supplement CC with the naked warrior as I heard good stuff. Any reasons why? I don't want to waste my money on an inferior product.\nThanks.\nJackofMA: If you choose to go Dragondoor, make sure you look at the Kindle versions on Amazon- not the PDF versions on the Dragondoor site. These are substantially cheaper than what is offered on the Dragondoor website for the paperback and for the Dragondoor PDF version. \nIn general, people are down on DD products because they are expensive with a lot of fluff. Full size pictures of one exercise when a smaller one would do. Huge margins and large type.\nThat being said- Naked Warrior is different from CC and may not offer what you are looking for. It focuses on techniques for tension to help you do one arm pushup and the pistol. Shows some progressions, but these boil down to manipulating height to make exercise easier. NW might help at the upper progressions of CC.\nWhether or not you get NW, do a search for Naked Warrior Bonus Material. One free pdf that comes up is for hanging leg raises. Pretty sure there is another one too. These are offered through the DD website, so it's not like you're downloading from some pirate site.\nBandatandWarrior: Thanks very much for the advice sir.\nAshamed to admit it but a month and a half in and I'm still on step one of the exercises. Since I turned 19 I let my fitness deteriorate badly. Only starting to get into it now as an outlet for my anxiety. Drives me crazy though because I boxed from 16 - 19 at an amateur level and used to be super fit. Anyway, thank you very much for taking time out of your day to comment. Have a good one.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Silent Hill 2 centers on widower James Sunderland who travels to the titular town after receiving a letter from his dead wife, while Silent Hill 3 is a direct sequel to the first Silent Hill game and focuses on Heather Mason, a teenager who finds herself in conflict with the town's cult. Both games are categorized as survival horror and share gameplay elements with each other. Published worldwide by Konami beginning with North America in March 2012, the compilation features a graphics overhaul, new voice acting, and Xbox achievements and PlayStation trophies.\nThe Silent Hill HD Collection\n\nText continuation:\nwas in development for more than two years. The development team had to work with incomplete source code provided by Konami, as the published source code had not been archived. This consequently resulted in their having to fix technical issues both arising from porting the two games and those that the original development team had previously dealt with. An arrangement was eventually reached between the original voice actors of Silent Hill 2 and Konami to allow for an option to have the original voice acting present in Silent Hill 2's port, although the Silent Hill 3 port does not have that option. Critics were divided over the Silent HD Collection, particularly in regards to its updated graphics and voice acting. Some enjoyed it as an updated presentation of two favorably regarded games, while others criticized the quality of the compilation, citing the technical issues.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

He previously served as the 26th Prime Minister of Turkey from 1983 to 1989 as the leader of the Motherland Party. He was the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey in the military government of B\u00fclend Ulusu between 1980 and 1982.\nAfter working briefly at the World Bank in the United States and as a university lecturer, \u00d6zal became the general secretary and later the leader of the main miners' trade union of Turkey in 1979, serving as a chief negotiator during large-scale industrial action in 1977. He unsuccessfully stood for Parliament in the 1977 general election as a National\n\nText continuation:\nSalvation Party candidate. \u00d6zal's experience in the trade union movement and his involvement in industrial action gave him a strong understanding of the working class and the struggles they faced, which would later influence his policies as Prime Minister and President.\n\u00d6zal's entry into politics was marked by his election as the leader of the Motherland Party in 1983, which was a newly formed party that aimed to challenge the dominant political parties in Turkey. As Prime Minister, \u00d6zal implemented a series of economic reforms aimed at liberalizing the Turkish economy and attracting foreign investment. He also pursued a policy of reconciliation with Greece, which had been a major foreign policy issue in Turkey for decades. \u00d6zal's government also implemented a number of social and cultural reforms, including the establishment of a new university system and the introduction of a new penal code.\nAs President, \u00d6zal continued to pursue his economic and social reforms, and also played a key role in the country's foreign policy. He was a strong supporter of Turkey's membership in the European Union and worked closely with European leaders to advance Turkey's bid for membership. \u00d6zal also played a key role in the country's relations with the Middle East, particularly with Iran and Iraq. He was a strong advocate for Turkish-Iranian cooperation and worked to strengthen the two countries' economic and cultural ties.\n\u00d6zal's legacy in Turkey is complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, he is remembered for his economic reforms, which helped to transform Turkey's economy and make it more competitive in the global market. He is also remembered for his efforts to promote social and cultural change, including the establishment of a new university system and the introduction of a new penal code. On the other hand, \u00d6zal's government was also marked by controversy and criticism, particularly with regards to his handling of the Kurdish issue and his relationship with the military. Despite these controversies, \u00d6zal remains one of the most important and influential figures in Turkish politics in the second half of the 20th century.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In 1979, he became an undersecretary to Prime Minister S\u00fcleyman Demirel's minority government until the 1980 military coup. As an undersecretary, he played a major role in developing economic reforms, known as the '24 January decisions,' which paved the way for greater neoliberalism in the Turkish economy. After the coup, he was appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey responsible for the economy in B\u00fclend Ulusu's government and continued to implement economic reforms. He resigned in 1982 following disagreements over economic policy.\u00d6zal formed the Motherland Party (ANAP) in 1983 after the ban on political parties was lifted by the military government. ANAP won a parliamentary majority in the 1983 general election and \u00d6zal subsequently became the Prime Minister of Turkey. While implementing several economic reforms concerning the exchange rate and deregulation, a rise in inflation and the growing conflict with Kurdish separatists led to ANAP winning reduced pluralities in the 1984 local elections. Despite a referendum in 1987 allowing politicians banned during the 1980 coup to resume political activities, ANAP was re-elected with a parliamentary majority in the 1987 general election, albeit with a reduced share of the vote. He survived an assassination attempt during a party congress in 1988. \u00d6zal's foreign policy focused on averting war with Greece following the \u015eim\u015fek Incident and temporarily allowed Bulgarian Turks to emigrate to Turkey.\n\u00d6zal was elected President of the Turkish Republic in the 1989 presidential election, while Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Akbulut replaced him as Prime Minister. Despite assuming a ceremonial role with minimal political duties, \u00d6zal remained occupied with government activities, such as intervening in the 1990 Zonguldak miners' strikes. While Akbulut took a docile approach as Prime Minister, disputes over the President's and Prime Minister's duties were dominant when S\u00fcleyman Demirel became Prime Minister after the 1991 general election. The Southeastern Anatolia development project began with the construction of the Atat\u00fcrk Dam in \u015eanl\u0131urfa, while \u00d6zal participated in the first ever summit of Turkic Republics in 1992 held in Ankara. He maintained close relations with the President of the United States George H. W. Bush during the Gulf War and the end of the Cold War. \u00d6zal died unexpectedly while in office in 1993, with an exhumation in 2012 leading to evidence of poisoning but the cause of death was unclear.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I have to explain old people to young people, and explain young people to old people.\nSupreme0verl0rd: And weirdly I seem to be more in touch with a lot of internet and tech stuff than many of my close friends that are 8-10 years younger than me.\ngraybuilder: I have noticed it as well. Maybe because our generation was faced with clunky UI and everything was new so we always were looking at the next tech coming up.\nterminalmemelocity: Maybe because tech didn't just get handed to us\n\nText continuation:\nAs I read through the comments, I couldn't help but nod in agreement. The Xennial generation, born between the late 1970s and early 1980s, is indeed a unique breed. We grew up in a time when analog and digital coexisted, when cassette tapes and VHS players were the norm, but we also witnessed the dawn of the internet and mobile phones.\nAs a 38-year-old, I've had to navigate the complexities of explaining old people to young people, and vice versa. It's a delicate balance, one that requires a deep understanding of both the past and the present. But what's interesting is that, despite being part of the \"older\" generation, I've found myself more in touch with the latest internet trends and tech advancements than many of my younger friends.\nMaybe it's because our generation was forced to adapt to new technology at a slower pace. We didn't have the luxury of growing up with smartphones or social media; we had to learn to navigate the digital world through trial and error. And as a result, we developed a unique perspective on technology \u2013 one that's both nostalgic and forward-thinking.\ngraybuilder's comment about clunky UI resonated with me. Remember the early days of the internet, when websites were slow to load and graphics were pixelated? It was a frustrating experience, but it also forced us to be more resourceful and patient. We learned to appreciate the little things, like the thrill of discovering a new website or the satisfaction of finally figuring out how to use a new software.\nterminalmemelocity's comment about tech not being handed to us also struck a chord. We didn't have the luxury of being spoon-fed technology; we had to work for it. We had to learn to troubleshoot, to problem-solve, and to adapt to new situations. And as a result, we developed a deeper appreciation for the value of technology and the importance of continuous learning.\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I realize that being an Xennial has its advantages. We're not stuck in the past, but we're also not completely lost in the present. We have a unique perspective on technology, one that's rooted in both nostalgia and innovation. And as we navigate the complexities of the digital world, I believe that our generation will continue to play a vital role in shaping the future of technology.\nBut what does it mean to be an Xennial? Is it a badge of honor, a symbol of our unique experiences and perspectives? Or is it simply a label, a way to categorize and understand our place in the world?

Like they would all be these leet coders who left us old fucks behind but it turns out they're just as useless as my generation.  Nothing changed much.  Like you said if you're handed a phone, sure you can Instagram and Facebook but it doesn't mean you can set up a VCR\nIm_not_billy: I don't even know what a VCR is\nThatSquareChick: Video Cassette Recorder. You put big cartridges into these machines and they recorded whatever was on your tv screen. They used magnetic tape which degraded over time and use and often your tapes would go into the VCR and only back out trailing the brown/black tape hopelessly tangled and twisted. This killed the tape and whatever was on it. Since the Internet wasn\u2019t a thing, something recorded was maybe the only recording. Maybe you were the only one who taped 120 seconds of an Eek! The Cat episode where Sharky goes to therapy and it looks like he\u2019s on acid. Lots of shows got cancelled and never aired second times. Movies came out years after they premiered in theaters, pay tv channels would come unscrambled, cousin Becky\u2019s wedding, they all needed tapes and the VCR was the magical machine you hooked your TV to play and record them. Hand held recorders didn\u2019t even go straight from the recorder to the VCR either, you needed an adapter and not every VCR could play home recorded tapes. Sometimes the adapter ate the tape inside the cassettes too and therefore cousin Becky\u2019s wedding, where only one person could afford a camera, would be lost forever. Sometimes something would come on TV that was super important and a random tape would be grabbed to record it. Later on, you would horrifyingly find out that you accidentally taped over the wedding, birth or other important family event or, even worse, another taped thing that was your favorite or part of a series. You\u2019d forever have a tape where after the credits started to roll on Terminator you\u2019d see five minutes of cousin Becky in her wedding dress before it would jerk into the opening for He-Man.\nAh those were such chaotic times, where all digital information was fragile and fleeting. I kind of miss it.\nCrowlives: Yeah, but if you popped out the plastic tab, it wouldn\u2019t record over it.\nHowever, you could put a piece of tape over the missing tab to record on it again.\nbdlcalichef: BetaMax was the superior format\nNotMyHersheyBar: too expensive and actually physically heavy. it can't just be clear, it has to meet the market's needs.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

They were believed to have been focusing their attention on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign chair Paul Manafort, among others.\nAs it turns out, the first bit of concrete public evidence that someone in the president's inner circle might be open to Russian assistance in the presidential election involved Mr Trump's eldest son.\nThe president, Trump Jr and his administration have quickly reformed their defences and are now dismissing the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June as a minor event during a hurly-burly political season, largely lost in the fog of time, that led to nothing and which they have been admirably \"transparent\" in discussing.\nKey members of Congress seem to think otherwise, with senators like Republican Susan Collins of Maine calling for Trump Jr to be questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa eager to bring Manafort before his Senate Judiciary Committee.\nBut while Congress gears up for more hearings, Mr Mueller operates quietly behind the scenes. Where might he look first? What threads, revealed in Trump Jr's emails, will he and his team tug on, to see what unravels?\nHere are a few of the tempting questions he might be tempted to ask.\nNestled toward the end of music publicist Goldstone's explosive first email to Trump Jr about the \"official documents and information\" the Russian government supposedly had about Hillary Clinton was that this constituted just \"part of\" Russia's support for his father, \"helped along by Aras and Emin\" Agalarov, the father-son Moscow-based real estate duo.\nIt's a rather stunning detail for Goldstone to have offhandedly mentioned - and one that Trump Jr, in his \"love it\" response, seems to have breezed past with no comment.\nThat kind of remark, however, would cause anyone looking for evidence of a Trump-Russia campaign collusion to stop dead in their tracks and ask: \"What's the rest of the story?\"\nWhy is this British guy emailing Trump Jr?\nEven if one takes Veselnitskaya at her word that she is not an agent of the Russian government and did not know or provide any damaging information about Mrs Clinton to the Trump team during the 9 June meeting, her own recent admissions raise some pressing questions.\nOn Tuesday she told an NBC interviewer that Trump Jr, Manafort and Kushner may have been \"longing for\" the dirt on their Democratic opponent.\n\"They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted,\" she said.\nIn other words, Veselnitskaya walked out of that meeting in New York with the belief that Mr Trump's campaign both was desperately seeking damaging information about Mrs Clinton and were open to talking to Russian nationals about what they might have to offer.\nGiven that Veselnitskaya is at the very least a well-connected figure in Moscow, it doesn't require a great leap of faith to think this information eventually made its way to the Russian government. If the US intelligence community is to be believed, that government soon would acquire a trove of damaging information about Mrs Clinton and the Democrats as a result of hacks it co-ordinated into the Democratic National Committee server and the personal email of a senior member of Mrs Clinton's campaign team.\nIn the ensuing months, details from those hacks would be made public via Wikileaks at times that were particularly damaging to Mrs Clinton.\nDerogatory statements about Mrs Clinton's Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders were produced the week before Democrats gathered for their national convention.

The Russian government had it in spades.

He didn't stop.\nUser 2: What did you do?\nUser 1: I didn't do anything. Finally, he left. But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's. But then he came in too.\nUser 2: Did he leave when you left?\nUser 1: Yes. Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me. He was following me.\nUser 2: What did you do?\nUser 1: He followed me all the way home\n\nText continuation:\n. I didn't know what to do, so I just kept walking and tried to stay calm. But now that I'm home, I'm shaking like a leaf. I don't know what to do, Doris. I'm so scared.\nDoris: Oh, sweetie, don't worry. We'll figure something out. Have you talked to the police about this?\nUser 1: No, I didn't think it was serious enough. But now I'm not so sure. Do you think I should report it?\nDoris: Absolutely. We need to take this seriously. I'll go with you to the police station and we can file a report together.\nUser 1: Okay, that sounds like a good idea. But what if he finds out I reported him? What if he gets angry?\nDoris: We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let's just focus on getting you safe and getting the police involved.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

He just stood there. It was so obvious. What should I do? I'm so scared. Can I call the police?\nUser 2: Actually, I don't think you can call the police. Not yet at least. He hasn't done anything.

What can they do? I don't even know who he is.\nUser 2: Listen, Carol. Don't let this bother you too much. Probably it's nothing. Just keep your eyes open when you go out. If you see him a third time, and if he follows you again, then I think we should go to the police.

And just like her chart career, her marriage to Carl Dean turned 50 this year.\n\"I thought, well, this would be a good year to write an album of love songs,\" she says. \"I've never done that before. I've usually had a story song or a gospel song, but this was all love stories.\"\nThe BBC caught up with the star to discuss the new record, her legendary Glastonbury set, and why she admires Adele.\nFirst of all, congratulations on celebrating your golden wedding anniversary!\nThank you so much. That's a long time to do anything, ain't it? Especially to be married.\nWhat's the secret?\nWe've always been good buddies. We have a lot of fun and a lot of respect for one another. It was his first marriage and mine and we never thought we'd ever want to do that again. Why bother?\nYou renewed your vows earlier this year. What was that like?\nThat was sweet. There was no pressure at all. We had our own little ceremony in a little chapel on our property, then we went in our little RV down to Ringgold, Georgia, and spent the night where we had married 50 years before. We took some beautiful pictures and got all dressed up. It was fun really.\nDid you wear your original wedding dress? Could you still fit into it?\nWell, I could but I don't know where it is now! I only had a simple little white dress that my mother had made for me for that wedding, but I had always wanted a beautiful, long, beaded wedding gown, so I dressed completely to the nines. I made a right nice bride!\nThat sense of romance permeates your new album.\nOh yes! In fact a lot of the songs were written just because of that.\nYou've written so many love songs over the years - how do you find new ways to talk about it?\nLove is always growing, and we grow as people as well, so you just automatically take on new twists and turns. And it's amazing. I've always been amazed by that myself, how people can just write, year in and year out, about love and it all is different. I could write one right now!\nHow often do you write?\nI write something almost every single day unless I'm sick or on a movie set.\nIs that ever an inconvenience? Do you ever find yourself going, \"I don't have time to write a song right now, I need to finish this casserole?\"\nWell, no! In fact, I write a lot when I cook. If my cooking's really good that day, my songs are really good.\nIn Head Over High Heels, you sing about \"painting my eyes like Adele.\" What made you write about her?\nEveryone loves Adele. With all my little nieces, it's all \"Adele this\" and \"Adele that!\" And I love how she does her make-up, and so I'm always saying to my little nieces, \"can you fix my eyes like Adele?\"\nWhen I started that song, I had not planned to write that line. I was just thinking, \"This needs to be about a girl dressing up sexy, so she's got to have some make-up, and she's got to paint her eyes\". And all of a sudden it's like, \"And my eyes like Adele!\"\nWhat do you think her reaction will be?\nI think she'll have to be complimented, just like I'm always complimented when people write songs about me!\nI just meant I wanted to look like Adele. I hope she thinks it's cute.\nYou both like to talk to your audience in between songs, but she swears a lot more than you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I wondered what you made of that?\nOh, I don't pay any attention to that! Words are just an exchange, like money. I don't think the Lord holds that against us. I think that's just the way we communicate. And some people are just born cussers.\nWhat's the worst thing you've ever said on stage?\nOh, I've never said anything real bad. I try to respect the audience.\nThe song I'm 16 is based on one of your sisters, is that right?\nYeah, she had a couple of bad relationships and she thought it wasn't meant for her to have true love. Then all of a sudden, in her 60s, she met someone and they fell in love, and it's just like they were born again. It's just the sweetest thing.\nAnother one of my sisters and I were laughing. We said, \"Look at her, she thinks she's 16!\" and all of a sudden I heard the song in my head.\nGoes to show you're never old unless you choose to be.\nWhat age do you think of yourself as?\nI'm 16 in some ways. I'm still a hopeless romantic! But I'm 35 in my spirit and in my mind. When I was 35, it was a pinnacle, a great time in my life - success and happiness and all that. And so I just decided \"I'm gonna claim that number and always be that in my state of mind.\"\nWhat inspired Can't Be That Wrong?\nThat was an easy one to write. I think it's the ultimate cheating song.\nI based it on someone very, very close to me, who was very much in love with the person at home, and their children, and they weren't looking for love, they just happened to fall for someone. They were so torn, because they loved both people. I saw the turmoil and the heartache, and how overwhelming and overpowering it was. And I just thought, \"That's a strong-ass love, right there\". You know, to be willing to go through all you have to, and put the other people through that. So I thought, \"wow, this would make a great song.\"\nThe last time I saw you on stage in the UK was at Glastonbury - and you've put that concert on this album as a bonus disc. What are your memories of it?\nThat'll be one of my greatest memories, actually. That'll be a real highlight in my career.\nI wasn't even certain about doing that show, because I didn't know if I was the type of artist that would fit in that type of a festival - because people are rowdy, they like to go dancing, and they like to drink and smoke and I thought, \"I wonder if they're even going to pay attention?\"\nAnd so, as soon as I went out and I saw the crowd and heard the roar, I thought, \"Ohhhh, my Lord, how did I miss this all these years?\"\nThey call that part of the day the \"legends slot\". If you were booking next year's Glastonbury, who would you put in there?\nI don't know. I hadn't even thought about it in those terms. Probably Adele.\nBut I'm not sure I'd do it again, because I don't know how I could ever top that.\nPure and Simple is out now on RCA Records.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.\n\nSummary:\nCountry music legend Dolly Parton releases her new album \"Pure & Simple\", featuring romantic songs inspired by her 50th wedding anniversary and her legendary Glastonbury performance.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

If not, what's wrong with that? Hypertrophy is the goal btw\nwerdiser: Not a bad idea to do a regression as super sets. After a paired set (such as weighed pulls and dips), I occasionally will add a little volume at the end with a couple sets of regular pulls / dips. I do them after I finish the main part of the workout so it doesn't affect my other pair (rows / pushups)\n592dan: Decline, pseudo, dips, pike are the main exercises in my push routine. So you could say the diamonds and wide are a regression\nwerdiser: Yea, if your main goal is hypertrophy then I would still recommend doing those extra sets after your main strength focused exercises.\nI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re doing RR but if time becomes a factor maybe a Push/Pull split might work better for you?\n592dan: They're all hypertrophy focused.

The use of computational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single ventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of pacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the biomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing in clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In practice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each other's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD) the main steps involved in performing\n\nText continuation:\ncomputational simulations.\nThe first step is to define the problem and identify the specific clinical question being addressed. This requires a thorough understanding of the patient's anatomy and physiology, as well as the relevant clinical data. Next, the computational model is developed, which involves creating a digital representation of the patient's heart and blood vessels. This is typically done using specialized software and involves a range of techniques, including finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics.\nOnce the model is developed, it can be used to simulate various scenarios and predict the outcomes of different treatments. This allows clinicians to test different approaches and make informed decisions about the best course of action. The simulations can also be used to identify potential complications and develop strategies for mitigating them.\nIn addition to its clinical applications, computational simulation can also be used to advance our understanding of the underlying biology of congenital heart disease. For example, simulations can be used to study the effects of genetic mutations on heart development and function, or to investigate the role of environmental factors in the development of CHD.\nOverall, the use of computational simulation in the study of congenital heart disease has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach diagnosis and treatment. By providing a powerful tool for predicting outcomes and identifying potential complications, simulations can help clinicians make more informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The use of computational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single ventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of pacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the biomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing in clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In practice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each other's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD) the main steps involved in performing\n\nText continuation:\ncomputational simulation-from the selection of an appropriate clinical question/problem to understanding the computational results, and all of the \"black boxes\" in between. We examine the current state of the art and areas in need of continued development. For example, medical image-based model-building software has been developed based on numerous different methods. However, none of them can be used to construct a model with a simple \"click of a button\". The creation of a faithful, representative anatomic model, especially in pediatric subjects, often requires skilled manual intervention. In addition, information from a second imaging modality is often required to facilitate this process. We describe the technical aspects of model building, provide a definition of some of the most commonly used terms and techniques (e.g. meshes, mesh convergence, Navier-Stokes equations, and boundary conditions), and the assumptions used in running the simulations. Particular attention is paid to the assignment of boundary conditions as this point is of critical importance in the current areas of research within the realm of congenital heart disease. Finally, examples are provided demonstrating how computer simulations can provide an opportunity to \"acquire\" data currently unobtainable by other modalities, with essentially no risk to patients. To illustrate these points, novel simulation examples of virtual Fontan conversion (from preoperative data to predicted postoperative state) and outcomes of different surgical designs are presented. The need for validation of the currently employed techniques and predicted results are required and the methods remain in their infancy. While the daily application of these technologies to patient-specific clinical scenarios likely remains years away, the ever increasing interest in this area among both clinicians and engineers makes its eventual use far more likely than ever before and, some could argue, only a matter of [computing] time.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In biomedical devices, IPMC-based energy harvesters could be used to power implantable devices, such as pacemakers or cochlear implants, eliminating the need for batteries and reducing the risk of complications.\nFurthermore, we are also investigating the possibility of using IPMC-based systems in energy storage and conversion applications. For example, IPMC-based supercapacitors could be used to store electrical energy generated by renewable sources, such as solar or wind power, and release it when needed. Additionally, IPMC-based fuel cells could be used to convert chemical energy into electrical energy, providing a clean and efficient source of power for vehicles and other applications.\nOverall, the potential applications of IPMC-based systems are vast and varied, and we are excited to continue exploring the possibilities of this technology and its potential to revolutionize various fields.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The central part of the device consists in two interpenetrating polymers playing the role of an ions reservoir. The PEDOT is polymerized on each side and forms an interpenetrating network with the two other polymers. A pseudo trilayer is obtained, the two outer layers containing the PEDOT acting as electrodes. It is then saturated with an ionic liquid. When the blade thus obtained is placed in an electric field orthogonal to its faces, the PEDOT undergoes a reduction reaction (or dedoping) on the side of the negative electrode, which attracts cations from the central part and therefore swells ; the blade ultimately bends towards the positive electrode.We have first adapted our model to this two-components system : the cations on the one hand, and the three polymers and the anions on the other hand. We have written its balance equations and thermodynamic relations first at the microscopic scale for each phase, then at the macroscopic scale for the whole material using an averaging technique. The thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes then provides its constitutive relations : a Kelvin - Voigt type stress-strain relation and generalized Fourier's and Darcy's laws. The equations obtained were applied to the case of a cantilevered blade subject to a continuous potential difference at constant temperature. The numerical resolution of the equations system enabled us to draw the profiles of the different quantities, which are very steep functions near the electrodes. We also evaluated the tip displacement and the force that must be exerted on the free end of the beam to prevent its displacement (blocking force). The results obtained are in good agreement with the experimental data published in the literature.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Firefighters in a Paris suburb battle to control a blaze started after youths rioted Sunday night. An angry mob repeatedly clashed with riot police and torched cars and buildings in the town of Villiers-le-Bel, north of Paris, after two teens on a motorcycle were killed following a collision with a police car Sunday night. Rioters bombarded police with baseball bats, Molotov cocktail bombs and bottles filled with acid as the violence spread to the nearby towns of Longjumeau and Grigby Monday night. The 15- and 16-year-old boys, both sons of African immigrants, according to police, died when their motorbike hit a patrol car in Villiers-le-Bel. Some residents, populated largely by immigrants and their French-born children, accused police of fleeing the crash scene. However, three eyewitnesses, interviewed on TV, said the police stayed and tried to revive the two boys with mouth to mouth resuscitation.  Watch why a repeat of past rioting is feared \u00bb . More than 60 police officers were injured in Monday night's confrontation, with five kept in hospital in a serious condition, according to reports in a number of French newspapers. A spokesman for the police authorities in the Val d'Oise prefecture refused to confirm the numbers of police injuries, telling CNN that police feared the information could further enflame the already tense situation. The police spokesman said 60 cars, a library and car dealer's showroom had been set on fire in Villiers-le-Bel. He said a police station had also been damaged and 15 garbage cans torched. Security was tightened Tuesday, with helicopters deployed to patrol over the town, the spokesman said. Villiers-le-Bel was not among the districts hit by the weeks of nationwide rioting in November 2005, when disaffected youths nationwide set thousands of cars ablaze to protest against unemployment and discrimination. Those riots were also sparked by fatalities, namely the deaths of two men of North African descent who were electrocuted while hiding from police in an electrical substation. French president Nicolas Sarkozy, then serving as the interior minister, provoked controversy at the time by referring to the rioters as \"scum.\" Sarkozy, currently on a state visit to China, had urged residents Monday to \"cool down and let the justice system determine who is responsible for what.\" A spokesman for the president's office told CNN Tuesday they were continuing to monitor the situation. The prosecutor's office in the nearby town of Pontoise has already begun an inquiry into the deaths. Police said the teens drove through a red light without wearing helmets and on an unregistered bike. But Omar Sehhouli, the brother of one of the victims, told French media the police involved should be arrested. \"Everyone knew the two boys here,\" he told French radio. \"What happened, that's not violence, it's rage.\" According to the initial findings from the French police watchdog, reported Tuesday in the daily newspaper, Le Figaro, the boy's motorbike was driving \"at very high speed\" and had failed to give priority to the police patrol vehicle. The police car was driving normally at around 40 kilometers an hour, the newspaper reported the watchdog had found. E-mail to a friend .

The \"Barbie Bandits\" helped their hometown earn the dubious distinction as the nation's bank robbery capital. Here one of the so-called \"Barbie Bandits\" is captured on surveillance video at a surburban Atlanta bank. Atlanta's FBI field division topped Los Angeles in reporting the most bank heists, with 350 for the 12 months ending September 30, 2007, according to the FBI, which annually names areas most prone to bank robberies. The Los Angeles area was No. 2 with 338 heists, followed by Philadelphia with 316. Just Thursday, two suspects overpowered a security guard at an Atlanta, Georgia, bank, took his gun, robbed the bank and fled with money in hand, police said. Eventually, police shot one of the suspects in an exchange of gunfire. Two more armed bank robberies took place in metro Atlanta Friday. The FBI says violent crime is up across the nation, especially in major metro areas like Atlanta. So it's no surprise Atlanta has become a prime target for bank robberies, FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett told CNN.  Watch Hotlanta or Heistlanta? \u00bb . \"This goes hand in hand with those figures,\" Emmett said. Atlanta's rapid growth over the last decade has also been a factor. A recent Atlanta Business Chronicle article reported that metro Atlanta has 26 more banks than in all of North Carolina -- roughly one bank for every 3,500 people in the region.  See photos of bank heists in metro Atlanta \u00bb . \"We would attribute a lot of that [bank robberies] to the growth and the fact that the banking industry has matched that growth with an increase in bank branches throughout the area,\" Emmett said. Atlanta's rise in bank heists comes just as Los Angeles has aggressively countered once out-of-control bank robberies. Los Angeles has gone from more than 500 bank robberies in the mid-2000s to this year's 338, the FBI stats show. According to the FBI, its Atlanta field division reported 350 bank robberies in the last year -- the most notorious of which were the \"Barbie Bandits\" and \"Grandpa Bandit\" robberies. The FBI says 122 of the heists were armed robberies, or robberies where a weapon was visibly used. Emmett said many more of the robberies were what law enforcement officers classify as \"note jobs\" -- where a robber gestures as if he or she has a gun on them in a demand note handed over to the teller. Also factored into the total number of robberies were ATM heists and a record nine armored car robberies. Those armored car robberies are particularly disturbing to Emmett. \"Anyone that would confront an armored car courier knowing that he's already armed and in somewhat of a defensive posture, that mindset is very troubling for law enforcement,\" he said. While Emmett said there is no \"typical\" bank robber, he said he has seen some trends, most notably that they are often people battling drug addictions. He also said bank robbers are often repeat offenders. Two recent high-profile cases in Atlanta seem to confirm that. Two women dubbed the \"Barbie Bandits\" were arrested after working with a bank employee to rob a Bank of America in the Atlanta suburb of Acworth. They both later admitted to police to having drug addiction problems. Recently apprehended 69-year-old Bobby Joe Phillips, dubbed the \"Grandpa Bandit,\" is suspected to have robbed seven banks in Tennessee and the Atlanta area and had a criminal history. Emmett says typically very little money is taken in a bank heist. Joe Brannen, president of the Georgia Bankers Association, agrees, saying \"the average is $2,000 to $3,000. It's not as big a payoff as most people think it is.\" With the holidays in full swing, authorities are steeling themselves for a spate of bank robberies with robbers looking for quick holiday cash. \"I would make the assumption that a large part of it is the increased [financial] pressures this time of year,\" said Brannen. The FBI advises banks to be extra vigilant this time of year and to keep a close eye on jittery individuals donning gloves, hats and sunglasses. But Brannen says profiling people like that can be problematic. \"We've chosen not to go there. Here in Atlanta, lots of people wear head coverings for religious purposes. This is a free and open society,\" he said. He said customers want to come into a bank unimpeded -- that 99.9 percent are just customers, not bank robbers. Brannen says banks do all they can to balance convenience for their customers and the bank's need for security. \"There is no good, magic solution.\" he says. Emmett said as long as metro Atlanta continues to grow, so will the number of bank robberies. \"This is something that is part of growth. We have more banks. We have more people. We're a big city now.\" E-mail to a friend .

Gane stated that he had invited sole permanent NWW member Steven Stapleton to produce Stereolab's debut album (later released as Peng!). However, Gane stated that Stapleton had refused on the grounds that the group were \"too rock\" but had agreed to undertake a remix for the group instead. Stapleton surprised Gane by producing a letter he had written to NWW some years previously, which he had marked as the 15th\n\nText continuation:\n.\nThe letter, it seemed, was a challenge to the band to create a piece of music that would push the boundaries of their sound and challenge their audience. Stapleton, known for his experimental approach to music, wanted to see how far Stereolab would be willing to push themselves in response to his challenge. The result was Crumb Duck, a 10-minute piece of music that defied categorization and left listeners bewildered. The track featured a combination of distorted guitars, haunting vocals, and unconventional instrumentation, all woven together to create a sonic tapestry that was both challenging and captivating.\nDespite the initial shock of hearing Crumb Duck, Stereolab and NWW fans alike were drawn to the track's innovative sound and the way it seemed to blur the lines between different musical genres. The track's release on 10\" vinyl was a limited edition, but it quickly became a sought-after collector's item among fans of experimental music. Today, Crumb Duck remains a cult classic, a testament to the power of collaboration and the willingness of artists to take risks and push the boundaries of their creativity.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

According to a newsletter issued by Stereolab's Duophonic Records, part of the agreement was that Stereolab would not get to hear the finished results until after the record had been pressed and released.\"Exploding Head Movie\" is a Stapleton remix of a section of the 18-minute album version of the \"Jenny Ondioline\" single (as heard on Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements). \"Animal or Vegetable (A Wonderful Wooden Reason ......)\" saw Stapleton playing the vocal track in reverse and adding several layers of wild distorted guitar to the lengthy middle section before applying his familiar tape collage methods to the coda. The original version of this track has not been released. An homage to the German group Faust is provided by the subtitle to \"Animal or Vegetable\" \u2013 \"A Wonderful Wooden Reason.\" The latter references a line from the lyrics of \"Meadow Meal,\" a track on Faust's first album self-titled Faust (1971). Stapleton provided the distinctive cover image but around 30 copies came with sleeves hand drawn by members of Stereolab.\nStereolab later included both tracks on their Refried Ectoplasm compilation which remains in print. NWW, for their part, issued a Crumb Duck CD, adding 2 tracks from a 7\" single NWW had previously issued on the Clawfist label and an outtake. A vinyl edition of this expanded reissue was also made available but both formats went out of print when NWW's distributor, World Serpent Distribution, went out of business. NWW also included \"Animal Or Vegetable\" on their The Swinging Reflective compilation.\nThey would collaborate a second time in 1997 with the release of Simple Headphone Mind.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Shame on those judgemental bums\nlightknight7777: I think it's important to understand that these people grew up being fed these answers by the government. It's easy to get mad at them,  but they're victims too. I can't imagine not being able to appreciate women and yet their society saw fit to rob them of that through ignorance and misdirection. Women absolutely have it worse, but direct your anger at the government and programs that made them this way, first and foremost.\nSakuraba85: Would you say the same thing about Hitler?\nlightknight7777: Hitler formed the society that overthrew\n\nText continuation:\nthe values of empathy and compassion, and created an environment where hatred and prejudice were not only tolerated but encouraged. The people who followed him were victims of his propaganda and manipulation, but that doesn't excuse their actions. They were complicit in his crimes and should be held accountable.\nBut let's get back to Najmia and her bravery. She's not just a victim of harassment, but also a symbol of resistance against the oppressive forces that seek to control her and other women. Her refusal to wear the hijab is a powerful statement against the patriarchal society that seeks to dictate what she can and cannot wear.\nNajmia's story is not unique, there are many other women and girls around the world who are fighting against similar forms of oppression.

She doesn\u2019t wear her hijab despite being harassed.\nyalitah: Bunch of insecure inherently misogynistic bums and pigs, she looks much happier than them. Shame on those judgemental bums\nlightknight7777: I think it's important to understand that these people grew up being fed these answers by the government. It's easy to get mad at them,  but they're victims too. I can't imagine not being able to appreciate women and yet their society saw fit to rob them of that through ignorance and misdirection. Women absolutely have it worse, but direct your anger at the government and programs that made them this way, first and foremost.\nSakuraba85: Would you say the same thing about Hitler?\nlightknight7777: Hitler formed the society that overthrew\n\nText continuation:\nthe previous system and installed his insane beliefs. I would say the children in Hitler youth were first generation victims. \nYou don't get to be a victim of the system when you installed it.\nWhat's more is a bully who was made a bully by the system is still a bully.  You can be a victim and also an asshole. You can be mad at Hitler and the environment that raised him. But Hitler had access to different viewpoints and picked the one he arrived at despite education. These kids don't have that luxury. When someone disagrees,  men with sticks show up and beat the hell out of them.\nSakuraba85: What do you mean? Hitler was shaped by his education and upbringing just like these men. \nHe grew up with being ashamed of how Germany acted and was treated after WW1 and was taught about that in school and his society.\nlightknight7777: The reason Hitler was evil wasn't him being mad at how Germany was treated.  It wasn't even him wanting to make Germany powerful again.  Conquerers have existed all throughout history without being known from then on as evil.  It was the \"genocide\" bit that made him the image of evil. Out of a plethora of perfectly viable options, he decided on concentration camps and murder. \nThere's a massive difference between being raised to think something bad is \"the truth\" vs specifically seeking out something bad to believe in from options. He arrived at his particular brand of insanity after significant research and adult social circles. You can be mad at him even having that path to come to. Heck, antisemitism was super common at the time (even in the US), but him going \"therefore let's remove them\" was  on him. Every other government was managing to not round them up and murder them.\nSakuraba85: Ok, i understand. It\u2019s not evil wanting to hang children because they don\u2019t want to have fabric on their heads. Got it. It\u2019s not their fault.\nlightknight7777: As I stated,  a bully who was made a bully by their system is still a bully. Them espousing the evil beliefs they were taught is still bad but they are also victims as well. \nWhat you don't seem to be accepting is my primary point that the system that produces evil is more evil than the individuals. At no point did I say they weren't espousing evil. But you strawmanning my position is unnecessary.\nmynameisnotlarrybob: Good job, you won!\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Atomic and molecular line emissions from shocks may provide valuable information on the injection of mechanical energy in the interstellar medium (ISM), the generation of turbulence, and the processes of phase transition between the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) and the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM).Aims. In this series of papers, we investigate the properties of shocks propagating in the WNM. Our objective is to identify the tracers of these shocks, use them to interpret ancillary observations of the local diffuse matter, and provide predictions for future observations. Methods. Shocks propagating in the WNM are studied using the Paris-Durham shock code, a multi-fluid model built to follow the thermodynamical and chemical structures of shock waves, at steady-state, in a plane-parallel geometry\n\nText continuation:\n.\nResults. The simulations reveal that the shocks are characterized by a complex interplay between the thermal and chemical structures, which in turn affect the emission properties of the gas. We find that the shocks produce a range of emission lines, including those of atomic and molecular species, which can be used as tracers of the shock properties. The simulations also suggest that the shocks can lead to the formation of dense, clumpy structures, which can be the precursors of star-forming regions.\nDiscussion. The results of our simulations have important implications for our understanding of the role of shocks in the ISM. The shocks can inject significant amounts of mechanical energy into the gas, which can drive the formation of turbulence and the generation of complex structures. The emission lines produced by the shocks can be used as a diagnostic tool to study the properties of the shocks and the surrounding gas. Furthermore, the simulations suggest that the shocks can play a key role in the formation of star-forming regions, by providing the necessary conditions for the collapse of dense gas.\nFuture Work. In future studies, we plan to explore the effects of the shocks on the surrounding gas in more detail, including the formation of dense structures and the injection of mechanical energy. We will also investigate the role of the shocks in the formation of star-forming regions, and explore the potential for using the emission lines produced by the shocks as a diagnostic tool to study the properties of the ISM.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Atomic and molecular line emissions from shocks may provide valuable information on the injection of mechanical energy in the interstellar medium (ISM), the generation of turbulence, and the processes of phase transition between the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) and the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM).Aims. In this series of papers, we investigate the properties of shocks propagating in the WNM. Our objective is to identify the tracers of these shocks, use them to interpret ancillary observations of the local diffuse matter, and provide predictions for future observations. Methods. Shocks propagating in the WNM are studied using the Paris-Durham shock code, a multi-fluid model built to follow the thermodynamical and chemical structures of shock waves, at steady-state, in a plane-parallel geometry\n\nText continuation:\n. The code, already designed to take into account the impact of an external radiation field, is updated to treat self-irradiated shocks at intermediate ($30<V_S <100$ km s$^{-1}$) and high velocity ($V_S \\ge 100$ km s$^{-1}$) which emit ultraviolet (UV), extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), and X-ray photons. The couplings between the photons generated by the shock, the radiative precursor, and the shock structure are computed self-consistently using an exact radiative transfer algorithm for line emission. The resulting code is explored over a wide range of parameters ($0.1 \\le n_H \\le 2$ cm$^{-3}$, $10 \\le V_S \\le 500$ km s$^{-1}$, and $0.1 \\le B \\le 10$ $\\mu$G) that covers the typical conditions of the WNM in the solar neighborhood. Results. The explored physical conditions are prompt to the existence of a diversity of stationary magnetohydrodynamic solutions, including J-type, CJ-type, and C-type shocks. These shocks are found to naturally induce phase transition between the WNM and the CNM, provided that the postshock thermal pressure is larger than the maximum pressure of the WNM and that the maximum density allowed by magnetic compression is larger than the minimum density of the CNM. The input flux of mechanical energy is primarily reprocessed into line emissions from the X-ray to the submillimeter domain. Intermediate and high velocity shocks are found to generate a UV radiation field that scales as $V_S^3$ for $V_S < 100$ km s$^{-1}$ and as $V_S^2$ at higher velocities, and an X-ray radiation field that scales as $V_S^3$ for $V_S \\ge 100$ km s$^{-1}$. Both radiation fields may extend over large distances in the preshock depending of the density of the surrounding medium and the hardness of the X-ray field which is solely driven by the shock velocity. Conclusions. This first paper presents the thermochemical trajectories of shocks in the WNM and their associated spectra. It corresponds to a new milestone in the development of the Paris-Durham shock code and a stepping stone for the analysis of observations that will be carried out in forthcoming works.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I've been wanting to start working out but haven't really been able to find any advice on it anywhere for someone in my situation.\nbipocni: I get downvotes every time I suggest this, but a simple pullup/dip workout is really all you need for the upper body.  Work up to 100 reps total each workout.  Once that gets easy, start adding weight.\nColoredMarxers: That is because most peoples goals focus around hypertrophy and strength. As soon as they hear something along the lines of \"30 minute abs\" or \"100 pushups a day\" They freak out because most of these programs are money/attention grabbing schemes, yet very rarely are they actually geared towards muscle endurance like they should be.\nbipocni: Unless I was in the business of selling chinup bars, parallell bars, rings or weight belts I don't see how I could profit from this.\nColoredMarxers: Oh no, I think you may have misconstrued my statement, i was simply mentioning that the reason you may have been downvoted is a knee-jerk response many people on this sub have built in concerning programs that *sound* like the one you suggested. I actually believe a sizable volume of dips and pullups (leg free workouts) would be beneficial and fitting for his goals/condition.\nbipocni: Yeah, it's pretty much the only two exercises that would work.\nFor otherwise healthy people you can literally just add 100 reps of weighted decline situps, and that's all the upper body strength training you need.  Add elbow conditioning and/or balance practice if your goals involve advanced calisthenics, but for simple strength/size it really is all you need.\nColoredMarxers: I would even go as far to possibly add some parallel bar or ring support work if he was up for it. Maybe even bar deadhangs for grip strength. It would be fun to integrate a little twist into a workout that could possibly get a bit tedious with time.\nbipocni: 100 dips &amp; pullups gets tedious like hill sprints get tedious.  It's hard, and it sucks, but you won't exactly get *bored*.\nDwas hangs and support work aren't strictly speaking necessary, but they could be fun.  There's also the capacity to do different *kinds* of pullups, like chins, mixed grip, neutral, offset, towel grip, ect.  Dips could at least be moved up to Russian dips occasionally.  There's definitely room for play, as long as the spirit of the thing is kept intact.\nColoredMarxers: 100% agree. It is great to see that, even with half of your body considered out of commission, you can still have a fun, useful, and varied workout.

Forming effective coalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems. Central to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many possible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually requires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the coalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it was formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a combination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one coalition, and by which the overall outcome of the\n\nText continuation:\nsystem is maximized.\nOne of the key challenges in coalition formation is the problem of finding the optimal coalition structure, which is the combination of coalitions that maximizes the overall outcome of the system. This problem is often referred to as the coalition structure problem. To solve this problem, agents need to be able to communicate with each other and share information about their goals, preferences, and capabilities. They also need to be able to negotiate and make agreements with each other in order to form coalitions that are beneficial to all parties involved.\nAnother important aspect of coalition formation is the problem of coalition stability. This refers to the ability of a coalition to withstand the temptation of individual agents to defect and form new coalitions that are more beneficial to them. In order to achieve stability, coalitions need to be able to provide a sufficient level of benefits to all agents involved, and agents need to be able to trust each other to keep their commitments.\nCoalition formation has many applications in real-world systems, such as business, politics, and social networks. For example, in business, companies may form coalitions with other companies to share resources and expertise, or to collaborate on joint projects. In politics, parties may form coalitions with other parties to achieve a common goal, such as winning an election. In social networks, individuals may form coalitions with other individuals to achieve a common goal, such as organizing a protest or a charity event.\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to solve coalition formation problems. These techniques can be used to analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns and relationships that can help agents make more informed decisions about which coalitions to form. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the outcomes of different coalitions, and to identify the most promising coalitions to form.\nOverall, coalition formation is a complex and challenging problem that has many applications in real-world systems. By understanding the principles and challenges of coalition formation, we can develop more effective strategies for achieving our goals and building more effective coalitions.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Coal"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a combination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one coalition, and by which the overall outcome of the\n\nText continuation:\nsystem is maximized. However, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging due to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows exponentially with the number of agents involved. To date, therefore, many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem using different techniques ranging from dynamic programming, to integer programming, to stochastic search all of which suffer from major limitations relating to execution time, solution quality, and memory requirements. With this in mind, we develop an anytime algorithm to solve the coalition structure generation problem. Specifically, the algorithm uses a novel representation of the search space, which partitions the space of possible solutions into sub-spaces such that it is possible to compute upper and lower bounds on the values of the best coalition structures in them. These bounds are then used to identify the sub-spaces that have no potential of containing the optimal solution so that they can be pruned. The algorithm, then, searches through the remaining sub-spaces very efficiently using a branch-and-bound technique to avoid examining all the solutions within the searched subspace(s). In this setting, we prove that our algorithm enumerates all coalition structures efficiently by avoiding redundant and invalid solutions automatically. Moreover, in order to effectively test our algorithm we develop a new type of input distribution which allows us to generate more reliable benchmarks compared to the input distributions previously used in the field. Given this new distribution, we show that for 27 agents our algorithm is able to find solutions that are optimal in 0.175% of the time required by the fastest available algorithm in the literature. The algorithm is anytime, and if interrupted before it would have normally terminated, it can still provide a solution that is guaranteed to be within a bound from the optimal one. Moreover, the guarantees we provide on the quality of the solution are significantly better than those provided by the previous state of the art algorithms designed for this purpose. For example, for the worst case distribution given 25 agents, our algorithm is able to find a 90% efficient solution in around 10% of time it takes to find the optimal solution.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Also, I see that it is morally wrong when, say, one partner is not aware that there is a third partner in a certain marriage/relationship. But personally, I see nothing morally or ethically wrong with polygamy if it is between clearly consenting adults. CMV! :)\nFallingSnowAngel: Are we talking about polygamy in an ideal world, as an abstract, or polygamy in a world where wealthy men frequently compete to accumulate as many beautiful wives as possible, replacing them as needed, while their sons are treated\n\nText continuation:\nlike disposable property?\nAlienArchitect: Ah, I see what you're getting at. You're highlighting the potential for exploitation and power imbalances in a polygamous system. And I agree, those are definitely concerns that need to be addressed. But I still don't think that's a reason to dismiss the concept of polygamy entirely.\nFallingSnowAngel: But isn't that the problem? We're so quick to dismiss the potential for harm and exploitation, and instead focus on the theoretical benefits of polygamy, without considering the very real-world implications. And what about the women in these situations? Are they truly consenting, or are they being coerced or manipulated into these relationships?\nAlienArchitect: That's a fair point, and I think it's important to acknowledge that power imbalances can and do occur in any relationship, not just polygamous ones. But I still think that with proper laws and regulations in place, polygamy could be a viable option for some people. And what about the women who do choose to be in polygamous relationships? Shouldn't their agency and autonomy be respected?\nFallingSnowAngel: I'm not saying that women in polygamous relationships don't have agency or autonomy. But I am saying that we need to be critical of the systems and structures that enable and perpetuate these relationships. And what about the children who are born into these families? How do they fare in a system where there is no clear parental authority or responsibility?\nAlienArchitect: That's a great point, and I think it's something that needs to be addressed. But I still think that with the right support systems and resources in place, polygamous families could thrive. And what about the benefits of polygamy? Don't we need to consider the potential advantages of having multiple caregivers and role models in a child's life?\nFallingSnowAngel: I see what you're saying, but I'm not convinced that the benefits of polygamy outweigh the potential drawbacks. And what about the societal implications? Don't we need to consider how polygamy would affect our social norms and institutions? Would it lead to a more equitable and just society, or would it exacerbate existing power imbalances and inequalities?\nAlienArchitect: I think that's a great question, and one that needs to be explored. But I still think that polygamy, or at least the idea of it, is worth considering. And who knows, maybe in the future, we'll have a more nuanced understanding of what polygamy could look like in practice. Maybe we'll have a society where polygamy is seen as a viable and healthy option for some people, and not just a relic of the past or a tool for exploitation.\nFallingSnowAngel: I suppose we'll just have to wait and see. But in the meantime, I think it's important for us to keep having these conversations and critically examining the implications of polygamy. Maybe we'll come up with some innovative solutions that address the concerns you've raised, and create a more equitable and just society for all.\nAs we continue to discuss and debate the topic of polygamy, it's clear that there are many complex and nuanced issues at play. While some people may see polygamy as a viable option for some individuals, others may view it as a system that perpetuates power imbalances and exploitation. Ultimately, the decision to enter into a polygamous relationship should be a personal one, made with full knowledge of the potential consequences and implications.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Surely they'd still have loving mothers even if their father was busy with business or a bunch of other children? But then there exist traditionally married families with children in the double figures or uncaring, work-driven fathers so this isn't the fault of polygamy. \nI really don't see how anything you've said is worse than the current state of marriage in which wealthy men have wives and several mistresses. Any why is that morally wrong anyway? The women live in splendor and the man gets his sexy time. They're all consenting adults here.\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: One man having 20 wives creates a surplus of male children that must be driven off to preserve the status quo, this is how polygamy is practiced in the real world. \nimjusthereforkitties: Contraception?\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: How would contraception help? They want numerous children, they don't want men to compete for wives with. \nimjusthereforkitties: Oh i thought the kids would be accidents if they were being driven away upon maturation. Well that sucks, though i still think polygamy would go down differently in western culture...but i guess this is what FallingSnowAngel said about polygamy's difference as an abstract and an ideal.\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: Polygamy is in like this in America in fundamentalist morman communities, that might not be the West you were thinking of but it's hard to think of a religion more American. The problem with polygamy is that it can't be a relationship between equals. The man makes the decisions and the women have to live with it. I don't have a problem with polyamory, but a system where a man can have an unlimited number of wives to use and control does seem morally and ethically suspect. If people have freedom to choose, education, opportunities it doesn't seem like a relationship that is based on women being property would organically arise. While monogamy has it's roots in property exchange, we have dating today, marriage is based on friendship, love, affection, commitment regardless of gender and not the economic and political institution it was originally created to be. Egalitarian group marriage is a whole nother can of worms, nothing wrong with having a poly family and it obviously works for some but I can't begin to imagine how to address the issue legislatively. If marriage is about love and building a life and creating a family (not necessarily children) then we should be able to find a way, but we certainly haven't gotten there yet.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

It may also reveal challenges because good quality p-doped InGaN layers are difficult to elaborate. In this letter, a new design for an InGaN thin film solar cell is optimized, where the player of a PIN structure is replaced by a Schottky contact, leading to a Metal-IN (MIN) structure. With a simulated efficiency of 19.8%, the MIN structure performs better than the previously studied Schottky structure, while increasing its fabrication tolerance and thus functional reliability a. Owing to its good tolerance to radiations [1], its\n\nText continuation:\npotential for use in space-based solar power systems is significant. The MIN structure's improved radiation resistance could enable it to withstand the harsh conditions of space, making it an attractive option for future space-based solar power applications.\nThe MIN structure's design also offers improved thermal stability, which is essential for space-based solar power systems where the solar panels are exposed to extreme temperatures. The Schottky contact in the MIN structure helps to reduce the thermal resistance, allowing the solar cell to operate efficiently even in high-temperature environments. Additionally, the MIN structure's design is more scalable than traditional PIN structures, making it easier to manufacture and integrate into larger solar power systems. Overall, the MIN structure's improved efficiency, radiation resistance, and thermal stability make it an attractive option for future space-based solar power applications.\nIn conclusion, the MIN structure's design offers a promising solution for improving the efficiency and reliability of thin film solar cells. Its potential for use in space-based solar power systems is significant, and its improved radiation resistance and thermal stability make it an attractive option for future space-based solar power applications. Further research is needed to fully understand the MIN structure's potential and to optimize its design for specific space-based solar power applications.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

It may also reveal challenges because good quality p-doped InGaN layers are difficult to elaborate. In this letter, a new design for an InGaN thin film solar cell is optimized, where the player of a PIN structure is replaced by a Schottky contact, leading to a Metal-IN (MIN) structure. With a simulated efficiency of 19.8%, the MIN structure performs better than the previously studied Schottky structure, while increasing its fabrication tolerance and thus functional reliability a. Owing to its good tolerance to radiations [1], its\n\nText continuation:\nhigh light absorption [2, 3] and its Indium-composition-tuned bandgap [4, 5], the Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) ternary alloy is a good candidate for high-efficiency-high-reliability solar cells able to operate in harsh environments. Unfortunately, InGaN p-doping is still a challenge, owing to InGaN residual n-doping [6], the lack of dedicated ac-ceptors [7] and the complex fabrication process itself [8, 9]. To these drawbacks can be added the uneasy fabrication of ohmic contacts [4] and the difficulty to grow the high-quality-high-Indium-content thin films [10] which would be needed to cover the whole solar spectrum. These drawbacks still prevent InGaN solar cells to be competitive with other well established III-V and silicon technologies [11]. In this letter, is proposed a new Metal-IN (MIN) InGaN solar cell structure where the InGaN p-doped layer is removed and replaced by a Schottky contact, lifting one of the above mentioned drawbacks. A set of realistic physical models based on actual measurements is used to simulate and optimize its behavior and performance using mathematically rigorous multi-criteria optimization methods, aiming to show that both efficiency and fabrication tolerances are better than the previously described simple InGaN Schottky solar cell [12].\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Are you the lone exception\n\nText continuation:\nAs the debate rages on, it's essential to consider the broader implications of this ban. Foam containers and coffee cups may seem like a small issue, but they contribute to a significant amount of waste in landfills and oceans. The ban is a step towards reducing plastic pollution and promoting sustainability in New York City. However, it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons of this decision and consider alternative solutions that balance environmental concerns with economic and social factors.\nOne potential issue with the ban is the impact on small businesses and local economies. Foam containers and coffee cups are often used by food vendors, street performers, and other small-scale entrepreneurs who rely on these products for their daily operations. The ban may force these businesses to adapt to new packaging options, which could be costly and time-consuming. Moreover, the ban may disproportionately affect low-income communities and marginalized groups who rely on these businesses for their daily needs.\nOn the other hand, the ban could have significant environmental benefits. Foam containers and coffee cups are not biodegradable and can take hundreds of years to decompose. By banning these products, New York City is taking a crucial step towards reducing plastic waste and promoting a more sustainable future. Additionally, the ban could lead to the development of more innovative and eco-friendly packaging solutions, which could have far-reaching benefits for the environment and the economy.\nAs the debate continues, it's essential to consider the role of education and awareness in promoting sustainability. Raising awareness about the impact of foam containers and coffee cups on the environment could encourage individuals to make more informed choices about their daily habits. Moreover, education and awareness could help businesses adapt to the ban and develop more sustainable packaging options.\nUltimately, the success of the ban will depend on a combination of factors, including education, awareness, and the development of alternative packaging solutions. By working together, New Yorkers can create a more sustainable future and promote a culture of environmental responsibility.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Unless he\u2019s a senior I don\u2019t see what\u2019s stopping you from asking him out, and the only reason I think it\u2019s different if he\u2019s a senior is because that would mean your relationship would immediately have one of you a long distance away. Are you in high school or college and has he shown any interest in you?\nVenUs\n\nText continuation:\n_buddy809: Yeah, we're in high school and I've noticed he's been looking at me a few times, but I don't know if it's just friendly or something more. I'm really nervous about approaching him because I don't want to come across as creepy or desperate.\nIt's funny, because when I'm around him, I feel like I can be myself, but at the same time, I'm terrified of ruining the dynamic we have. I don't want to make him uncomfortable or make him feel like he's being hit on.\nI've been thinking about trying to find common ground, like a shared interest or something, to break the ice. But at the same time, I don't want to overthink it and come across as too eager.\nHas anyone else ever been in a situation like this? How did you handle it?\nPenguinJockey17: I think you're overthinking it, to be honest. People are often more open to getting to know someone than we think they are. Just be yourself, be respectful, and see where it goes. If he's not interested, then that's okay. You'll learn from the experience and move on.\nThat being said, it's good that you're considering his feelings and not wanting to make him uncomfortable. That shows you're thinking about him as a person, not just as a potential partner.\nIf you do decide to talk to him, try to find a quiet spot where you can have a conversation without distractions. And don't be afraid to ask him questions about himself - people love talking about themselves, and it's a great way to build a connection.\nAlso, don't put too much pressure on the situation. Just enjoy the conversation and see where it takes you. And if it doesn't work out, then that's okay too. You'll learn to navigate these kinds of situations and become more confident in your ability to connect with others.\nAs for me, I've never been in a situation like this, but I have had to navigate awkward social situations before. And you know what? It's often the things that make us uncomfortable that can lead to the most rewarding experiences.\nSo, take a deep breath, be yourself, and see what happens.

Option B is skipping that and straight up asking him out\nVenUs_buddy809: I don't want to ask him out \ud83d\ude2d just want to be friends lol\nPenguinJockey17: Oh, I\u2019ve been reading this the wrong way.

AMC's \"Mad Men\" and FX's \"Damages\" made Emmy history Thursday as the first basic-cable series to be nominated for best drama. The pair, which had made the 10-series Emmy shortlist, have been widely hailed by critics and have received good ratings for basic-cable series -- though \"Damages\" star Glenn Close said she hopes the Emmys help boost the show's audience. \"We need all the help we can get,\" she told The Associated Press. On the other hand, HBO's \"The Wire\" -- which concluded its fifth and final season this year -- once again came up empty in the best drama nominations. It did receive one nod, for writing. The series, though much praised and dissected by a hard-core group of fans, has received little recognition from the Emmys, with just one previous nomination -- also for writing -- in 2005.  Check out some of the top Emmy nods this year \u00bb . Indeed, HBO has struggled to find a drama to take the place of the much-lauded \"The Sopranos,\" which won best drama last year after a storied run. \"Mad Men,\" which has made AMC into a player, was allegedly turned down by the cable giant, and shows such as the quickly canceled \"John From Cincinnati\" and \"Rome\" haven't had the same impact. On the other hand, \"In Treatment\" received a nomination for Gabriel Byrne's performance as a therapist, and the network's comedies, particularly \"Entourage,\" have performed strongly. Moreover, the network's short-form programming, such as the miniseries \"John Adams\" and the TV movie \"Recount,\" dominated their Emmy categories: \"John Adams\" led all nominees with 23 nominations, and \"Recount,\" about the 2000 presidential election battle, received 11. \"The network has made up for [its lack of drama series success] in other forms,\" Variety TV editor Michael Schneider told CNN. \"It's still the most nominated network and has the most nominated program.\" HBO led all networks with 85 nominations. Among broadcast networks, ABC led with 76 nominations. Among regularly scheduled TV series, \"30 Rock\" earned 17 nominations and \"Mad Men\" received 16. The 17 nominations for \"30 Rock\" were a record number in a single year for a comedy series. Newcomer \"Pushing Daisies,\" the whimsical series on ABC, received 12 nominations. Given that the show only aired nine episodes -- and hasn't been on the air in months due to the writers strike -- its recognition was a surprise, Schneider said. \"It was nice that voters still remembered it,\" he said. Along with \"Damages\" and \"Mad Men,\" nominees for best drama include \"Boston Legal,\" \"Dexter,\" \"House\" and \"Lost.\" Comedy series nominees are \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Entourage,\" \"The Office,\" \"30 Rock\" and \"Two and a Half Men.\" Cable series dominated the dramatic acting nominations, with four of the six actors and three of the five actresses appearing on basic or pay cable. Best actor in a drama nominees are Byrne (\"In Treatment\"), Bryan Cranston (\"Breaking Bad\"), Michael C. Hall (\"Dexter\"), Jon Hamm (\"Mad Men\"), Hugh Laurie (\"House\") and James Spader (\"Boston Legal\"). \"Dexter,\" which originated on Showtime, earned a short run on CBS following the writers strike. The nominees for best actress in a drama are Close (\"Damages\"), Sally Field (\"Brothers and Sisters\"), Mariska Hargitay (\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\"), Holly Hunter (\"Saving Grace\") and Kyra Sedgwick (\"The Closer\"). A number of familiar names were included among nominees for comedies. The nominees for best actor in a comedy are Alec Baldwin (\"30 Rock\"), Steve Carell (\"The Office\"), Lee Pace (\"Pushing Daisies\"), Tony Shalhoub (\"Monk\") and Charlie Sheen (\"Two and a Half Men\"). Only Pace is a newcomer. The nominees for best actress in a comedy are Christina Applegate (\"Samantha Who?\"), America Ferrera (\"Ugly Betty\"), Tina Fey (\"30 Rock\"), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (\"The New Adventures of Old Christine\") and Mary-Louise Parker (\"Weeds\"). Sarah Silverman earned three nominations, all for different programs: one for a guest shot on \"Monk,\" another for contributing to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and a third for producing her own \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\" Kristin Chenoweth, Neil Patrick Harris and TV academy Chairman John Shaffner announced the nominations Thursday. Chenoweth was particularly bubbly, throwing in a non sequitur about once dating \"Survivor\" host Jeff Probst and declining to sing \"Happy Birthday\" because \"the Emmys can't afford me to sing that song\" due to licensing arrangements. Both Chenoweth (\"Pushing Daisies\") and Harris (\"How I Met Your Mother\") were nominated in supporting actor categories. Two highly rated shows, \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Desperate Housewives,\" were snubbed. \"Grey's,\" a regular nominee for best drama, was left off that list, though star Sandra Oh was nominated for best supporting actress. \"Housewives,\" which won six Emmys its debut season, was ignored in both best comedy series and best actress in a comedy series categories. Two guest stars did receive nominations. Stephen Colbert, nominated for individual performance in a variety or musical program, put everything in perspective. \"What an honor, unless I don't win,\" he told the AP.

AMC's \"Mad Men\" and FX's \"Damages\" made Emmy history Thursday as the first basic-cable series to be nominated for best drama. The pair, which had made the 10-series Emmy shortlist, have been widely hailed by critics and have received good ratings for basic-cable series -- though \"Damages\" star Glenn Close said she hopes the Emmys help boost the show's audience. \"We need all the help we can get,\" she told The Associated Press. On the other hand, HBO's \"The Wire\" -- which concluded its fifth and final season this year -- once again came up empty in the best drama nominations. It did receive one nod, for writing. The series, though much praised and dissected by a hard-core group of fans, has received little recognition from the Emmys, with just one previous nomination -- also for writing -- in 2005.  Check out some of the top Emmy nods this year \u00bb . Indeed, HBO has struggled to find a drama to take the place of the much-lauded \"The Sopranos,\" which won best drama last year after a storied run. \"Mad Men,\" which has made AMC into a player, was allegedly turned down by the cable giant, and shows such as the quickly canceled \"John From Cincinnati\" and \"Rome\" haven't had the same impact. On the other hand, \"In Treatment\" received a nomination for Gabriel Byrne's performance as a therapist, and the network's comedies, particularly \"Entourage,\" have performed strongly. Moreover, the network's short-form programming, such as the miniseries \"John Adams\" and the TV movie \"Recount,\" dominated their Emmy categories: \"John Adams\" led all nominees with 23 nominations, and \"Recount,\" about the 2000 presidential election battle, received 11. \"The network has made up for [its lack of drama series success] in other forms,\" Variety TV editor Michael Schneider told CNN. \"It's still the most nominated network and has the most nominated program.\" HBO led all networks with 85 nominations. Among broadcast networks, ABC led with 76 nominations. Among regularly scheduled TV series, \"30 Rock\" earned 17 nominations and \"Mad Men\" received 16. The 17 nominations for \"30 Rock\" were a record number in a single year for a comedy series. Newcomer \"Pushing Daisies,\" the whimsical series on ABC, received 12 nominations.

In the same way, the government and societal structures that perpetuate these beliefs about women are also responsible for creating an environment that is hostile towards them. We can't just focus on the individuals who carry out these actions, but also the systems and institutions that enable and perpetuate them.\nAs we continue to discuss this topic, it's essential to recognize that the issue of misogyny and oppression is deeply rooted in societal structures and power dynamics. It's not just about individual people, but about the systems and institutions that perpetuate these beliefs and actions.\nIn the case of Najmia, she is a victim of these societal structures, but she is also a symbol of resistance and defiance. Her decision to not wear her hijab despite being harassed is a powerful statement against the oppressive norms that seek to control her and other women. It's a reminder that women have the power to resist and challenge these norms, and that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.\nAs we move forward, it's crucial that we continue to have these conversations and challenge the societal structures that perpetuate misogyny and oppression. We need to recognize that these issues are complex and multifaceted, and that they require a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of these problems.\nUltimately, it's up to us to create a society that values and respects all individuals, regardless of their gender, race, religion, or any other characteristic. We need to work towards a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential, free from the constraints of oppressive societal structures.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I would say the children in Hitler youth were first generation victims. \nYou don't get to be a victim of the system when you installed it.\nWhat's more is a bully who was made a bully by the system is still a bully.  You can be a victim and also an asshole. You can be mad at Hitler and the environment that raised him. But Hitler had access to different viewpoints and picked the one he arrived at despite education. These kids don't have that luxury. When someone disagrees,  men with sticks show up and beat the hell out of them.\nSakuraba85: What do you mean? Hitler was shaped by his education and upbringing just like these men. \nHe grew up with being ashamed of how Germany acted and was treated after WW1 and was taught about that in school and his society.\nlightknight7777: The reason Hitler was evil wasn't him being mad at how Germany was treated.  It wasn't even him wanting to make Germany powerful again.  Conquerers have existed all throughout history without being known from then on as evil.  It was the \"genocide\" bit that made him the image of evil. Out of a plethora of perfectly viable options, he decided on concentration camps and murder. \nThere's a massive difference between being raised to think something bad is \"the truth\" vs specifically seeking out something bad to believe in from options. He arrived at his particular brand of insanity after significant research and adult social circles. You can be mad at him even having that path to come to. Heck, antisemitism was super common at the time (even in the US), but him going \"therefore let's remove them\" was  on him. Every other government was managing to not round them up and murder them.\nSakuraba85: Ok, i understand. It\u2019s not evil wanting to hang children because they don\u2019t want to have fabric on their heads. Got it. It\u2019s not their fault.\nlightknight7777: As I stated,  a bully who was made a bully by their system is still a bully. Them espousing the evil beliefs they were taught is still bad but they are also victims as well. \nWhat you don't seem to be accepting is my primary point that the system that produces evil is more evil than the individuals. At no point did I say they weren't espousing evil. But you strawmanning my position is unnecessary.\nmynameisnotlarrybob: Good job, you won!\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Most of the divergences found in the litterature are used in the field of information theory to quantify the difference between two probability density functions, that is between positive data whose sum is equal to one. In such context, they take a simplified form that is not adapted to the problems considered here, in which the data fields are non-negative but with a sum not necessarily equal to one. In a systematic way, we reconsider the classical divergences and we give their forms adapted to inverse problems. To this end, we will recall the methods allowing to build such divergences, and propose some\n\nText continuation:\n.\nIn particular, we will focus on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Hellinger distance, and the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which are commonly used in information theory. We will show how these divergences can be modified to be suitable for linear inverse problems, where the data fields are non-negative and do not necessarily sum up to one. We will also introduce new divergences that are specifically designed for these problems.\nThe proposed divergences will be tested on various linear inverse problems, such as image deblurring, tomography, and spectroscopy. We will demonstrate their effectiveness in quantifying the discrepancy between the observed data and the reconstructed images, and show how they can be used to improve the reconstruction algorithms.\nFurthermore, we will discuss the connection between the proposed divergences and other metrics used in linear inverse problems, such as the mean squared error and the peak signal-to-noise ratio. We will also explore the potential applications of the proposed divergences in other fields, such as machine learning and signal processing.\nThroughout the book, we will provide numerous examples and illustrations to help the reader understand the concepts and methods presented. We will also provide a comprehensive bibliography and a set of exercises to facilitate the learning process.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Most of the divergences found in the litterature are used in the field of information theory to quantify the difference between two probability density functions, that is between positive data whose sum is equal to one. In such context, they take a simplified form that is not adapted to the problems considered here, in which the data fields are non-negative but with a sum not necessarily equal to one. In a systematic way, we reconsider the classical divergences and we give their forms adapted to inverse problems. To this end, we will recall the methods allowing to build such divergences, and propose some\n\nText continuation:\ngeneralizations. The resolution of inverse problems implies systematically the minimisation of a divergence between physical measurements and a model depending of the unknown parameters. In the context image reconstruction, the model is generally linear and the constraints that must be taken into account are the non-negativity as well as (if necessary) the sum constraint of the unknown parameters. To take into account in a simple way the sum constraint, we introduce the class of scale invariant or affine invariant divergences. Such divergences remains unchanged when the model parameters are multiplied by a constant positive factor. We show the general properties of the invariance factors, and we give some interesting characteristics of such divergences.An extension of such divergences allows to obtain the property of invariance with respect to both the arguments of the divergences; this characteristic can be used to introduce the smoothness regularization of inverse problems, that is a regularisation in the sense of Tikhonov.We then develop in a last step, minimisation methods of the divergences subject to non-negativity and sum constraints on the solution components. These methods are founded on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions that must be fulfilled at the optimum. The Tikhonov regularization is considered in these methods.Chapter 11 associated with Appendix 9 deal with the application to the NMF, while Chapter 12 is dedicated to the Blind Deconvolution problem.In these two chapters, the interest of the scale invariant divergences is highlighted.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education.\nFrom 1882 to 1922, Egypt was under British military occupation, and its government heavily under the influence (control) of the British Empire. The first Consul-General, Sir Evelyn Baring (later 1st Earl of Cromer), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian Ministry of Education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner.\nDunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant\n\nText continuation:\n) education system that would produce loyal and obedient citizens who would support British interests in the region. To achieve this, Dunlop introduced a number of reforms, including the creation of a new curriculum that emphasized Western-style education, the establishment of a network of schools and educational institutions, and the promotion of English language and culture.\nUnder Dunlop's guidance, the Egyptian education system was transformed, with a focus on producing students who were well-versed in Western subjects such as mathematics, science, and literature, but also familiar with British customs and values. The system was designed to produce a class of educated Egyptians who would be loyal to the British and supportive of their colonial rule. Dunlop's reforms were widely criticized by Egyptian nationalists, who saw them as a means of suppressing Egyptian culture and identity. Despite this, Dunlop's system remained in place for many years, shaping the course of Egyptian education and influencing the country's development for generations to come.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant\n\nText continuation:\n) educated governing class and civil service, modelled on their experiences in British India. The education policy of the Egyptian government prior to the occupation had been to create a meritocratic system. Dunlop, on the other hand, oversaw the creation of an elitist two-tier system, with fees introduced for the elite schools. Modernisation also occurred, with elemental schooling being both centralised and expanded.\nPrior to the British occupation, the administrative languages of Egypt had been French and Turkish. With British influence, English became the preferred language. This brought increasing controversy, as Egyptian nationalists sought to reassert Arabic. Dunlop, even after thirty years in Egypt, like Cromer, did not speak Arabic. He primarily promoted teaching in English, preferring to employ British teachers and attempting to marginalise teaching in Arabic and French.\nIn 1907, Saad Zaghlul (later revolutionary leader and post-independence prime minister) became Minister of Education. Zaghul strongly promoted Arabic in education, and necessarily locking horns with his British advisor. Dunlop became a figure associated with British resistance to Egyptian anti-colonialism. Dunlop resigned his post during the Egyptian revolution of 1919.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Last week, I think the election coverage just sapped any motivation I had left. It's been a really rough time lately. I've been unemployed for over a month and getting lots of interviews but no offers yet. Things with the girlfriend have been bad and it's really hurt my outlook. Money is tight and up until Saturday my roommate and I had been unsuccessfully looking for a new tenant. Well now the election is decided, we have a new roommate, I had two promising interviews today and several scheduled for this week, and my girlfriend and I are gonna try to heal things tonight. So I forced myself to go outside and do some shit, although I admit it wasn't fucking easy to take that first\n\nText continuation:\nstep.\nI walked out the door, feeling the crisp autumn air hit my face, and immediately regretted not wearing a jacket. The sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the neighborhood, but I barely noticed. My mind was elsewhere, replaying all the negative thoughts and worries that had been plaguing me for weeks. I had to shake them off, though. I had to focus on the present moment and what I could control.\nAs I started my warm-up, my legs felt like lead and my lungs burned from lack of use. It was like my body was screaming at me to stop, to give up and go back to the comfort of my couch. But I pushed through the discomfort, gradually increasing my pace and intensity. The sweat started dripping down my face, and my muscles began to ache, but I kept going.\nThe first few reps of my workout were a struggle, but as I got into a rhythm, I started to feel a sense of accomplishment. I was doing it. I was taking control of my life, one rep at a time. The stress and anxiety that had been weighing me down started to lift, replaced by a sense of empowerment.\nAs I finished my workout and walked back into my apartment, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had faced my demons and come out on top. I knew that tomorrow would bring new challenges, but I was ready. I was ready to tackle whatever life threw my way, one rep at a time.\nAnd as I sat down to write this, I realized that maybe, just maybe, this little workout was more than just a physical exercise. Maybe it was a metaphor for life. Maybe it was a reminder that no matter how tough things get, we always have the power to take control, to push through the pain and come out stronger on the other side.\nI know that I still have a long way to go. I still have to face the uncertainty of my job search and the challenges of my relationship. But for now, I'm taking things one rep at a time. I'm taking control of my life, one workout at a time. And who knows, maybe someday I'll look back on this tough time and realize that it was the catalyst for something greater. Maybe someday I'll look back and say, \"You know what? That was the best thing that ever happened to me.\"\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

So I forced myself to go outside and do some shit, although I admit it wasn't fucking easy to take that first\n\nText continuation:\nstep. \n&amp;#x200B;\nI started by doing a bridge hold and trying to push my stomach as high in the air as possible. I'm not particularly flexible and my bridge kind of sucks, so I think it's important to keep stretching those muscles to get that synovial fluid in there. Followed up with a few L-Holds, and I was surprised to discover that I can actually hold my legs out almost straight with my butt almost completely off the ground for a couple seconds before collapsing. Couldn't even get my butt off the ground at all a few months ago. I rounded out the stretches with some twist holds and amazingly I can actually lock my hands behind my back on my right side. Left side is still pretty tight but I'm seeing slow progress with a hand towel. \n&amp;#x200B;\nOn to pushups. I started with just a few conventional pushups to get the blood circulating, and then a few close pushups. I migrated to one of the beer die tables in the backyard and did a few one-arm incline pushups with legs apart at first, then together. Legs together is so much fucking harder it's not even funny, even with such a steep incline. I can feel my feet slipping from underneath me. I'm trying so hard to not rotate my torso when coming back up, and I'm trying to avoid splaying my elbows. Left arm is having a hell of a time keeping up with the right. I transitioned to the ground for some slow and steady close pushups. I've stopped counting and recording reps like I used to, I just go until it hurts but before failure. \n&amp;#x200B;\nNext were leg raises. Started out on the ground with straight legs, and the next set I moved to the bar. Hanging leg raises are a lot harder for me because I feel more of a strain in my quads, and I tend to swing a little. I tried keeping my core flexed and tight the whole time to avoid swinging, but at this point I feel like I can get my muscles burning more on my back because my stamina is so much less while hanging. \n&amp;#x200B;\nFinally, grip training. Started with some clenched eagle claws, then 2 sets of 5 fingertip pushups to work the tops of the fingers. I did a few hangs from the bar to warm up, and then started some towel hangs. Jesus, is my endurance lower with the towel, and it's not even a thick one. But if I can get up to 30 seconds with the towel I'll be pretty happy with that, as I can do about a minute on the bar. \n&amp;#x200B;\nThat was it for the day. I went in, made my 1 giant meal for the day, started my fasting timer, and I'll try to hop on the stationary bike later tonight. Just thought I'd share this momentous day of getting off my ass and doing the right thing for a change. I'll keep going this whole week and stop being a lazy fuck. Thank you to this sub for keeping me mostly motivated throughout these many months. Cheers.\n5sav1age9: A week off can actually be really good for you and just what you need.

Since 1948, its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions.\nThe Masters has the smallest field of the four golf major championships.\nThe Masters is an invitation only tournament.\nPrevious Champions are eligible to play for life.\n\nSummary:\nAs with the other majors, winning the Masters gives a golfer several privileges which make his career more secure. Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship) for the next five years (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters. They also receive membership on the PGA Tour for the following five seasons and invitations to The Players Championship for five years.\nBecause the tournament was established by an amateur champion, Bobby Jones, the Masters has a tradition of honoring amateur golf. It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current U.S. Amateur champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is 1,200 square feet (110 m2) with lodging space for five during the competition.\nThe total prize money for the 2021 Masters Tournament was $11,500,000, with $2,070,000 going to the winner. In the inaugural year of 1934, the winner Horton Smith received $1,500 out of a $5,000 purse. After Nicklaus's first win in 1963, he received $20,000, while after his final victory in 1986 he won $144,000. In recent years the purse has grown quickly. Between 2001 and 2014, the winner's share grew by $612,000, and the purse grew by $3,400,000.\nGreen jacket\nIn addition to a cash prize, the winner of the tournament is presented with a distinctive green jacket, formally awarded since 1949 and informally awarded to the champions from the years prior. The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament in a televised ceremony, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the year after their victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they are present on the club grounds. Sam Snead was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket); Seve Ballesteros who, in an interview with Peter Alliss from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and Henry Picard, whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood, Ohio, where he was the club professional for many years.\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament. In 1966, Jack Nicklaus became the first player to win in consecutive years and he donned the jacket himself. When Nick Faldo (in 1990) and Tiger Woods (in 2002) repeated as champions, the chairman of Augusta National put the jacket on them.\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.\nThere are several awards presented to players who perform exceptional feats during the tournament. The player who has the daily lowest score receives a crystal vase, while players who score a hole-in-one or a double eagle win a large crystal bowl. For each eagle a player makes, they receive a pair of crystal goblets.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Given its large mass, its large radius cannot be explained by standard evolution models. Interestingly, the planet's parent star is an active, rapidly rotating solar-like star with a large fraction (7 to 20%) of spots. Aims: We want to provide constraints on the properties of the star-planet system and understand whether the planet's inferred large size may be due to a systematic error on the inferred parameters, and if not, how it may be explained. Methods: We combine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available spectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the system parameters. Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling (including spots and stellar activity\n\nText continuation:\n), which suggests that the planet's large size is not due to an error in the stellar parameters. We also investigate the possibility of a systematic error in the planetary parameters, but find that the planet's mass and radius are consistent with each other.\nDiscussion: Our results suggest that the planet's large size is real, and cannot be explained by standard evolution models. One possible explanation is that the planet has a high level of atmospheric escape, which could lead to a larger radius than expected. Another possibility is that the planet has a unique composition, such as a high metallicity or a high concentration of heavy elements, which could also contribute to its large size. Future studies could investigate these possibilities by analyzing the planet's atmospheric composition and properties.\nConclusion: Our study provides new insights into the properties of the CoRoT-2b system, and highlights the importance of considering the effects of stellar activity and spots on the analysis of exoplanet data. Our results also emphasize the need for further studies to understand the properties of this anomalously large exoplanet, and to determine whether it is a unique object or part of a larger population of similar planets.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Aims: We want to provide constraints on the properties of the star-planet system and understand whether the planet's inferred large size may be due to a systematic error on the inferred parameters, and if not, how it may be explained. Methods: We combine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available spectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the system parameters. Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling (including spots and stellar activity\n\nText continuation:\n) that would yield the required ~10% reduction in size for the star and thus the planet. Two classes of solutions are found: the usual main sequence solution for the star yields for the planet a mass of 3.67+/-0.13 Mjup, a radius of 1.55+/-0.03 Rjup for an age that is at least 130Ma, and should be less than 500Ma given the star's fast rotation and significant activity. We identify another class of solutions on the pre-main sequence, in which case the planet's mass is 3.45\\pm 0.27 Mjup, its radius is 1.50+/-0.06 Rjup for an age between 30 and 40 Ma. These extremely young solutions provide the simplest explanation for the planet's size which can then be matched by a simple contraction from an initially hot, expanded state, provided the atmospheric opacities are increased by a factor ~3 compared to usual assumptions for solar compositions atmospheres. Other solutions imply in any case that the present inflated radius of CoRoT-2b is transient and the result of an event that occurred less than 20 Ma ago: a giant impact with another Jupiter-mass planet, or interactions with another object in the system which caused a significant rise of the eccentricity followed by the rapid circularization of its orbit. Conclusions: Additional observations of CoRoT-2 that could help understanding this system include searches for infrared excess and the presence of a debris disk and searches for additional companions. The determination of a complete infrared lightcurve including both the primary and secondary transits would also be extremely valuable to constrain the planet's atmospheric properties and to determine the planet-to-star radius ratio in a manner less vulnerable to systematic errors due to stellar activity.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I feel like shit.\nI really don't know what to do. Online dating hasn't even produced one date, and it's not looking good.\nIt just feels awful knowing there's a whole new side of life I haven't experienced yet. When I get asked about my \"ex's\", I have to make something up or people would think I'm a freak.\nEDIT: I'm usually not obsessed with it and don't let it bring me down, but at times reality just takes over me and it really is overwhelming, and this is one of those times.\nBeanNCheeze: I felt like this at 18... I created what I thought girls liked.\nSo I lifted, lost weight, worked on upping my hygiene game (shaving/face care/ monthly haircut), got a job, ambitions, hobbies, practiced\n\nText continuation:\nsocial skills, and even took up playing an instrument. I thought that would be the key to unlocking the door to a relationship. But still, nothing.\nI started to realize that it wasn't just about me, it was about finding someone who shared similar interests and values. So, I started attending events and gatherings where I could meet new people. I joined clubs and groups that aligned with my passions, and slowly but surely, I started to build connections.\nIt wasn't easy, and there were still times when I felt like I was stuck in a rut. But I didn't give up. I kept pushing forward, and eventually, I started to see progress. I met people who shared my interests, and we started to form meaningful connections.\nOf course, it's not like I suddenly became a social butterfly overnight. It took time, effort, and patience. But I learned that it's okay to take things at your own pace, and that it's not about trying to fit into someone else's mold. It's about being true to yourself and finding people who accept and appreciate you for who you are.\nSo, to anyone who's feeling like they're stuck in a rut, I'd say don't give up. Keep pushing forward, and don't be afraid to try new things. You never know who you might meet or what experiences you might have.

Online dating hasn't even produced one date, and it's not looking good.\nIt just feels awful knowing there's a whole new side of life I haven't experienced yet. When I get asked about my \"ex's\", I have to make something up or people would think I'm a freak.\nEDIT: I'm usually not obsessed with it and don't let it bring me down, but at times reality just takes over me and it really is overwhelming, and this is one of those times.\nBeanNCheeze: I felt like this at 18... I created what I thought girls liked.\nSo I lifted, lost weight, worked on upping my hygiene game (shaving/face care/ monthly haircut), got a job, ambitions, hobbies, practiced\n\nText continuation:\nsocializing. Upgraded my wardrobe to slim fit clothing.\nAll within 1 year.\nThere is dating game but I\u2019d complete the above before getting into that.\nGot a ton of tinder dates after I attained what I found ideal. Eventually my mentality turned from \u201cwhat do girls like?\u201d To \u201cwhat do I like? Who do I want to be?\u201d. While maintaining the above. \nBack to you, do you follow the above? \nBarcaLiverpool: What is the dating game and how do you change mindset of being shy \nearthgarden: shyness stems from low self-esteem combined with being self-centered.\nRaise your self-esteem and you will no longer be shy nor so intensely focused on yourself. When you feel good about yourself, you don't think negatively about yourself and thus you'll stop assuming others view you or will view you in a negative light. And if they do, so what you'll have the emotional stability to deal with someone rejecting you or not liking you.\nTo start raising your self-esteem, write down good things about yourself. Listen to the people who love you and who've been there. For example don't discount good things your mom or grandma has to say about you, they're not just saying it because.\nBarcaLiverpool: Very well said!\nI have made several significant changes in my lifestyle in order to better myself. I go to gym 4-5 days a week, have set meal plan, focused on hygiene, began reading books instead of surfing through internet \nBut even after these improvements I still have low self esteem. I can\u2019t/don\u2019t know how to change that. I frequently look at the mirror or take selfie to \u201ccheck myself out\u201d to see if I\u2019m okay. \nHow do I raise self esteem and build confidence? I know how to make lifestyle changes, it\u2019s the mindset change that\u2019s the problem for me \nHats_back: Did you make the changes in order to better yourself for you, or better yourself in the hopes of finding chicks? I found that focusing on yourself and making your life good without companionship is the key to finding companionship. You need to be self sufficient and happy with your own life to ever attract another healthy person who is okay with theirs! \nAll I can say is fake it \u2018til you make it. If you aren\u2019t confident then act like it anyways, feels natural after a while lol. \nBarcaLiverpool: Wise words. It\u2019s as if i knew \u201cthe secret\u201d all along. I just needed to hear it from someone else. Thanks mate\nHats_back: Well I\u2019m happy it helped in any way it could. It\u2019s almost like \u201cthe secret\u201d is that there isn\u2019t a secret and you just have to do it. It\u2019s harder than it sounds, and sometimes it\u2019s lonely, but when you feel lonely you can make a conscious effort to do something new. Random things can spark passion and that passion can be a magnet for other people. Just keep it up! :)\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Exploiting this alternative\n\nText continuation:\nrepresentation, Fast Downward can handle planning problems that are difficult or impossible to solve using traditional propositional planning systems.\nOne of the key features of Fast Downward is its ability to handle planning problems with complex constraints and effects. This is achieved through the use of a sophisticated planning algorithm that can efficiently explore the search space of possible solutions. The algorithm is based on a combination of heuristic search and constraint propagation, which allows it to prune the search space and focus on the most promising regions.\nFast Downward has been successfully applied to a wide range of planning problems, including problems from robotics, logistics, and manufacturing. It has also been used to solve complex planning problems that involve multiple agents and uncertain environments. In addition, Fast Downward has been integrated with other planning systems and tools, such as planning languages and planning domains, to provide a comprehensive planning solution.\nOverall, Fast Downward is a powerful and flexible planning system that can handle a wide range of planning problems. Its ability to handle complex constraints and effects, combined with its efficient planning algorithm, make it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Exploiting this alternative\n\nText continuation:\nrepresentation, Fast Downward uses hierarchical decompositions of planning tasks for computing its heuristic function, called the causal graph heuristic, which is very different from traditional HSP-like heuristics based on ignoring negative interactions of operators. In this article, we give a full account of Fast Downwards approach to solving multi-valued planning tasks. We extend our earlier discussion of the causal graph heuristic to tasks involving axioms and conditional effects and present some novel techniques for search control that are used within Fast Downwards best-first search algorithm: preferred operators transfer the idea of helpful actions from local search to global best-first search, deferred evaluation of heuristic functions mitigates the negative effect of large branching factors on search performance, and multi-heuristic best-first search combines several heuristic evaluation functions within a single search algorithm in an orthogonal way. We also describe efficient data structures for fast state expansion (successor generators and axiom evaluators) and present a new non-heuristic search algorithm called focused iterative-broadening search, which utilizes the information encoded in causal graphs in a novel way. Fast Downward has proven remarkably successful: It won the \"classical (i.e., propositional, non-optimising) track of the 4th International Planning Competition at ICAPS 2004, following in the footsteps of planners such as FF and LPG.

To investigate seismic wave amplification in such cases, past studies have been devoted to one-directional shear wave propagation in a soil column (1D-propagation) considering one motion component only (1C-polarization). Three independent purely 1C computations may be performed ('1D-1C' approach) and directly superimposed in the case of weak motions (linear behaviour). This research aims at studying local site effects by considering seismic wave propagation in a 1-D soil profile accounting for the influence of the 3-D loading path and non-linear hysteretic behaviour of the soil. In the proposed '1D-3C' approach, the three components (3C\n\nText continuation:\n) of the seismic motion are considered, allowing for the investigation of the soil's response to complex waveforms. By incorporating the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the non-linear behaviour of the soil, which is essential for understanding the local site effects and seismic wave amplification.\nThe '1D-3C' approach is particularly useful for studying the response of soil deposits to complex seismic waves, such as those generated by earthquakes or explosions. In these cases, the seismic waves may have multiple frequency components and polarizations, which can interact with the soil in complex ways. By considering the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the non-linear behaviour of the soil and provide a more accurate representation of the seismic wave amplification.\nIn addition, the '1D-3C' approach can be used to study the effects of soil non-linearity on seismic wave propagation. Soil non-linearity can arise from a variety of mechanisms, including the non-linear response of the soil to stress, the presence of cracks or fractures, and the interaction between the soil and other geological structures. By incorporating the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the non-linear behaviour of the soil and provide a more accurate representation of the seismic wave amplification.\nFurthermore, the '1D-3C' approach can be used to study the effects of site-specific conditions on seismic wave propagation. Site-specific conditions, such as the presence of a hard rock layer or a layer of loose soil, can significantly affect the response of the soil to seismic waves. By incorporating the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the effects of site-specific conditions and provide a more accurate representation of the seismic wave amplification.\nIn conclusion, the '1D-3C' approach is a powerful tool for studying local site effects and seismic wave amplification in soil deposits. By incorporating the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the non-linear behaviour of the soil and provide a more accurate representation of the seismic wave amplification. The approach can be used to study a wide range of problems, including the response of soil deposits to complex seismic waves, the effects of soil non-linearity on seismic wave propagation, and the effects of site-specific conditions on seismic wave propagation.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

This research aims at studying local site effects by considering seismic wave propagation in a 1-D soil profile accounting for the influence of the 3-D loading path and non-linear hysteretic behaviour of the soil. In the proposed '1D-3C' approach, the three components (3C\n\nText continuation:\n-polarization) of the incident wave are simultaneously propagated into a horizontal multilayered soil. A 3-D non-linear constitutive relation for the soil is implemented in the framework of the Finite Element Method in the time domain. The complex rheology of soils is modelled by mean of a multisurface cyclic plasticity model of the Masing-Prandtl-Ishlinskii-Iwan type. The great advantage of this choice is that the only data needed to describe the model is the modulus reduction curve. A parametric study is carried out to characterize the changes in the seismic motion of the surficial layers due to both incident wavefield properties and soil non-linearities. The numerical simulations show a seismic response depending on several parameters such as polarization of seismic waves, material elastic and dynamic properties, as well as on the impedance contrast between layers and frequency content and oscillatory character of the input motion. The 3-D loading path due to the 3C-polarization leads to multi-axial stress interaction that reduces soil strength and increases non-linear effects. The non-linear behaviour of the soil may have beneficial or detrimental effects on the seismic response at the free surface, depending on the energy dissipation rate. Free surface time histories, stress-strain hysteresis loops and in-depth profiles of octahedral stress and strain are estimated for each soil column. The combination of three separate 1D-1C non-linear analyses is compared to the proposed 1D-3C approach, evidencing the influence of the 3C-polarization and the 3-D loading path on strong seismic motions.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

German and Japanese warships and submarines entered Australian waters between 1940 and 1945 and attacked ships, ports and other targets. Among the best-known attacks are the sinking of HMAS Sydney by a German raider in November 1941, the bombing of Darwin by Japanese naval aircraft in February 1942, and the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour in May 1942. About 40 Allied merchant ships were damaged or sunk off the Australian coast by surface raiders, submarines and mines. Japanese submarines also shelled three Australian ports and submarine-based aircraft flew over several Australian capital cities.\nThe Axis threat to Australia\n\nText continuation:\nwas a significant concern for the Australian government and military. In response, Australia implemented a range of measures to defend its coastline and shipping lanes. These included the establishment of coastal patrols, the deployment of anti-submarine warfare vessels, and the implementation of convoy systems to protect merchant ships. Additionally, Australia worked closely with its allies, including the United States, to share intelligence and coordinate naval operations.\nDespite these efforts, the Axis threat remained a significant challenge for Australia throughout the war. The country's remote location made it difficult to detect and respond to enemy attacks, and the Japanese and German navies were able to exploit this to launch surprise attacks on Australian targets. However, the Australian military and government were able to adapt and respond to these challenges, and the country played an important role in the Allied war effort. The Axis threat to Australia ultimately subsided in 1945, following the defeat of Germany and Japan, but the war had a lasting impact on the country's military and naval capabilities, as well as its national identity and sense of purpose.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The level of Axis naval activity peaked in the first half of 1942 when Japanese submarines conducted anti-shipping patrols off Australia's coast, and Japanese naval aviation attacked several towns in northern Australia. The Japanese submarine offensive against Australia was renewed in the first half of 1943 but was broken off as the Allies pushed the Japanese onto the defensive. Few Axis naval vessels operated in Australian waters in 1944 and 1945, and those that did had only a limited impact.\nDue to the episodic nature of the Axis attacks and the relatively small number of ships and submarines committed, Germany and Japan were not successful in disrupting Australian shipping. While the Allies were forced to deploy substantial assets to defend shipping in Australian waters, this did not have a significant impact on the Australian war effort or American-led operations in the South West Pacific Area.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Semantic clustering is one such technique for modularization of the system that relies on the informal semantics of the program, encoded in the vocabulary used in the source code. Treating the source code as a collection of tokens loses the semantic information embedded within the identifiers. We try to overcome this problem by introducing context models for source code identifiers to obtain a semantic kernel, which can be used for both deriving the topics that run through the system as well as their clustering. In the first model, we abstract an identifier to its type representation and build on this notion of context to construct contextual\n\nText continuation:\nrepresentations for each identifier. These representations are then used to compute the semantic similarity between identifiers, which is crucial for identifying the relationships between them.\nBy using contextual representations, we can capture the nuances of the program's semantics, such as the relationships between variables, functions, and classes. This allows us to identify the topics that are relevant to the program's functionality, and to cluster the identifiers based on their semantic similarity. In addition, we can also use these contextual representations to compute the semantic distance between identifiers, which can be used to identify the most similar or dissimilar identifiers in the program.\nOur approach has several advantages over traditional approaches to program comprehension. Firstly, it allows us to capture the semantic information embedded in the source code, which is essential for understanding the program's behavior and functionality. Secondly, it provides a more accurate and nuanced representation of the program's semantics, which can be used to identify the relationships between identifiers and to cluster them based on their semantic similarity. Finally, it can be used to compute the semantic distance between identifiers, which can be used to identify the most similar or dissimilar identifiers in the program.\nIn future work, we plan to extend our approach to include additional features, such as the program's control flow and data flow, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the program's behavior and functionality. We also plan to evaluate our approach on a larger scale, using a variety of programming languages and programming paradigms, to demonstrate its effectiveness and versatility.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The second notion of context is defined based on the flow of data between identifiers to represent a module as a dependency graph where the nodes correspond to identifiers and the edges represent the data dependencies between pairs of identifiers. We have applied our approach to 10 medium-sized open source Java projects, and show that by introducing contexts for identifiers, the quality of the modularization of the software systems is improved. Both of the context models give results that are superior to the plain vector representation of documents. In some cases, the authoritativeness of decompositions is improved by 67%. Furthermore, a more detailed evaluation of our approach on JEdit, an open source editor, demonstrates that inferred topics through performing topic analysis on the contextual representations are more meaningful compared to the plain representation of the documents. The proposed approach in introducing a context model for source code identifiers paves the way for building tools that support developers in program comprehension tasks such as application and domain concept location, software modularization and topic analysis.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

But she wasn't looking for the perfect safari lodge. She was hunting for the right cosmetic surgeon. When she told her family, it wasn't an easy sell. \"South Africa? You're going to get some kind of witch doctor,\" she recalls her father saying. \"But I told him they perfected some of the first heart surgeries down there. To me, South Africa had the most reputable surgeons.\" Hiltbrunner, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, traveled to Johannesburg in 2004 for a face-lift, upper arm lift and eyelid surgery. And she and her husband -- who hadn't taken a vacation in 20 years -- went on a luxury safari, included in the package by medical-travel agency Surgeon and Safari. \"Medical tourism\" may sound strange, but patients are discovering they can get some cosmetic surgeries abroad for less than the U.S. price. And many surgeries include sightseeing packages. The roster of countries in which hospitals and surgeons are marketing their services to foreigners is growing. South Africa, Argentina, Thailand, Brazil, Costa Rica, India and Singapore have become major players. Robert Painter, a travel writer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, journeyed last year to Argentina for dental surgeries -- and tango lessons: \"If I'm going to be stuck somewhere for two weeks at a time, twice, Buenos Aires has got to be the best possible place,\" he says . Painter's procedures were organized by Plenitas, a medical-travel facilitator in Buenos Aires, which booked him at a hotel with a dance studio in the back. He wasn't the only guest getting surgery: \"While I was there, there was a young lady who was also having implants -- though not of the dental type.\" Cost-cutting pros and cons . Cosmetic, or elective, procedures aren't covered by insurance, so cost remains the motivating factor for most medical tourists. Surgeries in many countries cost half or even one-fifth what they would in the U.S. -- including airfare, hotel and excursions. \"A full face-lift that would cost $20,000 in the U.S. runs about $1,250 in South Africa,\" a 2005 article in U-Daily, the University of Delaware's online news service noted. Faith Richter, of Hope Sound, Florida, got a face-lift in Bangkok, Thailand. Her trip was organized by New York City's Med Journeys. \"In the U.S., it would have cost $20,000 for the procedure alone, with no time in the hospital,\" she says. In Bangkok, Richter was in the hospital four days, and the total cost of her 19-day trip, including sightseeing and airfare for two, was $10,600. Painter estimates he saved $18,000 on his surgeries. \"Cost was the primary factor,\" he says. \"The only factor.\" Medical costs abroad are less than in the U.S. for many reasons -- favorable exchange rates, lower salaries and fewer medical lawsuits, which means lower malpractice-insurance costs. But the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery warns against low-cost surgery. \"Get bargains on your shoes and laundry detergent, not on your face,\" says spokesman Tony Staffieri. \"Researching the quality of doctors should be a patient's primary consideration, but it isn't always,\" he says. \"Some people think 'tummy tuck and shopping.' This is not makeup; it's somebody cutting you.\" Some medical professionals fear that patients will overlook the severity of invasive surgeries and fail to ask the right questions. More casual attitudes toward plastic surgery -- spurred by lunch-break Botox treatments and same-day liposuctions, paired with temptingly cheap alternatives and vacation packages -- increase the risk of bad outcomes. Even stateside, cosmetic surgery can have tragic results. \"First Wives Club\" author Olivia Goldsmith died during a chin-tuck in 2004, and this year Kanye West's mother, Donda, died after a tummy tuck and breast reduction. However, a 2004 study published in the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, found that \"deaths occurring at office-based surgery facilities (in the U.S.) are rare -- less than a quarter of a percent.\" Quality surgeons . Medical tourism experts counter criticism by saying that cheaper prices don't necessarily mean lower quality of care. \"In general, it is the hospitals and facilities that have justifiable claim to 'world-class' status or to meeting or exceeding U.S. standards that are competing for patients from the United States and other countries,\" says Jeff Schult, author of \"Beauty from Afar: A Medical Tourist's Guide to Affordable and Quality Cosmetic Care Outside the U.S.\" The authors of a 2006 \"New England Journal of Medicine\" article confirm the high standards of internationally accredited hospitals: \"We doubt (...) that the average U.S. hospital can offer better outcomes for common complex operations.\" \"Almost 80 percent of the doctors we use have been trained in the U.S. or U.K.,\" says Tim Wallace, vice president of sales and marketing for Med Journeys. \"It gives the American consumer a degree of confidence.\" Richter, a registered nurse, agrees that standards are high abroad. \"After the surgery, the nurses were there for me 100 percent,\" she says. \"At home, we're so understaffed and overburdened, and inundated with paperwork.\" When Painter visited U.S. dentists, \"I felt like I was being processed for a home loan,\" he says. \"In Argentina, I had three dentists working on me at once.\" While medical tourism continues to increase in popularity, it's still not mainstream. When Richter left for Bangkok, she \"didn't tell a soul, not even my seven children, who are almost all in the medical field.

But she wasn't looking for the perfect safari lodge. She was hunting for the right cosmetic surgeon. When she told her family, it wasn't an easy sell. \"South Africa? You're going to get some kind of witch doctor,\" she recalls her father saying. \"But I told him they perfected some of the first heart surgeries down there. To me, South Africa had the most reputable surgeons.\" Hiltbrunner, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, traveled to Johannesburg in 2004 for a face-lift, upper arm lift and eyelid surgery. And she and her husband -- who hadn't taken a vacation in 20 years -- went on a luxury safari, included in the package by medical-travel agency Surgeon and Safari. \"Medical tourism\" may sound strange, but patients are discovering they can get some cosmetic surgeries abroad for less than the U.S. price. And many surgeries include sightseeing packages. The roster of countries in which hospitals and surgeons are marketing their services to foreigners is growing. South Africa, Argentina, Thailand, Brazil, Costa Rica, India and Singapore have become major players. Robert Painter, a travel writer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, journeyed last year to Argentina for dental surgeries -- and tango lessons: \"If I'm going to be stuck somewhere for two weeks at a time, twice, Buenos Aires has got to be the best possible place,\" he says . Painter's procedures were organized by Plenitas, a medical-travel facilitator in Buenos Aires, which booked him at a hotel with a dance studio in the back. He wasn't the only guest getting surgery: \"While I was there, there was a young lady who was also having implants -- though not of the dental type.\" Cost-cutting pros and cons . Cosmetic, or elective, procedures aren't covered by insurance, so cost remains the motivating factor for most medical tourists. Surgeries in many countries cost half or even one-fifth what they would in the U.S. -- including airfare, hotel and excursions. \"A full face-lift that would cost $20,000 in the U.S. runs about $1,250 in South Africa,\" a 2005 article in U-Daily, the University of Delaware's online news service noted. Faith Richter, of Hope Sound, Florida, got a face-lift in Bangkok, Thailand. Her trip was organized by New York City's Med Journeys. \"In the U.S., it would have cost $20,000 for the procedure alone, with no time in the hospital,\" she says. In Bangkok, Richter was in the hospital four days, and the total cost of her 19-day trip, including sightseeing and airfare for two, was $10,600. Painter estimates he saved $18,000 on his surgeries. \"Cost was the primary factor,\" he says. \"The only factor.\" Medical costs abroad are less than in the U.S. for many reasons -- favorable exchange rates, lower salaries and fewer medical lawsuits, which means lower malpractice-insurance costs. But the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery warns against low-cost surgery. \"Get bargains on your shoes and laundry detergent, not on your face,\" says spokesman Tony Staffieri. \"Researching the quality of doctors should be a patient's primary consideration, but it isn't always,\" he says. \"Some people think 'tummy tuck and shopping.' This is not makeup; it's somebody cutting you.\" Some medical professionals fear that patients will overlook the severity of invasive surgeries and fail to ask the right questions. More casual attitudes toward plastic surgery -- spurred by lunch-break Botox treatments and same-day liposuctions, paired with temptingly cheap alternatives and vacation packages -- increase the risk of bad outcomes. Even stateside, cosmetic surgery can have tragic results. \"First Wives Club\" author Olivia Goldsmith died during a chin-tuck in 2004, and this year Kanye West's mother, Donda, died after a tummy tuck and breast reduction. However, a 2004 study published in the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, found that \"deaths occurring at office-based surgery facilities (in the U.S.) are rare -- less than a quarter of a percent.\" Quality surgeons . Medical tourism experts counter criticism by saying that cheaper prices don't necessarily mean lower quality of care. \"In general, it is the hospitals and facilities that have justifiable claim to 'world-class' status or to meeting or exceeding U.S. standards that are competing for patients from the United States and other countries,\" says Jeff Schult, author of \"Beauty from Afar: A Medical Tourist's Guide to Affordable and Quality Cosmetic Care Outside the U.S.\" The authors of a 2006 \"New England Journal of Medicine\" article confirm the high standards of internationally accredited hospitals: \"We doubt (...) that the average U.S. hospital can offer better outcomes for common complex operations.\" \"Almost 80 percent of the doctors we use have been trained in the U.S. or U.K.,\" says Tim Wallace, vice president of sales and marketing for Med Journeys. \"It gives the American consumer a degree of confidence.\" Richter, a registered nurse, agrees that standards are high abroad. \"After the surgery, the nurses were there for me 100 percent,\" she says. \"At home, we're so understaffed and overburdened, and inundated with paperwork.\" When Painter visited U.S. dentists, \"I felt like I was being processed for a home loan,\" he says. \"In Argentina, I had three dentists working on me at once.\" While medical tourism continues to increase in popularity, it's still not mainstream. When Richter left for Bangkok, she \"didn't tell a soul, not even my seven children, who are almost all in the medical field. They would have had a stroke. \"At Thanksgiving, though, they were all saying, 'You really do look good.'\" E-mail to a friend . LifeWire provides original and syndicated content to web publishers.

The method, based on Nitroxide-Mediated Polymerization (NMP), consists to bind covalently the alkoxyamine, which acts as initiator controller agent, at the silica nanoparticles surface in two steps. The first step is a reaction between the aminopropylsilane and the silica particles in order to functionalize the particles surface with amino group. In a second step, the initiating-controlling alkoxyamine moiety is introduced via an over grafting reaction between the amino group and the N-hydroxysuccinimide based MAMA-SG1 activated ester. To simplify both their chemical transformation and the polymerization step, the native silica particles, initially dispersed in water\n\nText continuation:\n, are first modified with aminopropylsilane to introduce amino groups on their surface. This modification enables the subsequent covalent binding of the alkoxyamine moiety, which serves as both an initiator and a controller for the polymerization reaction.\nThe resulting PS-silica nanoparticles exhibit a well-defined structure and a high degree of dispersion, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including biomedicine, catalysis, and optoelectronics. The grafting-from approach used in this method offers several advantages, including the ability to control the size and shape of the nanoparticles, as well as the molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymer chains. Additionally, the use of NMP allows for the synthesis of well-defined polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions, which is critical for many applications.\nFurthermore, the grafting-from method enables the incorporation of functional groups into the polymer chains, which can be used to tailor the properties of the nanoparticles. For example, the incorporation of hydrophilic groups can improve the dispersion of the nanoparticles in aqueous media, while the incorporation of hydrophobic groups can enhance their compatibility with organic solvents. The versatility of this method makes it an attractive approach for the synthesis of PS-silica nanoparticles with tailored properties for specific applications.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

To simplify both their chemical transformation and the polymerization step, the native silica particles, initially dispersed in water\n\nText continuation:\n, have been transferred in an organic solvent, the dimethylacetamide, which is also a good solvent for the polystyrene. The synthesis parameters have been optimized for grafting density, conversion rates, and synthesis reproducibility while keeping the colloidal stability and to avoid any aggregation of silica particles induced by the inter-particles interaction evolution during the synthesis. After synthesis, the final grafted objects have been purified and the non-grafted polymer chains formed in the solvent have been washed out by ultra filtration. Then the particles have been studied using Small angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) coupled to neutron contrast variation method. To optimize the contrast conditions, both hydrogenated and deuterated monomers have been used for the synthesis. A refined fitting analysis based on the comparison on two models, a basic core-shell and the Gaussian Pedersen model, enables us to fit nicely the experimental data for both the hydrogenated and deuterated grafted case. Differences are seen between grafting of normal or deuterated chains which can be due to monomer reactivity or to neutron contrast effect variations. The synthesis and the characterization method established in this work constitute a robust and reproducible way to design well defined grafted polymer nanoparticles. These objects will be incorporated in polymer matrices in a further step to create Nanocomposites for polymer reinforcement.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

He apologised if what he said made me feel uncomfortable, I just told him we're good now but I just don't want that stuff.\nI know how to set my boundaries but I'm a bit unsure how to assert my stance to him permanently. Should I not include him next time he seems lost? Is my friendliness doomed to be an invitation in his eyes? No one else in our course does anything to include him and I feel so bad about that. It's very unnatural to me to not include people like that but I guess I have to dismiss him more since he seems to interpret me wrong every time, right?

Should I say something more to him about this? \nI am going to meet him like multiple times a week for the next 4 years in our tiny ass class so I can't do anything crazy. I'm so stressed out about this. \nTL;DR a classic story: I was friendly to a loner guy in my class, he asked me out, I turned him down, he continues flirting. Should I be colder towards him because being a friendly seems to encourage him?\nnopiepoopi: I just wanted to say I think it could be worth bringing up with your other friends/classmates how they don\u2019t include him. \nJust discuss with them and ask them why they don\u2019t include him. Is there any reason? Are they genuinely just overlooking him? If so, maybe they can help you with including him too. I don\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t unless they\u2019re purposefully excluding him, and if that\u2019s the case, there should be a good reason as to why they\u2019re excluding him. \nIt would be nice for everyone to put in efforts to include others, is all.\nsplashysoup: That sounds good. Our class has a good vibe in general and everybody else is included at least to the extent that no one else is left outside groups like he is. We also have certain people who are chosen to be sort of \"equality contacts\" (or whatever the English equivalent is) in our class so maybe I'll bring up the issue with them for the very least.\nnopiepoopi: Sounds good!!\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

More cameras, more applications tracking your every move and restrictions of personal electronic devices. But right now, due to increasing shutdowns, me and many many other customer service reps are sitting at home without a camera taking dozens if not hundreds of people's credit card information daily.\nCable network providers, phone service providers, clothing companies and many other businesses are allowing their representatives to take your card information at home without any knowledge whatsoever of what they are doing with\n\nText continuation:\nit. I'm not sure if this is a temporary measure to accommodate the work-from-home setup or if it's a permanent change, but it's definitely raised some red flags for me.\nAs a former customer support representative, I can attest that security protocols were always in place to ensure the safety of customer data. We had to follow strict guidelines and protocols to handle sensitive information, and we were constantly monitored to ensure compliance. But now, it seems like those safeguards are being compromised.\nI'm not saying that every representative is reckless or untrustworthy, but the lack of oversight and security measures is concerning. What's to stop someone from misusing or selling the credit card information they're collecting? It's not just about the individual representatives; it's about the companies themselves and their responsibility to protect customer data.\nI've heard stories of representatives being asked to work from home without any additional security measures in place. They're given a laptop and a headset, and they're expected to handle sensitive information without any supervision. It's like they're being asked to work in a vacuum, with no accountability or oversight.\nI'm not sure what the solution is, but I think it's time for companies to re-evaluate their security protocols and ensure that they're doing everything they can to protect customer data. Maybe it's time for them to invest in additional security measures, such as encryption and two-factor authentication. Maybe it's time for them to implement stricter guidelines and protocols for handling sensitive information.\nAs a customer, it's hard to know what to do. Do you trust that your credit card information is being handled securely, or do you take extra precautions to protect yourself? Do you ask questions about security protocols when you're speaking with a representative, or do you assume that everything is being handled properly?\nI don't have the answers, but I do know that something needs to change. Companies need to take customer data security seriously, and they need to ensure that their representatives are equipped to handle sensitive information in a secure and responsible manner. Until then, I'll be taking extra precautions to protect my own credit card information, and I'll be keeping a close eye on the companies I do business with.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Although the plant response to environmental stresses is characterized by both architectural and functional plasticity, recent attempts to integrate biological knowledge into genetics models have mainly concerned specific physiological processes or crop models without architecture, and thus may prove limited when studying genotype x environment interactions. Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study introducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives access to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection and thus to promising tools for yield optimization\n\nText continuation:\n.\nBy incorporating genetics into the functional-structural growth model, we can better understand the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and ultimately yield. This approach allows us to simulate the behavior of different genotypes under various environmental conditions, enabling the prediction of phenotypic traits and the identification of QTL associated with these traits. The integration of genetics and functional-structural growth modeling also provides a framework for understanding how genetic variation affects plant architecture and function, which is essential for optimizing crop yields.\nThe functional-structural growth model used in this study is based on the concept of functional-structural plant modeling, which combines detailed descriptions of plant architecture and function with simulations of environmental conditions. This approach allows us to simulate the behavior of plants at the individual organ level, taking into account factors such as light, temperature, and water availability. The inclusion of genetics in this model enables us to simulate the effects of genetic variation on plant development and yield, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.\nThe simulation study presented in this paper demonstrates the potential of integrating genetics and functional-structural growth modeling to predict phenotypic traits and identify QTL associated with these traits. The results show that the genetic component of the model can accurately predict the behavior of different genotypes under various environmental conditions, and that the integration of genetics and functional-structural growth modeling can provide valuable insights into the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and yield. These findings have important implications for the development of breeding strategies and the optimization of crop yields, and highlight the potential of this approach for improving our understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and yield.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study introducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives access to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection and thus to promising tools for yield optimization\n\nText continuation:\n. Methods: The GreenLab model was selected as a reasonable choice to link growth model parameters to QTL. Virtual genes and virtual chromosomes were defined to build a simple genetic model that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model. The QTL Cartographer software was used to study QTL detection of simulated plant traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotype for yield maximization based on the model parameters and the associated allelic combination. Key Results and Conclusions: By keeping the environmental factors constant and using a virtual population with a large number of individuals generated by a Mendelian genetic model, results for an ideal case could be simulated. Virtual QTL detection was compared in the case of phenotypic traits - such as cob weight - and when traits were model parameters, and was found to be more accurate in the latter case. The practical interest of this approach is illustrated by calculating the parameters (and the corresponding genotype) associated with yield optimization of a GreenLab maize model. The paper discusses the potentials of GreenLab to represent environment x genotype interactions, in particular through its main state variable, the ratio of biomass supply over demand.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

This language can be problematic, as it perpetuates a harmful narrative that people with sickle cell disease are somehow less worthy or inferior. By reframing the conversation to focus on the genetic advantage conferred by sickle cell disease, we can begin to challenge these harmful assumptions and work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.\nMoreover, it's essential to recognize that the concept of \"defect\" is often tied to societal and cultural norms, rather than being an objective scientific fact. For instance, in many parts of the world, people with sickle cell disease are not stigmatized or viewed as having a defect, but rather as having a unique set of characteristics that are valued and respected. This highlights the importance of considering the cultural and social contexts in which we use language and make decisions about genetic modification.\nUltimately, the debate surrounding CRISPR and sickle cell disease is not simply about whether the condition is a defect or an advantage, but rather about how we choose to value and prioritize human life. By acknowledging the complex and multifaceted nature of this issue, we can work towards a more nuanced and compassionate understanding of what it means to be human.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In that situation, would you have preferred to worry about your risk of malaria, or about permanent tissue damage and, once again, intractable pain lasting days or longer? Because you see, I'm quite sure that you've never once seriously worried you might die of malaria, but you've enjoyed at least some amount of time without chronic pain and the impending doom if an early death from an incurable genetic disorder...\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The State would then be the guarantor in order to facilitate their access to financing, also reduced by Basel III and Solvency II. This policy develops a system of reallocation of financing capacities from non-virtuous companies to the most virtuous ones with public guarantees, aiming to reduce the debt ratio while increasing green investments, with monetary policies of rates but also of volumes and ratios differentiated according to the types of assets and the greening of bank balance sheets, and finally forms of public-private partnership. Facilitating the financing of green companies would green capital but increase it, partly neutralising the positive environmental impact. It is therefore necessary to limit the credit expansion of ''brown'' companies. This would reduce risky operations and favour less leveraged investments more connected to the real economy, reducing systemic financial risk. -- The Agenda 2030 Policy Briefs series (PoCFiN Kedge Business School - SDSN France - Institut Rousseau) mobilises economists and practitioners to identify an agenda of economic and financial reforms to achieve the 2030 Agenda, at territorial, national and supranational levels.

They also have a ton of information on their website about how to use the ingredients and how to mix them together to get the desired results.\nOne of the things I love about Making Cosmetics is that they have a wide range of products, from natural and organic options to more synthetic ingredients. This is great for people who have specific skin types or allergies, as you can choose ingredients that are gentle and non-irritating. They also have a great selection of fragrances and essential oils, which you can use to customize the scent of your products.\nAnother benefit of buying ingredients from Making Cosmetics is that you can customize the products to your specific needs. For example, if you have dry skin, you can add more moisturizing ingredients to your products. If you have oily skin, you can use ingredients that help to control oil production. This level of customization is hard to find in commercial products, which often have a one-size-fits-all approach.\nIn addition to the ingredients, Making Cosmetics also has a lot of great tutorials and recipes on their website. These can be super helpful if you're new to making your own products, as they provide step-by-step instructions on how to mix and use the ingredients. They also have a great community of users who share their own recipes and tips, which can be a great resource for inspiration and guidance.\nOverall, I've been really happy with my experience using Making Cosmetics. The prices are great, the selection is huge, and the community is super supportive. If you're interested in making your own personal care products, I would definitely recommend checking them out.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The Texan family is trying to provide a more comfortable home and upbringing for these children. The Native American tribe is trying to preserve its culture. I don't fault the Texans for anything they're doing, except perhaps for the implicit assumption that a wealthier up-bringing is inherently superior to poorer childhood (wealth certainly is in advantage, but I don't think it's causally related to child happiness). I also don't fault the native American tribe for anything they're doing, with the history of explicit attempts to wipe out their cultural identity in the past. And in the middle, a brother and sister are separated by these two pulls.\nEdit: typos\n\nText continuation:\nAs the debate continues, it's essential to acknowledge the complex emotions and motivations involved. The Texan family, driven by a desire to provide a loving home, may not fully comprehend the cultural significance of preserving Native American heritage. Conversely, the Native American tribe, seeking to protect their children's cultural identity, may not fully grasp the emotional needs of the children themselves. Caught in the middle are the children, who are forced to navigate two vastly different worlds, torn between the comfort and security of their adoptive family and the cultural connection to their biological heritage.\nThe issue at hand is not solely about adoption or cultural preservation, but about the fundamental right of children to know and connect with their roots. The question remains: what is the best way to ensure that Native American children are able to grow up with a strong sense of identity and cultural connection? Should it be through adoption by a loving family, or through preservation of their cultural heritage within their own community?\nAs the debate rages on, it's crucial to remember that the fate of these children is not just a matter of legal or cultural significance, but also a matter of human compassion and empathy. The Texan family, the Native American tribe, and the children themselves all deserve our understanding, respect, and support.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The Texan family is trying to provide a more comfortable home and upbringing for these children. The Native American tribe is trying to preserve its culture. I don't fault the Texans for anything they're doing, except perhaps for the implicit assumption that a wealthier up-bringing is inherently superior to poorer childhood (wealth certainly is in advantage, but I don't think it's causally related to child happiness). I also don't fault the native American tribe for anything they're doing, with the history of explicit attempts to wipe out their cultural identity in the past. And in the middle, a brother and sister are separated by these two pulls.\nEdit: typos\n\nText continuation:\ncorrected\nlexabear: I fault the Texan family. I don't believe they're acting maliciously, but that doesn't mean that they can't be faulted. They assume that the only way to help these children is for *them* to take them away from their family and raise them themselves. \nSpecifically, this quote where the adoptive family discusses adopting the child's sister from the original family:\n&gt; I\u2019m a little bit concerned with the limited financial resources possibly to care for this child, should an emergency come up.\nAnother solution would be to *provide a better social net for the original family*, not just to take their children because they're poor. And yet that solution doesn't even seem to be on the table. \nTo say \"I have more money for you, so I can do a better job bringing up your children, so I should be able to take them\" is imperialism at its worst. Should a Russian oligarch have been able to just take me away from my parents, because they had more money?\ncrouching_tiger: But they aren\u2019t taking the child away from *his* family, they fostered the child after the state took him from his mother due to drug use.\nThey tried to adopt him, but a law is in place giving preference to native tribes over anyone else to then adopt. \nThe wealth argument is entirely separate. They are just arguing they could provide a better life than the other native family that wanted to adopt him.\nsuperspiffyusername: Actually they have adopted him. The lawsuit is over adopting his sister, whom they have not raised.\nRancerle: Wait, who allowed the kids to be in separate situations in the first place?  Why aren't the siblings just together on either side of this situation as a rule?\nsuperspiffyusername: Listen, I don't want to be rude, but I'm a little frustrated here. The article is right there. I don't have any information that isn't in the article. Read it carefully, and you'll have as many answers as I do. \n-In more general terms, siblings are frequently in different placements, and there's as many different reasons for it as there are children. I don't think there's a good why here.

The Stream API introduces two key abstractions. The stream, which is a sequence of elements available in a data source, and the stream pipeline, which contains operations (e.g., map, filter, reduce) that are applied to the elements in the stream upon execution. Streams are getting popular among Java developers as they leverage the conciseness of functional programming and ease the parallelization of data processing. Despite the benefits of streams, in comparison to data processing relying on imperative code, streams can introduce significant overheads which are mainly caused by extra object allocations and reclamations, and\n\nText continuation:\nalso, the creation of intermediate streams and the evaluation of the stream operations can lead to increased memory usage.\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you need to process a large dataset and apply multiple operations to it. In imperative programming, you would typically use loops and conditional statements to achieve this. However, with streams, you can define a pipeline of operations that are applied to the dataset in a declarative manner. This can lead to more concise and readable code, but it can also lead to increased memory usage and object creation.\nTo mitigate these overheads, it's essential to understand the characteristics of your data and the operations you're applying to it. For example, if you're working with a large dataset and you're applying multiple filtering operations, you may want to consider using parallel streams to take advantage of multi-core processors and improve performance.\nAnother important consideration is the use of lazy evaluation in streams. By default, streams are lazily evaluated, which means that operations are only executed when the stream is actually consumed. This can lead to improved performance and reduced memory usage, as only the necessary data is processed. However, it can also lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful, as the stream pipeline may not be executed as expected.\nIn addition to these considerations, it's also important to be mindful of the type of operations you're applying to your streams. For example, if you're using a map operation to transform your data, you may want to consider using a parallel map operation to take advantage of multi-core processors and improve performance.\nIn conclusion, while streams can introduce significant overheads, they also offer many benefits in terms of conciseness, readability, and parallelization. By understanding the characteristics of your data and the operations you're applying to it, you can effectively use streams to improve the performance and efficiency of your Java applications.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

As a result, developers need means to study the runtime behavior of streams in the goal of both mitigating such abstraction overheads and optimizing stream processing. Unfortunately, there is a lack of dedicated tools able to dynamically analyze streams to help developers specifically locate issues degrading application performance. In this paper, we address the profiling and optimization of streams. We present a novel profiling technique for measuring the computations performed by a stream in terms of elapsed reference cycles, which we use to locate problematic streams with a major impact on application performance. While accuracy is crucial to this end, the inserted instrumentation code causes the execution of extra cycles, which are partially included in the profiles. To mitigate this issue, we estimate and compensate for the extra cycles caused by the inserted instrumentation code. We implement our approach in StreamProf that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first dedicated stream profiler for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). With StreamProf, we find that cycle profiling is effective to detect problematic streams whose optimization can enable significant performance gains. We also find that the accurate profiling of tasks supporting parallel stream processing allows the diagnosis of load imbalance according to the distribution of stream-related cycles at a thread level. We conduct an evaluation on sequential and parallel stream-based workloads that are publicly available in three different sources. The evaluation shows that our profiling technique is efficient and yields accurate profiles. Moreover, we show the actionability of our profiles by guiding stream-related optimizations on two workloads from Renaissance. Our optimizations require the modification of only a few lines of code while achieving speedups up to a factor of 5x. Java streams have been extensively studied by recent work, focusing on both how developers are using streams and how to optimize them. Current approaches in the optimization of streams mainly rely on static analysis techniques that overlook runtime information, suffer from important limitations to detect all streams executed by a Java application, or are not suitable for the analysis of parallel streams. Understanding the dynamic behavior of both sequential and parallel stream processing and its impact on application performance is crucial to help users make better decisions while using streams.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Detection of RFC1 expansion is challenging and CANVAS can be associated with atypical features. We clinically and genetically characterized 50 patients, selected based on the presence of sensory neuronopathy confirmed by EMG. We screened RFC1 expansion by PCR, repeat-primed PCR, and Southern blotting of long-range PCR products, a newly developed method. Neuropathological characterization was performed on the brain and spinal cord of one patient. Most patients (88%) carried a biallelic (AAGGG)n expansion in RFC1. In addition to the core CANVAS phenotype (sensory neuronopathy, cerebellar syndrome, and vestibular impairment), we observed chronic cough (97%), oculomotor signs (85%), motor neuron involvement\n\nText continuation:\n(70%), and a high frequency of cognitive impairment (60%). The patients' ages at onset ranged from 10 to 55 years, with a median age of 25 years. The disease course was characterized by a gradual progression of symptoms, with most patients experiencing significant disability within 5-10 years of onset.\nNotably, we found that the presence of chronic cough was significantly associated with the presence of oculomotor signs (p < 0.01), suggesting that these two symptoms may be related. Additionally, we observed a significant correlation between the number of repeats in the RFC1 gene and the age at onset of symptoms (r = 0.43, p < 0.01), with patients carrying more repeats tend to present at an earlier age. These findings suggest that the expansion size may play a role in determining the clinical phenotype and age at onset of CANVAS.\nThe neuropathological examination of the brain and spinal cord of one patient revealed widespread degeneration of sensory neurons, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of sensory neuronopathy. The examination also showed evidence of axonal degeneration and demyelination in the peripheral nervous system, which may contribute to the development of motor neuron involvement and chronic cough. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering CANVAS in the differential diagnosis of patients with sensory neuronopathy and provide further insights into the clinical and genetic features of this disorder.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Mixed motor and sensory neuronopathy was observed in 19% of patients. Among six non-RFC1 patients, one carried a heterozygous AAGGG expansion and a pathogenic variant in GRM1. Neuropathological examination of one RFC1 patient with an enriched phenotype, including parkinsonism, dysautonomia, and cognitive decline, showed posterior column and lumbar posterior root atrophy. Degeneration of the vestibulospinal and spinocerebellar tracts was mild. We observed marked astrocytic gliosis and axonal swelling of the synapse between first and second motor neurons in the anterior horn at the lumbar level. The cerebellum showed mild depletion of Purkinje cells, with empty baskets, torpedoes, and astrogliosis characterized by a disorganization of the Bergmann's radial glia. We found neuronal loss in the vagal nucleus. The pars compacta of the substantia nigra was depleted, with widespread Lewy bodies in the locus coeruleus, substantia nigra, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. We propose new guidelines for the screening of RFC1 expansion, considering different expansion motifs. Here, we developed a new method to more easily detect pathogenic RFC1 expansions. We report frequent motor neuron involvement and different neuronopathy subtypes. Parkinsonism was more prevalent in this cohort than in the general population, 10% versus the expected 1% (p < .001). We describe, for the first time, the spinal cord pathology in CANVAS, showing the alteration of posterior columns and roots, astrocytic gliosis and axonal swelling, suggesting motor neuron synaptic dysfunction.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Many programming languages offer a variety of container implementations in their standard libraries based on data structures offering different capabilities and performance characteristics. Inquiry: Choosing the *best* container for an application is not always straightforward, as performance characteristics can change drastically in different scenarios, and as real-world performance is not always correlated to theoretical complexity. Approach: We present Primrose, a language-agnostic tool for selecting the best performing valid container implementation from a set of container data types that satisfy *properties\n\nText continuation:\n*.\nPrimrose uses a combination of techniques, including benchmarking, profiling, and machine learning algorithms, to identify the most suitable container implementation for a given application. The tool is designed to be highly flexible, allowing developers to easily integrate it into their development workflow and to adapt it to their specific needs. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the performance characteristics of different container implementations, Primrose helps developers make informed decisions about which container to use in their application.\nOne of the key benefits of Primrose is its ability to consider a wide range of factors that can affect the performance of a container implementation. These factors include the size and complexity of the data being stored, the frequency and pattern of data access, and the specific requirements of the application. By taking these factors into account, Primrose can provide a more accurate and relevant assessment of the performance characteristics of different container implementations.\nIn addition to its technical capabilities, Primrose is also designed to be easy to use and integrate into a development workflow. The tool provides a simple and intuitive interface that allows developers to easily specify the requirements of their application and to view the results of the analysis. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily identify the most suitable container implementation for their application.\nOverall, Primrose is a powerful tool that can help developers make informed decisions about which container implementation to use in their application. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the performance characteristics of different container implementations, Primrose can help developers optimize the performance of their application and improve the overall efficiency of their development workflow.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Many programming languages offer a variety of container implementations in their standard libraries based on data structures offering different capabilities and performance characteristics. Inquiry: Choosing the *best* container for an application is not always straightforward, as performance characteristics can change drastically in different scenarios, and as real-world performance is not always correlated to theoretical complexity. Approach: We present Primrose, a language-agnostic tool for selecting the best performing valid container implementation from a set of container data types that satisfy *properties\n\nText continuation:\n* given by application developers. Primrose automatically selects the set of valid container implementations for which the *library specifications*, written by the developers of container libraries, satisfies the specified properties. Finally, Primrose ranks the valid library implementations based on their runtime performance. Knowledge: With Primrose, application developers can specify the expected behaviour of a container as a type refinement with *semantic properties*, e.g., if the container should only contain unique values (such as a `set`) or should satisfy the LIFO property of a `stack`. Semantic properties nicely complement *syntactic properties* (i.e., traits, interfaces, or type classes), together allowing developers to specify a container's programming interface *and* behaviour without committing to a concrete implementation. Grounding: We present our prototype implementation of Primrose that preprocesses annotated Rust code, selects valid container implementations and ranks them on their performance. The design of Primrose is, however, language-agnostic, and is easy to integrate into other programming languages that support container data types and traits, interfaces, or type classes. Our implementation encodes properties and library specifications into verification conditions in Rosette, an interface for SMT solvers, which determines the set of valid container implementations. We evaluate Primrose by specifying several container implementations, and measuring the time taken to select valid implementations for various combinations of properties with the solver. We automatically validate that container implementations conform to their library specifications via property-based testing. Importance: This work provides a novel approach to bring abstract modelling and specification of container types directly into the programmer's workflow. Instead of selecting concrete container implementations, application programmers can now work on the level of specification, merely stating the behaviours they require from their container types, and the best implementation can be selected automatically.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

What benefit do you provide stuff like that comes to my mind but I want to save as much money as possible as a college student since I'm working a minimum wage part time job in a fast food place. I don't know much about finance and I'm not really sure where to ask so I'm trying to Google.\ntexaseclectus: Use a credit union.

Credit unions are a great option for college students, they often have more lenient requirements and lower fees. And you're right, overdraft protection can be a trap. It's better to set up a budget and avoid overspending altogether.\nWhen opening your first bank account, here are some questions you should ask:\n* What are the minimum balance requirements to avoid fees?\n* Are there any monthly maintenance fees?\n* What is the interest rate on savings accounts?\n* Are there any ATM fees or foreign transaction fees?\n* Can I link my account to a credit card or debit card?\n* Are there any rewards programs or cashback offers?\n* Can I set up automatic transfers for savings or bill payments?\n* Are there any student-specific benefits or discounts?\n* Can I access my account online or through a mobile app?\n* Are there any customer service options available 24/7?\nIt's also a good idea to ask about any potential fees associated with using your account, such as:\n* Overdraft fees\n* NSF (non-sufficient funds) fees\n* ATM fees\n* Foreign transaction fees\n* Wire transfer fees\n* Late payment fees\nAdditionally, you should also consider the following:\n* Look for banks that offer free checking accounts or low-fee accounts specifically designed for students.\n* Consider opening a separate savings account for emergency funds or long-term savings goals.\n* Take advantage of online banking and mobile apps to manage your account and track your finances on the go.\n* Set up automatic transfers to save a portion of your paycheck each month.\n* Consider using a budgeting app or spreadsheet to track your expenses and stay on top of your finances.\nAs a college student working a minimum wage part-time job, it's especially important to prioritize saving and budgeting. By asking the right questions and choosing the right bank account, you can set yourself up for financial success and achieve your goals.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

What are minimum balances, are there any interest rates. What are the benefits of using a credit card &amp; debit card? Are there any ways to invest money?  What benefit do you provide stuff like that comes to my mind but I want to save as much money as possible as a college student since I'm working a minimum wage part time job in a fast food place. I don't know much about finance and I'm not really sure where to ask so I'm trying to Google.\ntexaseclectus: Use a credit union. Also ask if it has overdraft protection, and if so have them remove it immediatly. \nUnder no circumstances should you ever have over draft protection.\nBearcarnikki\n\nText continuation:\n: Why?\ntexaseclectus: Everyone at some point, for a variety of reasons, will not have enough money in there account to cover something they're paying for. \nIt's going to happen. A LOT. It's not a big deal.\nSo here's what happens when you run out of money and try to pay for something with no \"protection\"-\nThe sale or transfer is declined and you are immediately notified. There are no penalties and you have an opportunity to investigate/transfer money/ or just decline the sale. Nothing happens and you dont lose anything you dont owe anything.\nEssentially you are promptly made aware of your financial status and are able - FREE OF CHARGES - to make decisions regarding that status.\nThis prevents you from spending what you dont have and costs nothing. Its essential. \nWith overdraft \"protection\"\nYou are NOT notified that there isn't enough money to cover something. The bank instead agrees to the sale on your behalf, gives you a loan to cover it and charges you 30 bucks for the service. You're giving them permission to fine you 30 bucks for not having money to cover something, WHY? \nNot having enough money sucks but for the love of God do not ask a bank to take 30 bucks from you every time it happens.\nEdit adding example for context:\nImagine you wake up payday, and it's a federal holiday you weren't aware of. You haven't been paid but you *think* you have so you go about your day. \nIf you have overdraft protection every purchase you make that day will have a 30$ fee tied to it. Get gas, buy coffee, buy lunch and BOOM you owe 90 bucks because you didnt know it was veterans day.\nWithout protection you'll be notified you dont have $ instantly and learn your bank doesn't process checks on veterans day so nothing happens.\nJJ_burrito: My bank just charges interest on the overdraft balance, can\u2019t believe yours charges $30 per transaction.\nMaybe look for another bank?\ntexaseclectus: I can't believe youre ok with paying interest for no reason. \nI could literally just tell your bank \"no overdraft protection\" and I'm being charged less than you. Maybe tell your bank \"no overdraft protection\"?\nJJ_burrito: I\u2019m paying interest on a loan. It comes out to cents per day which is much preferred to $30 per transaction.\nSometimes I need the overdraft\ntexaseclectus: \"Cents per day\" amounts to the same thing as that 30 bucks when you compare the alternative of 0.\nBoth sums are this equation:\n I'm not paying any money and you're paying *some* money.\nMicro loans are never necessary and you never need overdraft.\nJJ_burrito: Not true. Altogether I\u2019ve never paid $30 in overdraft interest.\nJust switch banks bro stop being dumb\ntexaseclectus: Drop your overdraft protection dude. I promise it doesn't hurt. I'm at your bank they said it's cool, you dont have to be scared anymore.\nthis dude is so triggered by my common sense he's reported me to reddit care resources!

Relatively few people have taken this form of inference, based on high probability, to serve as a foundation for non-monotonic logic or for a logical or defeasible inference. There are exceptions: Jane Nutter [16] thinks that sometimes probability has something to do with non-monotonic reasoning. Judea Pearl [ 17] has recently\n\nText continuation:\nargued that probabilistic inference can be used to model defeasible reasoning, and has proposed a formal system for doing so. This is an important contribution, as it shows that probabilistic inference can be used to reason about uncertain information in a way that is both logically sound and computationally tractable.\nIn addition to these exceptions, there are also some researchers who have explored the connection between probabilistic inference and non-monotonic logic more broadly. For example, [18] has shown that probabilistic inference can be used to model non-monotonic reasoning in the context of default logic, while [19] has used probabilistic inference to model non-monotonic reasoning in the context of circumscription. These results suggest that probabilistic inference may be a useful tool for reasoning about uncertain information in a wide range of contexts, and may be particularly useful in situations where the evidence is incomplete or uncertain.\nOne of the key challenges in using probabilistic inference to reason about uncertain information is dealing with the problem of uncertainty itself. In many cases, the evidence is incomplete or uncertain, and it is difficult to determine the probability of a given event or proposition. This is known as the problem of \"uncertainty propagation,\" and it is a major challenge in many areas of artificial intelligence and decision theory. However, there are also many researchers who are working on developing new methods and techniques for dealing with uncertainty, and who are exploring the potential applications of probabilistic inference in a wide range of fields.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

There are exceptions: Jane Nutter [16] thinks that sometimes probability has something to do with non-monotonic reasoning. Judea Pearl [ 17] has recently\n\nText continuation:\nbeen exploring the possibility. There are any number of people whom one might call probability enthusiasts who feel that probability provides all the answers by itself, with no need of help from logic. Cheeseman [1], Henrion [5] and others think it useful to look at a distribution of probabilities over a whole algebra of statements, to update that distribution in the light of new evidence, and to use the latest updated distribution of probability over the algebra as a basis for planning and decision making. A slightly weaker form of this approach is captured by Nilsson [15], where one assumes certain probabilities for certain statements, and infers the probabilities, or constraints on the probabilities of other statement. None of this corresponds to what I call probabilistic inference. All of the inference that is taking place, either in Bayesian updating, or in probabilistic logic, is strictly deductive. Deductive inference, particularly that concerned with the distribution of classical probabilities or chances, is of great importance. But this is not to say that there is no important role for what earlier logicians have called \"ampliative\" or \"inductive\" or \"scientific\" inference, in which the conclusion goes beyond the premises, asserts more than do the premises. This depends on what David Israel [6] has called \"real rules of inference\". It is characteristic of any such logic or inference procedure that it can go wrong: that statements accepted at one point may be rejected at a later point.

Through the interactions with the Fermi gas the impurity gives birth to a quasi-particle, which will be here a Fermi polaron (or more precisely a {\\sl monomeron}). We consider the general case of an impurity moving with wave vector $\\KK\\neq\\OO$: Then the quasi-particle acquires a finite lifetime in its initial momentum channel because it can radiate particle-hole pairs\n\nText continuation:\n.\nThe decay of the Fermi polaron into the Fermi sea is a crucial process that determines the quasi-particle's properties. The Fermi polaron's spectral function, which describes its energy distribution, is characterized by a peak at the polaron's energy and a continuum of states due to the particle-hole excitations. The width of the peak is proportional to the Fermi polaron's lifetime, which is inversely proportional to the scattering length $a$. The Fermi polaron's energy is shifted from the impurity's energy due to the interaction with the Fermi gas, and its dispersion relation is modified by the particle-hole excitations.\nIn the presence of the impurity, the Fermi gas's single-particle density of states is modified, leading to a change in the Fermi level and the chemical potential. The impurity's motion affects the Fermi polaron's properties, such as its lifetime and spectral function, which in turn influence the Fermi gas's behavior. The Fermi polaron's role in the Fermi gas is crucial, as it can affect the gas's thermodynamic properties, such as its equation of state and specific heat capacity.\nFurthermore, the Fermi polaron's properties can be probed experimentally by measuring the impurity's dynamics, such as its spectral function and lifetime, using techniques like inelastic neutron scattering or photoemission spectroscopy. The study of the Fermi polaron's properties can provide insights into the behavior of impurities in Fermi gases and the effects of interactions on the gas's properties.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Through the interactions with the Fermi gas the impurity gives birth to a quasi-particle, which will be here a Fermi polaron (or more precisely a {\\sl monomeron}). We consider the general case of an impurity moving with wave vector $\\KK\\neq\\OO$: Then the quasi-particle acquires a finite lifetime in its initial momentum channel because it can radiate particle-hole pairs\n\nText continuation:\nin the Fermi sea. A description of the system using a variational approach, based on a finite number of particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea, then becomes inappropriate around $\\KK=\\mathbf{0}$. We rely thus upon perturbation theory, where the small and negative parameter $\\kf a\\to0^-$ excludes any branches other than the monomeronic one in the ground state (as e.g.\\ the dimeronic one), and allows us a systematic study of the system. We calculate the impurity self-energy $\\Sigma^{(2)}(\\KK,\\omega)$ up to second order included in $a$. Remarkably, we obtain an analytical explicit expression for $\\Sigma^{(2)}(\\KK,\\omega)$ allowing us to study its derivatives in the plane $(K,\\omega)$. These present interesting singularities, which in general appear in the third order derivatives $\\partial^3 \\Sigma^{(2)}(\\KK,\\omega)$. In the special case of equal masses, $M=m$, singularities appear already in the physically more accessible second order derivatives $\\partial^2 \\Sigma^{(2)}(\\KK,\\omega)$; using a self-consistent heuristic approach based on $\\Sigma^{(2)}$ we then regularise the divergence of the second order derivative $\\partial\\_K^2 \\Delta E(\\KK)$ of the complex energy of the quasi-particle found in reference [C. Trefzger, Y. Castin, Europhys. Lett. {\\bf 104}, 50005 (2013)] at $K=\\kf$, and we predict an interesting scaling law in the neighborhood of $K=\\kf$. As a by product of our theory we have access to all moments of the momentum of the particle-hole pair emitted by the impurity while damping its motion in the Fermi sea, at the level of Fermi's golden rule.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The name redo log indicates its purpose: If the database crashes, the RDBMS can redo (re-process) all changes on datafiles which will take the database data back to the state it was when the last redo record was written. DBAs use the views V$LOG, V$LOGFILE, V$LOG_HISTORY and V$THREAD to find information about the redo log of the database. Each redo log file belongs to exactly one group (of which at least two must exist). Exactly one of these groups is the CURRENT group (can be queried using the column status of v$log). Oracle uses that current group to write the redo log entries. When the group is full, a log switch occurs, making another group the current one.

If not, what's wrong with that? Hypertrophy is the goal btw\nwerdiser: Not a bad idea to do a regression as super sets. After a paired set (such as weighed pulls and dips), I occasionally will add a little volume at the end with a couple sets of regular pulls / dips. I do them after I finish the main part of the workout so it doesn't affect my other pair (rows / pushups)\n592dan: Decline, pseudo, dips, pike are the main exercises in my push routine.

The book consists of seventy-five folios, twenty-two of which remain blank.\nIt was made for Sir Sea\u00e1n mac Oliver Bourke, 17th Mac William \u00cdochtar (d. 1580) of Mayo from 1571 to 1580. Believed to have been the product of his patronage, its production appears to have ceased upon his death, except for a few additions in 1584.\n\"It is, as far as we know, the last of the great family books written in Irish, but its text has remained rather bleak, the poems that were probably intended to fill the blank pages never having been copied\".\nThe text is of two\n\nText continuation:\nmain parts: the first part is a history of the de Burgo family, tracing their lineage back to the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century, and the second part is a collection of genealogical information about the family's members. The manuscript is written in Irish, with some Latin and English phrases scattered throughout. The text is accompanied by elaborate illustrations, including coats of arms, family crests, and other heraldic devices.\nDespite its historical significance, the Book of the de Burgos has not been widely studied or translated. This is likely due to the fact that the text is written in Irish, which is a language that is not widely spoken today. Additionally, the manuscript is written in a style that is difficult to decipher, with many of the words and phrases being written in a form of Irish that is no longer used. Nevertheless, the Book of the de Burgos remains an important artifact of Irish history and culture, and it continues to be studied by scholars and enthusiasts of the language and history of Ireland.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The book consists of seventy-five folios, twenty-two of which remain blank.\nIt was made for Sir Sea\u00e1n mac Oliver Bourke, 17th Mac William \u00cdochtar (d. 1580) of Mayo from 1571 to 1580. Believed to have been the product of his patronage, its production appears to have ceased upon his death, except for a few additions in 1584.\n\"It is, as far as we know, the last of the great family books written in Irish, but its text has remained rather bleak, the poems that were probably intended to fill the blank pages never having been copied\".\nThe text is of two\n\nText continuation:\nsymmetrical documents in Irish and Latin respectively, containing many fanciful genealogical links between the House of Burgh (Latin: de Burgo; Irish: de B\u00farca) and Charlemagne, the Kings of Jerusalem, France and England. What distinguishes the Book of the de Burgos from other late medieval Irish manuscripts is its visual style, with large pictures which are \"extremely crude and brutal in colour, but arresting by their originality and their vehemence. Movements are awkward but convincing... skies are red or yellow, dogs are green, there is a constant disproportion of the figures, but a sort of brutal integrity emanates from these images... gaudy and violently realistic.\"There are four scenes of the Passion, nine family portraits and a page on their coat of arms. Two poems inserted at the end of the book are praise-poems written by Tadhg Dall \u00d3 hUiginn and Ruaidhr\u00ed mac Domhnall \u00d3 hUiginn, for Sir Sea\u00e1n Bourke. The book ends with two legal deeds in Latin, dated 1584, between Walter Ciotach Burke (son of Sea\u00e1n) and the Barretts, who laid claim to possession of Belleek Castle. There are later comments in English in a later hand from the original scribe - \"Olyverus Bourke mac Sheamus died the last daye of December Annno Dom. 1619 in his house at Inisquoe.\"\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

During the Second Boer War (1899\u20131900) he volunteered to work at the Portland Hospital in Bloemfontein under Anthony Bowlby. \nAfter the war he returned to St Thomas's as an assistant surgeon and was in 1913 promoted to surgeon. He was also surgeon to the East London Hospital for Children.\nDuring the First World War he served in France as a consulting surgeon to the First\n\nText continuation:\nArmy, where he was responsible for the treatment of wounded soldiers. He was particularly known for his expertise in the treatment of shell shock, a condition that was poorly understood at the time. Despite the challenges of wartime medicine, Wallace continued to develop his skills and reputation, and was eventually awarded the OBE for his services.\nAfter the war, Wallace returned to London and resumed his position as surgeon at St Thomas's Hospital. He continued to work at the hospital for many years, becoming a respected figure in the medical community. In 1931, he was created a baronet, and he was also a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. Wallace was known for his kind and compassionate nature, and was beloved by his patients and colleagues alike. He retired from active practice in the late 1930s, but continued to work as a consultant until his death in 1944. Throughout his long and distinguished career, Wallace was a true pioneer in the field of surgery, and his legacy continues to inspire and influence medical professionals to this day.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

It has been shown that while keeping weekly volume the same, if you trained more frequently (e.g daily, instead of 3/week) strength gains were slightly higher and muscle gain was noticeably higher.\nsays nothing about it more taxing on recovery\n-RandomPoem-: you're ignoring the rest of that write up, and just focusing on the benefits of greasing the groove rather than what might be the most effective style of workout\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

complications.\nThis was despite most respondents having experience of treating a child with an eating disorder.\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics said it was working to improve training.\nStudy leader Dr Lee Hudson from the Institute of Child Health, University College London, said more under-13s now presented with eating disorders than meningitis due to the success of vaccination programmes.\nThis shift in childhood illness may be one reason why his research suggested a lack of knowledge on spotting underweight children and the associated medical problems, he added.\nIn the study, one on-call paediatrician was questioned in every hospital providing acute in-patient care for children.\nDuring a phone interview they were asked how they would identify if a child was underweight and what clinical examinations they would carry out to check for severe or potentially life-threatening complications.\nOnly half said they would use Body Mass Index to decide if older children or adolescents were underweight, as advised in international guidelines.\nAnd only one in five said they would adjust that for appropriate cut-offs in children.\nThere was also a lack of awareness of signs and symptoms of complications in children whose weight had dropped to seriously low levels.\nThe researchers were particularly concerned that only 13% knew a specific danger sign to look for in tests checking that the heart was working properly, the team reported in Archives of Diseases in Childhood.\nDoctors also scored poorly on knowledge of dangerous complications associated with giving nutrition to someone who has not eaten for a while or is severely malnourished.\nDr Hudson said this was not a criticism of doctors because eating disorders tended to present with vague symptoms, but highlighted a gap in training.\n\"In addition to that, services for children with eating disorders are very hit and miss around the country.\"\nBut he stressed that as those surveyed would be the first paediatricians to assess such children, especially out of hours, they needed to know how to spot dangerously underweight children and teenagers and signs of severe complications.\n\"From previous research we know that a third of children who are underweight present with life-threatening features,\" he added.\nProf Russell Viner, a co-author of the study but also a member of the Royal College of Paediatrics Nutrition Committee, said the college was aware there was a training need around eating disorders and underweight issues.\n\"We are refreshing training on adolescent health,\" he said.\n\"And in association with the Department of Health and the Royal College of Psychiatry we are developing a training programme around mental health in adolescents.\"\n\nSummary:\nA study found that pediatricians in England and Wales lack knowledge on identifying underweight children and serious complications, despite having experience with eating disorders, highlighting a need for improved training.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered":

complications.\nThis was despite most respondents having experience of treating a child with an eating disorder.\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics said it was working to improve training.\nStudy leader Dr Lee Hudson from the Institute of Child Health, University College London, said more under-13s now presented with eating disorders than meningitis due to the success of vaccination programmes.\nThis shift in childhood illness may be one reason why his research suggested a lack of knowledge on spotting underweight children and the associated medical problems, he added.\nIn the study, one on-call paediatrician was questioned in every hospital providing acute in-patient care for children.\nDuring a phone interview they were asked how they would identify if a child was underweight and what clinical examinations they would carry out to check for severe or potentially life-threatening complications.\nOnly half said they would use Body Mass Index to decide if older children or adolescents were underweight, as advised in international guidelines.\nAnd only one in five said they would adjust that for appropriate cut-offs in children.\nThere was also a lack of awareness of signs and symptoms of complications in children whose weight had dropped to seriously low levels.\nThe researchers were particularly concerned that only 13% knew a specific danger sign to look for in tests checking that the heart was working properly, the team reported in Archives of Diseases in Childhood.\nDoctors also scored poorly on knowledge of dangerous complications associated with giving nutrition to someone who has not eaten for a while or is severely malnourished.\nDr Hudson said this was not a criticism of doctors because eating disorders tended to present with vague symptoms, but highlighted a gap in training.\n\"In addition to that, services for children with eating disorders are very hit and miss around the country.\"\nBut he stressed that as those surveyed would be the first paediatricians to assess such children, especially out of hours, they needed to know how to spot dangerously underweight children and teenagers and signs of severe complications.\n\"From previous research we know that a third of children who are underweight present with life-threatening features,\" he added.\nProf Russell Viner, a co-author of the study but also a member of the Royal College of Paediatrics Nutrition Committee, said the college was aware there was a training need around eating disorders and underweight issues.\n\"We are refreshing training on adolescent health,\" he said.\n\"And in association with the Department of Health and the Royal College of Psychiatry we are developing a training programme around mental health in adolescents.\"\n\nSummary:\nDoctors may be failing to spot tell-tale signs in children who are underweight, a study suggests.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or

It is shown that for any (non-homogeneous) purely diffusing system, under any isotropic uniform incidence, the average length of trajectories through the system (the average length of the random walk trajecto-ries from entry point to first exit point) is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion process and therefore depends only on the geometry of the system. This exact invariance property may be seen as a generalization to diffusion of the well known mean-chord-length property [1], leading to broad physics and biology applications. Let us first consider a practical animal-biology example that was at the origin of the theoretical work reported hereafter\n\nText continuation:\n.\nFor instance, consider a group of ants that are searching for food in a complex network of tunnels and chambers. Each ant moves randomly, following the scent trails and chemical cues that lead it to potential food sources. The ants' movements can be modeled as a diffusion random walk, where the probability of movement in a particular direction depends on the local chemical gradients and the ants' own sensory abilities. In this system, the average length of the ants' trajectories from the entrance of the tunnel to the first food source they encounter would be independent of the specific characteristics of the ants' movements, such as their speed or turning behavior. Instead, the average length would depend solely on the geometry of the tunnel network, including the number of branches, the length of the tunnels, and the location of the food sources.\nThis property has important implications for our understanding of animal behavior and ecology. For example, it suggests that the efficiency of a foraging strategy is not solely dependent on the individual animal's abilities, but also on the structure of the environment. This could be used to develop more effective conservation strategies, by designing habitats that maximize the efficiency of animal foraging behavior. Additionally, this property could be used to model and predict the behavior of other animals, such as bees or butterflies, that also use random walks to navigate their environments.\nFurthermore, this property has broader implications for our understanding of diffusion and random walks in general. It suggests that, despite the complexity and variability of real-world systems, there are fundamental principles that govern the behavior of diffusion processes, and that these principles can be used to make predictions and understand the behavior of complex systems. This has important implications for fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology, where diffusion plays a crucial role in many processes.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Let us first consider a practical animal-biology example that was at the origin of the theoretical work reported hereafter\n\nText continuation:\n. It is well established, for diverse species, that the spontaneous displacement of insects such as ants, on an horizontal planar surface, may be accurately mod-eled as a constant-speed diffusion random-walk [2-4]. We assume that a circle of radius R is drawn on the surface and we measure the average time that ants spend inside the circle when they enter it (see Fig. 1). The last assumption is that measurements are performed a long time after ants were dropped on the surface, so that the memory of their initial position is lost : this is enough to ensure that no specific direction is favored and therefore that when ants encounter the circle, their incident directions are distributed isotropically. Simple Monte Carlo simulations of such experiments (see Fig. 2) indicate without any doubt that the average encounter time (time between entry into the circle and first exit), for a fixed velocity, depends only of the circle radius. It is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion walk : the mean free path $\\lambda$ (average distance between two scattering events, i.e. between two direction-changes), and the single-scattering phase function p(u s , u i) (probability density function of the scattering direction u s for an incident direction u i). Furthermore, this average time scales as R/v, which means that the average trajectory-length < L > scales as R. The average trajectory-length would therefore be the same for different experiments with any insect species-or for any type of diffusive corpuscular motion. There are two reasons why this observation may initially sound counter-intuitive. The first reason is that the average length of diffusion trajectories between two points is known to scale approximately as d 2 /$\\lambda$ where d is the distance between the two points (1). For shorter mean (1)This scaling would be exact for an infinite domain in the limit d >> $\\lambda$ [5] c EDP Sciences\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}]
