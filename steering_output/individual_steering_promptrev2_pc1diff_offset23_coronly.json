He previously served as the 26th Prime Minister of Turkey from 1983 to 1989 as the leader of the Motherland Party. He was the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey in the military government of B\u00fclend Ulusu between 1980 and 1982.\nAfter working briefly at the World Bank in the United States and as a university lecturer, \u00d6zal became the general secretary and later the leader of the main miners' trade union of Turkey in 1979, serving as a chief negotiator during large-scale industrial action in 1977. He unsuccessfully stood for Parliament in the 1977 general election as a National\n\nText continuation:\nSalvation Party candidate. \u00d6zal's experience in the trade union movement and his involvement in industrial action gave him a strong understanding of the working class and the struggles they faced, which would later influence his policies as Prime Minister and President.\n\u00d6zal's entry into politics was marked by his election as the leader of the Motherland Party in 1983, which was a newly formed party that aimed to challenge the dominant political parties in Turkey. As Prime Minister, \u00d6zal implemented a series of economic reforms aimed at liberalizing the Turkish economy and attracting foreign investment. He also pursued a policy of reconciliation with Greece, which had been a major foreign policy issue in Turkey for decades. \u00d6zal's government also implemented a number of social and cultural reforms, including the establishment of a new university system and the introduction of a new penal code.\nAs President, \u00d6zal continued to pursue his economic and social reforms, and also played a key role in the country's foreign policy. He was a strong supporter of Turkey's membership in the European Union and worked closely with European leaders to advance Turkey's bid for membership. \u00d6zal also played a key role in the country's relations with the Middle East, particularly with Iran and Iraq. He was a strong advocate for Turkish-Iranian cooperation and worked to strengthen the two countries' economic and cultural ties.\n\u00d6zal's legacy in Turkey is complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, he is remembered for his economic reforms, which helped to transform Turkey's economy and make it more competitive in the global market. He is also remembered for his efforts to promote social and cultural change, including the establishment of a new university system and the introduction of a new penal code. On the other hand, \u00d6zal's government was also marked by controversy and criticism, particularly with regards to his handling of the Kurdish issue and his relationship with the military. Despite these controversies, \u00d6zal remains one of the most important and influential figures in Turkish politics in the second half of the 20th century.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In 1979, he became an undersecretary to Prime Minister S\u00fcleyman Demirel's minority government until the 1980 military coup. As an undersecretary, he played a major role in developing economic reforms, known as the '24 January decisions,' which paved the way for greater neoliberalism in the Turkish economy. After the coup, he was appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey responsible for the economy in B\u00fclend Ulusu's government and continued to implement economic reforms. He resigned in 1982 following disagreements over economic policy.\u00d6zal formed the Motherland Party (ANAP) in 1983 after the ban on political parties was lifted by the military government. ANAP won a parliamentary majority in the 1983 general election and \u00d6zal subsequently became the Prime Minister of Turkey. While implementing several economic reforms concerning the exchange rate and deregulation, a rise in inflation and the growing conflict with Kurdish separatists led to ANAP winning reduced pluralities in the 1984 local elections. Despite a referendum in 1987 allowing politicians banned during the 1980 coup to resume political activities, ANAP was re-elected with a parliamentary majority in the 1987 general election, albeit with a reduced share of the vote. He survived an assassination attempt during a party congress in 1988. \u00d6zal's foreign policy focused on averting war with Greece following the \u015eim\u015fek Incident and temporarily allowed Bulgarian Turks to emigrate to Turkey.\n\u00d6zal was elected President of the Turkish Republic in the 1989 presidential election, while Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Akbulut replaced him as Prime Minister. Despite assuming a ceremonial role with minimal political duties, \u00d6zal remained occupied with government activities, such as intervening in the 1990 Zonguldak miners' strikes. While Akbulut took a docile approach as Prime Minister, disputes over the President's and Prime Minister's duties were dominant when S\u00fcleyman Demirel became Prime Minister after the 1991 general election. The Southeastern Anatolia development project began with the construction of the Atat\u00fcrk Dam in \u015eanl\u0131urfa, while \u00d6zal participated in the first ever summit of Turkic Republics in 1992 held in Ankara. He maintained close relations with the President of the United States George H. W. Bush during the Gulf War and the end of the Cold War. \u00d6zal died unexpectedly while in office in 1993, with an exhumation in 2012 leading to evidence of poisoning but the cause of death was unclear.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "H", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Josef Fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children. Investigators believe Fritzl planned to build the cellar as early as 1978, shortly after, according to his daughter, he began raping her at age 11 or 12, said police spokesman Franz Polzer. The 73-year-old Austrian began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year, and simply added the hidden space -- which was not recorded in any building plans -- Polzer said. It took Fritzl until 1983 to finish the addition, Polzer said. Investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison, which was blocked by a 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) steel and concrete door that Fritzl probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance, Polzer said. Fritzl, who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar, had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison. \"You would have to open up a total of eight doors, and ... (for the) last door which would go into this space (where the family was imprisoned), you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus,\" Polzer said. \"We will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we haven't discovered yet, and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting.\" Fritzl was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter, Elisabeth, captive in the dungeon under the Fritzl home for decades, repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children -- six of whom survived. Three of the children were adopted by Josef Fritzl and his wife after he concocted the ruse that Elisabeth had left the babies on their doorstep. The story of the family's imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago, when one of the children still in the dungeon, 19-year-old Kerstin Fritzl, fell seriously ill with convulsions. The father agreed to take her to a hospital, the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers. Dr. Albert Reiter, who is treating Kerstin, said Monday that while her condition is still \"grave,\" it \"has improved somewhat.\" \"She has become more stable, but despite that we have to continue to keep her under sedation and give her respiratory help,\" Reiter said, noting it is not clear how long she will be kept under sedation. Elisabeth and her two sons were reunited with her mother, Rosemarie, who police say knew nothing about the basement prison. They were also reunited with the three children that Josef had taken from Elisabeth. The reunited family is living in secluded quarters at a psychiatric clinic, where they are finding a daily routine and adjusting to sunlight -- something the two boys had never seen -- according to the clinic's chief doctor. \"The mother and the smallest child have, in just the last couple of days, increased their sensitivity to light,\" Dr. Berthold Kepplinger said. \"So we have been able to equip them with protective sunglasses.\" Five-year-old Felix is \"getting more and more lively,\" Kepplinger said. \"He's fascinated by everything that he sees around him -- the fresh air, the light, and the food -- all of these things are helping them,\" he said. \"Slowly the color of their skin is changing back to a more normal (shade).\" He also said the family members are still getting to know each other and live together as a family. Kepplinger praised Elisabeth for having provided a daily living routine for her children during their captivity. He said the family is getting into a new routine in which the mother and the grandmother make breakfast for the family, and the children make their beds. However, he said there is a noticeable difference between the pace of life of the children held in captivity and that of those who grew up in Fritzl's home. He said the mother, Elisabeth, takes breaks and naps several times a day. The health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying, Kepplinger said. Kepplinger said the children, after being confined to a small space their entire lives, are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces. Initially the dungeon where Fritzl held his daughter was only 35 square meters. In 1993, around the time Elisabeth was pregnant with her fourth child, Fritzl decided to add to the dungeon, building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters. On Wednesday or Thursday, prosecution authorities will attempt to question Fritzl -- who is no longer talking to police following his initial confession, state prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek said. A warden at the St. Poelten jail, where Fritzl is being held, told CNN that Fritzl appears to be doing well, but he is refusing to go on walks outside the building where he is detained.

I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\nUser 1: What's the proposal?\nUser 2: We can meet at 82 dollars, with the additional services and features I mentioned earlier.

He was a strong advocate for the separation of Church and State, and he believed that this principle was essential for protecting the rights and freedoms of all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof. Lipman was also a passionate advocate for social justice and equality, and he worked tirelessly to promote these values through his work with various organizations and community groups.\nIn addition to his work as an attorney and activist, Lipman was also a prolific writer and speaker. He wrote numerous articles and essays on topics related to Humanism, Church/State separation, and social justice, and he was a frequent guest speaker at conferences and events around the country.

Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, decided to advance into Germany on a broad front in 1944, against the suggestions of his principal subordinates, Lieutenant Generals Omar Bradley and George S. Patton and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, who argued instead to stage competing advances on narrow fronts. The decision was controversial initially because the British government wanted to raise the profile of the minority British contingent in what was by then an overwhelmingly American army, and they perceived that a British-led thrust to Berlin would achieve this aim. Montgomery's strident advocacy raised political and nationalistic complications that strained the wartime alliance. During the\n\nText continuation:\nwar, the British had always maintained a strong sense of national pride and identity, and the prospect of an American-led invasion of Germany threatened to diminish their role in the conflict. Montgomery, as the most senior British officer, was determined to ensure that the British contingent played a significant part in the final push into Germany.\nDespite the controversy, Eisenhower remained committed to his broad front strategy, which he believed would allow for a faster and more decisive victory. He was also concerned about the potential risks of a narrow front approach, which could have led to a prolonged and bloody battle for every inch of ground. The British government, however, continued to press for a more prominent role for their forces, and Montgomery remained a vocal advocate for a British-led thrust to Berlin.\nAs the war drew to a close, the controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy continued to simmer. Montgomery's advocacy had created tensions within the Allied command, and some American officers felt that he was being overly critical of Eisenhower's decision. Meanwhile, the British government remained committed to its goal of ensuring a prominent role for British forces in the final stages of the war.\nIn the end, the controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy did not significantly impact the outcome of the war. The Allies ultimately achieved a decisive victory over Germany, and the British contingent played a significant part in the final push into Germany. However, the controversy did highlight the complex and sometimes contentious nature of the Allied command during World War II. It also underscored the importance of national pride and identity in the war effort, and the ways in which these factors could sometimes create tensions and conflicts within the Allied alliance.\nThe controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy also highlights the challenges faced by military leaders during times of war. Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, and Montgomery were all highly experienced and respected military leaders, but they still had to make difficult decisions under pressure. The controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy was just one of many challenges that they faced during the war, and it is a testament to their leadership and strategic vision that they were able to overcome these challenges and ultimately achieve victory.\nIn the years that followed the war, the controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy was largely forgotten, and the focus turned to the reconstruction of Europe and the rebuilding of the Allied nations. However, the controversy remains an important reminder of the complexities and challenges of military leadership, and the ways in which national pride and identity can sometimes create tensions and conflicts within the military alliance. It is a testament to the enduring legacy of World War II, and the ways in which it continues to shape our understanding of war and military leadership to this day.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, decided to advance into Germany on a broad front in 1944, against the suggestions of his principal subordinates, Lieutenant Generals Omar Bradley and George S. Patton and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, who argued instead to stage competing advances on narrow fronts. The decision was controversial initially because the British government wanted to raise the profile of the minority British contingent in what was by then an overwhelmingly American army, and they perceived that a British-led thrust to Berlin would achieve this aim. Montgomery's strident advocacy raised political and nationalistic complications that strained the wartime alliance. During the\n\nText continuation:\nsubsequent Cold War, suggestions were made that the Soviet presence in Eastern Europe may have been reduced had Eisenhower sent a narrow-front thrust to race the USSR to Berlin in 1945.\nEisenhower's decision was based on both political and military factors. There were serious reservations in the autumn of 1944 about whether the Allied logistical system could support the narrow-front strategy, because at that time there were insufficient working ports to support large formations far from the coast, the road and rail transport network was already under severe strain, and there were concerns about being able to protect the narrow supply lines deep into enemy territory, through terrain that included crossing many rivers, in weather which hampered air support. In addition the Allied occupation zones in Germany had been agreed upon in February 1944, and a faster Allied advance in the autumn of 1944 would not have altered this. The Soviet Union would have also benefited from a rapid German collapse, and its participation in the war against Japan was greatly desired. The staff at Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) considered Montgomery's proposed advance on the Ruhr and Berlin and Bradley's proposed advance on Metz and the Saar, and assessed both to be feasible, but only on the assumptions that the port of Antwerp was brought rapidly into service, that considerable additional air, rail and road transportation became available, and that the other Allied armies were already poised on the German border. These assumptions were not met until very late in the year, by which time circumstances had changed. The consequences if the narrow front advance had failed, would have been severe.\nThe British historian A. J. P. Taylor credited Chester Wilmot's The Struggle For Europe (1952) as the work that \"launched the myths that Eisenhower prevented Montgomery from winning the war in 1944\". Few historians on either side of the Atlantic accept ending the war in 1944 was possible. \"Wilmot's book\", American historian Maurice Matloff wrote, \"must be taken for what it represents\u2014a suggestive, provocative work on the war written from a British point of view in a period of disenchantment.\" Montgomery's Chief of Staff, Major-General Freddie de Guingand, stated in his post-war account that he had opposed Montgomery's narrow front strategy on political and administrative grounds, but Montgomery's wartime Chief Administrative Officer, Major-General Miles Graham defended his contention that the narrow front advance was logistically feasible.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Last week, I think the election coverage just sapped any motivation I had left. It's been a really rough time lately. I've been unemployed for over a month and getting lots of interviews but no offers yet. Things with the girlfriend have been bad and it's really hurt my outlook. Money is tight and up until Saturday my roommate and I had been unsuccessfully looking for a new tenant. Well now the election is decided, we have a new roommate, I had two promising interviews today and several scheduled for this week, and my girlfriend and I are gonna try to heal things tonight. So I forced myself to go outside and do some shit, although I admit it wasn't fucking easy to take that first\n\nText continuation:\nstep.\nI walked out the door, feeling the crisp autumn air hit my face, and immediately regretted not wearing a jacket. The sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the neighborhood, but I barely noticed. My mind was elsewhere, replaying all the negative thoughts and worries that had been plaguing me for weeks. I had to shake them off, though. I had to focus on the present moment and what I could control.\nAs I started my warm-up, my legs felt like lead and my lungs burned from lack of use. It was like my body was screaming at me to stop, to give up and go back to the comfort of my couch. But I pushed through the discomfort, gradually increasing my pace and intensity. The sweat started dripping down my face, and my muscles began to ache, but I kept going.\nThe first few reps of my workout were a struggle, but as I got into a rhythm, I started to feel a sense of accomplishment. I was doing it. I was taking control of my life, one rep at a time. The stress and anxiety that had been weighing me down started to lift, replaced by a sense of empowerment.\nAs I finished my workout and walked back into my apartment, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had faced my demons and come out on top. I knew that tomorrow would bring new challenges, but I was ready. I was ready to tackle whatever life threw my way, one rep at a time.\nAnd as I sat down to write this, I realized that maybe, just maybe, this little workout was more than just a physical exercise. Maybe it was a metaphor for life. Maybe it was a reminder that no matter how tough things get, we always have the power to take control, to push through the pain and come out stronger on the other side.\nI know that I still have a long way to go. I still have to face the uncertainty of my job search and the challenges of my relationship. But for now, I'm taking things one rep at a time. I'm taking control of my life, one workout at a time. And who knows, maybe someday I'll look back on this tough time and realize that it was the catalyst for something greater. Maybe someday I'll look back and say, \"You know what? That was the best thing that ever happened to me.\"\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

So I forced myself to go outside and do some shit, although I admit it wasn't fucking easy to take that first\n\nText continuation:\nstep. \n&amp;#x200B;\nI started by doing a bridge hold and trying to push my stomach as high in the air as possible. I'm not particularly flexible and my bridge kind of sucks, so I think it's important to keep stretching those muscles to get that synovial fluid in there. Followed up with a few L-Holds, and I was surprised to discover that I can actually hold my legs out almost straight with my butt almost completely off the ground for a couple seconds before collapsing. Couldn't even get my butt off the ground at all a few months ago. I rounded out the stretches with some twist holds and amazingly I can actually lock my hands behind my back on my right side. Left side is still pretty tight but I'm seeing slow progress with a hand towel. \n&amp;#x200B;\nOn to pushups. I started with just a few conventional pushups to get the blood circulating, and then a few close pushups. I migrated to one of the beer die tables in the backyard and did a few one-arm incline pushups with legs apart at first, then together. Legs together is so much fucking harder it's not even funny, even with such a steep incline. I can feel my feet slipping from underneath me. I'm trying so hard to not rotate my torso when coming back up, and I'm trying to avoid splaying my elbows. Left arm is having a hell of a time keeping up with the right. I transitioned to the ground for some slow and steady close pushups. I've stopped counting and recording reps like I used to, I just go until it hurts but before failure. \n&amp;#x200B;\nNext were leg raises. Started out on the ground with straight legs, and the next set I moved to the bar. Hanging leg raises are a lot harder for me because I feel more of a strain in my quads, and I tend to swing a little. I tried keeping my core flexed and tight the whole time to avoid swinging, but at this point I feel like I can get my muscles burning more on my back because my stamina is so much less while hanging. \n&amp;#x200B;\nFinally, grip training. Started with some clenched eagle claws, then 2 sets of 5 fingertip pushups to work the tops of the fingers. I did a few hangs from the bar to warm up, and then started some towel hangs. Jesus, is my endurance lower with the towel, and it's not even a thick one. But if I can get up to 30 seconds with the towel I'll be pretty happy with that, as I can do about a minute on the bar. \n&amp;#x200B;\nThat was it for the day. I went in, made my 1 giant meal for the day, started my fasting timer, and I'll try to hop on the stationary bike later tonight. Just thought I'd share this momentous day of getting off my ass and doing the right thing for a change. I'll keep going this whole week and stop being a lazy fuck. Thank you to this sub for keeping me mostly motivated throughout these many months. Cheers.\n5sav1age9: A week off can actually be really good for you and just what you need.

Can I still connect? Pics attached.\nso there are 3 wires coming from the wall.  One is a fat black one, and fat white one the other is ground.  The dishwasher also has the black and white but they're much thinner and frayed.  I was concerned that maybe the power coming from the house is too high in watts, or however its measured.  No idea how I would know. Its a 40 yr old house and the dishwasher is at least 30 yrs old, maybe more. Am I good to just connect them?  Or does rewiring need to take place?\nhttp://i.imgur.com/f29JO5h.jpg, this is the black one coming from the wall\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rUEnn9R.jpg this is the one from the dishwasher\nI don't recall if the wires from the old dishwasher\n\nText continuation:\nwere replaced or not. My parents didn't mention it, and I'm not sure if they'd even know. The house was built in the 70s, and I'm guessing the wiring is probably original. The dishwasher is at least 30 years old, and I'm not sure if it's been replaced or upgraded since then.\nI'm a bit concerned about the frayed wires, as they seem to be a bit worn out. I'm not an electrician, but I've heard that frayed wires can be a fire hazard. Should I be worried about this? Is it safe to connect the new dishwasher to the old wiring, or should I consider hiring a professional to take a look?\nI've also noticed that the wires from the wall are quite fat, while the ones from the dishwasher are thinner. Is this normal? Should I be concerned about the difference in size? I've heard that thicker wires can handle more power, but I'm not sure if this applies to the situation.\nI've attached some pictures of the wires for reference. The first one is the fat black wire coming from the wall, and the second one is the thinner black wire from the dishwasher.

Can I still connect? Pics attached.\nso there are 3 wires coming from the wall.  One is a fat black one, and fat white one the other is ground.  The dishwasher also has the black and white but they're much thinner and frayed.  I was concerned that maybe the power coming from the house is too high in watts, or however its measured.  No idea how I would know. Its a 40 yr old house and the dishwasher is at least 30 yrs old, maybe more. Am I good to just connect them?  Or does rewiring need to take place?\nhttp://i.imgur.com/f29JO5h.jpg, this is the black one coming from the wall\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rUEnn9R.jpg this is the one from the dishwasher\nI don't recall if the wires from the old dishwasher\n\nText continuation:\nwere similar, sorry.\nI'll be turning off the power from the circuit breaker incase anyone was going to mention I do that first.  \nHopefully I can get this done for them tonite.  \ndfoley1313: What do you mean you have wires coming from the wall? The new dishwasher should have came with a new cord or you need to get one. Usually the dishwasher plugs into the same outlet as the garbage disposal would but one outlet is controlled by a switch meaning one outlet is always hot while the other is controlled by the switch. If there is only 1 hot coming do not worry about power or is still at 120ac \nbrock_lee: Where do you live?  In most of America the dishwasher is hard-wired and never comes with a plug-in cord. In fact, it is usually on a dedicated circuit which is code.\nghostfacr: This is correct and proper.  There is a junction box at the bottom front of like, every dishwasher.\ndfoley1313: That isn't code. Code is having a GFCI with dedicated circuit. You can use a pig tail to connect to the outlet under the sink, but yes you can connect hardwired. But again why do that, it is not a code issue and it is more of a pain in the ass to do so. Also Norther Cali \ngottapoop: Code in Canada doesn't require GFCI. Most dishwashers are hardwired here so you'd have to buy an expensive GFCI breaker. You sure about that code? Our codes are very similar\ndfoley1313: Yes gfci breaker is needed sorry forgot to put \"breaker\" in.  We always run 12/3 one goes to the top which stays hot then we break the tab run the other hot to the switch back to the bottom outlet and you have a outlet that has both a 20amp circuit. There is no problem doing a pig tail on a appliance and plugging it into a outlet instead of just hardwiring it to the device. Again it is a little extra work but it makes installing it easier and is code. I have done a lot of remodels of kitchens and inspectors ALWAYS check for this. \ngottapoop: Ya I just did a little googling and saw that our codes are definitely different for dishwashers. We don't even have anything relating to specifically to dishwashers just that they are a known motor and heating load so they have to be on their own circuit. Most are hardwired luckily because if you put them on a receptacle they would have to be on an AFCI due to new code rules requiring all receptacles unless otherwise stated needing to be AFCI protected.\nDoes the receptacle you install for the dishwasher go on the counter top and you run the power cable up or do you install under the kitchen sink and do the split receptacle thing for future additions like garberators or undercab lighting?\ndfoley1313: Goes under the cabinet usually in the sink base. Never thought of using it for under cab lighting usually just the disposal. Using the 12/3 and the split receptacle is the easiest way to do it. Now most of the times we don't even run a switch for the garbage disposal we just have them both hot but on different home runs, but use a air gap switch for the garbage disposal mounted on the sink.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "So", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Swarming insects are typically dangerous, not just to humans but to their food sources, so we have evolved feelings of *disgust* related to insects or their dwellings.\nSabrinacolada: I have cockroach phobia\n\nText continuation:\nAs the beekeeper, Sarah, carefully placed the new queen bee into the hive, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. She had spent hours preparing for this moment, studying the behavior of the bees and learning how to identify the signs of a failing colony. It was a delicate process, but one that was crucial to the survival of the bees.\nSarah had always been fascinated by bees, and had spent countless hours watching them buzz around her garden. She loved the way they worked together, communicating through complex dances and pheromones, to build their intricate hives. But as she delved deeper into the world of beekeeping, she began to realize the importance of her role. Without beekeepers like her, the bees would be in danger of disappearing, taking with them the vital pollination services that they provided to the environment.\nAs she finished up her task, Sarah couldn't help but think about the many challenges that beekeepers faced. From pesticides and habitat loss, to climate change and disease, the list of threats to bee populations was long and daunting. But despite these challenges, Sarah remained optimistic. She knew that with the right tools and knowledge, beekeepers could make a real difference.\nAs she packed up her equipment and said goodbye to the bees, Sarah felt a sense of gratitude wash over her. She was grateful for the opportunity to make a difference, and for the chance to work with such incredible creatures. And as she walked away from the hive, she couldn't help but feel a sense of hope for the future. With dedicated beekeepers like herself, she knew that the bees would continue to thrive, and that the world would be a sweeter place because of it.\nBut as Sarah walked away from the hive, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She glanced over her shoulder, but there was nothing out of the ordinary. Just the usual bees buzzing around the hive, and the occasional bird flying overhead. But the feeling persisted, and Sarah couldn't help but wonder if she was being stalked by some unknown predator.\nAs she continued on her way, Sarah couldn't help but think about the many myths and legends surrounding bees. From the ancient Greeks, who believed that bees were the offspring of Zeus, to the modern-day fascination with bee venom therapy, the allure of bees was undeniable. And yet, despite their importance, bees were often misunderstood and feared. But Sarah knew that this was far from the truth. Bees were incredible creatures, capable of incredible feats of engineering and communication. And as she walked away from the hive, she felt a sense of pride and respect for these tiny, yet mighty, insects.\nAs the days went by, Sarah noticed that the bees were beginning to thrive. The hive was bustling with activity, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of honey. It was a sign that the colony was healthy and strong, and Sarah felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that she had played a role in their recovery. But as she watched the bees, she couldn't help but wonder what other secrets they held. What other mysteries lay hidden within the walls of the hive?\nAs she pondered this question, Sarah felt a sudden jolt of excitement. She had always been fascinated by the idea of bee communication, and she had spent countless hours studying the complex dances and pheromones that the bees used to communicate. But what if there was more to it than that? What if the bees were capable of something even more incredible?\nAs she stood there, lost in thought, Sarah felt a strange sensation wash over her. It was as if she was being drawn into the hive, pulled towards the very heart of the colony. And as she felt this sensation, she knew that she had to investigate further. She had to uncover the secrets that lay hidden within the walls of the hive.\nWith a sense of determination and excitement, Sarah made her way back to the hive. She knew that it would be a long and difficult journey, but she was ready for the challenge. For she knew that the secrets of the hive were worth uncovering, and that the journey would be worth it in the end.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "To", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I couldn\u2019t do it. I guess I\u2019m stuck. You can\u2019t even Google CR phobia without giant pics of them coming up. That should be illegal.\nKindheartednessNo167: Me,too.

Cardboard\u2014damn. That\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m about to move across the country and was just going to buy boxes this week. Maybe it\u2019s Tupperware for me. \nSomeday, when my kids are grown, I\u2019ll try to move to Iceland. There\u2019s no bugs there. Legitimately heaven in earth for me.\nSabrinacolada: You can move with cardboard, but when you get settled, store everything away in Tupperware. Lock up important files in a cabinet. \nAlso keep drains stoppered and fix all leaky faucets. Doing these things drastically reduced the encounters I had. \nYou\u2019re welcome, I know what triggers me, and I didn\u2019t want to trigger you. :)\nKindheartednessNo167: When I bought our new home, we had a pest control friend pretreat our home for pests.

In Sierra County, Proctor worked as a lawyer and as the assessor of Sierra County. In 1858, he moved with a group of four members from Downieville to Eagle Valley in the area that is now known as Nevada. When they arrived, three members of the group, Curry, Musser, and Proctor, bought the Eagle Ranch for $1,000 and a down payment of $300. The ranch was situated on the current location of Carson City and thus the group founded Carson City with Proctor as a co-founder. In 1864, he claimed to have named the city, but Abraham Curry is generally given credit for that. Proctor owned one\n\nText continuation:\nof the original 15 lots in the town, which he sold for $1,000 in 1861. He later returned to Carson City in 1869 and served as a state senator from 1871 to 1875.\nDuring his time in the Nevada State Senate, Proctor was a strong advocate for the development of the state's infrastructure, particularly in the areas of transportation and education. He was a key figure in the passage of the Nevada State Constitution in 1864 and played a crucial role in the establishment of the University of Nevada in 1874. Proctor's commitment to public service and his leadership abilities earned him widespread respect and admiration from his contemporaries. After leaving the state senate, Proctor continued to practice law in Carson City and remained an active member of the community until his death in 1892. Despite his significant contributions to the founding and development of Carson City, Proctor's legacy has often been overshadowed by that of Abraham Curry, who is more widely recognized as the city's founder. However, Proctor's achievements and accomplishments as a co-founder, state senator, and lawyer have not been forgotten, and he remains an important figure in the history of Nevada.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "#"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "P", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Proctor owned one\n\nText continuation:\n-third of the Eagle Ranch, but gave half of it to Benjamin F. Green, who was the fourth member of the group. In 1859, Proctor was vice-president of a constitutional convention, that had as objective to create Nevada Territory. During the convention, Proctor represented Humboldt County. After Nevada became a territory, he filed his candidacy to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the territory, but he lost.\nProctor was a member of the 1864 Nevada Constitutional Convention, that started on July 4 and produced an approved constitution. He was elected member with 118 votes. Proctor was one of the two members representing Nye County and he was the only Democrat at the Convention; all others were Unionists. Records from the Convention stated that Proctor was married. He was elected senator of Nye County in the Nevada Senate on November 8, 1864, and his term began the following day. He served in three regular sessions and one special session. In the first and second regular session, he was the only Democratic member of the Nevada Senate. Proctor advocated states' rights and legislation to extend suffrage to women and to make it possible for women to hold public office. His term ended in 1868 and he was succeeded by Robert Mullen. During the 1860s or 1870s, he moved to another state and he died in 1892. East and West Proctor Street in Carson City were named after Proctor and in 1995 he was inducted by a senate resolution into the Senate Hall of Fame of Nevada.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Association studies have been widely used to search for associations between common genetic variants observations and a given phenotype. However, it is now generally accepted that genes and environment must be examined jointly when estimating phenotypic variance. In this work we consider two types of biological markers: genotypic markers, which characterize an observation in terms of inherited genetic information, and metagenomic marker which are related to the environment. Both types of markers are available in their millions and can be used to characterize any observation uniquely. Objective. Our focus is on detecting interactions between groups of genetic and metagenomic markers in order to gain a better understanding of the complex relationship between environment and genome\n\nText continuation:\n.\nBy integrating these two types of markers, we aim to uncover novel associations that may not be apparent when examining each type of marker in isolation. This integrated approach will allow us to capture the intricate interplay between genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the development of complex diseases. To achieve this, we will employ advanced statistical methods, such as machine learning algorithms and network analysis, to identify patterns and relationships between the markers.\nOur study will focus on a specific disease or trait, and we will use a large-scale dataset that includes both genotypic and metagenomic information. We will then apply our integrated approach to identify the most relevant markers and their interactions, and to predict the probability of disease or trait development based on the presence or absence of these markers. This will enable us to identify high-risk individuals and develop targeted interventions to prevent or treat the disease.\nFurthermore, our study will also explore the potential applications of our integrated approach in other fields, such as personalized medicine, forensic science, and evolutionary biology. By developing a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between genes and environment, we can gain valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of disease and develop more effective strategies for prevention and treatment.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Contributions. We propose a novel approach for efficiently detecting interactions between complementary datasets in a high-dimensional setting with a reduced computational cost. The method, named SICOMORE, reduces the dimension of the search space by selecting a subset of supervariables in the two complementary datasets. These supervariables are given by a weighted group structure defined on sets of variables at different scales. A Lasso selection is then applied on each type of supervariable to obtain a subset of potential interactions that will be explored via linear model testing. Results. We compare SICOMORE with other approaches in simulations, with varying sample sizes, noise, and numbers of true interactions. SICOMORE exhibits convincing results in terms of recall, as well as competitive performances with respect to running time. The method is also used to detect interaction between genomic markers in Medicago truncatula and metagenomic markers in its rhizosphere bacterial community. Software availability. A R package is available, along with its documentation and associated scripts, allowing the reader to reproduce the results presented in the paper.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Generic programming has proven to be an effective means of constructing libraries of reusable software components in languages that support it. Generics-related language design choices play a major role in how conducive generic programming is in practice. Inquiry: Several mainstream programming languages (e.g. Java and C++) were first created without generics; features to support generic programming were added later, gradually. Much of the existing literature on supporting generic programming focuses thus on retrofitting generic programming into existing languages and identifying related\n\nText continuation:\nchallenges.\nRetrofitting generic programming into existing languages can be a complex task, as it requires careful consideration of the language's syntax, semantics, and type system. For instance, in languages like C++, which have a strong focus on performance and low-level memory management, adding generics can introduce additional overhead and complexity. In contrast, languages like Java, which have a more abstracted view of memory management, may be more amenable to generics.\nOne of the key challenges in retrofitting generic programming is ensuring that the resulting code is both efficient and type-safe. This requires a deep understanding of the language's type system and the properties of the data types being used. Additionally, the introduction of generics can introduce new challenges related to compatibility and interoperability with existing code.\nDespite these challenges, retrofitting generic programming into existing languages has been shown to be a valuable endeavor. By providing a way to write reusable and efficient algorithms, generics can help to reduce the complexity and maintainability of software systems. Furthermore, the ability to write generic code can enable the creation of more flexible and adaptable software components, which can be particularly valuable in rapidly changing environments.\nIn addition to retrofitting generic programming into existing languages, researchers have also explored the development of new programming languages that support generic programming from the outset. These languages, such as Rust and Swift, have been designed with generics in mind from the very beginning, and have the potential to provide more seamless and efficient support for generic programming.\nOverall, the study of generic programming and its implementation in various programming languages is an active area of research, with many open questions and challenges to be addressed. As the demand for more efficient and reusable software components continues to grow, the development of effective generic programming strategies will play a critical role in meeting this demand.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "To", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Is the programming experience significantly better, or different when programming with a language designed for generic programming without limitations from prior language design choices? Approach: We examine Magnolia, a language designed to embody generic programming. Magnolia is representative of an approach to language design rooted in algebraic specifications. We repeat a well-known experiment, where we put Magnolia's generic programming facilities under scrutiny by implementing a subset of the Boost Graph Library, and reflect on our development experience. Knowledge: We discover that the idioms identified as key features for supporting Stepanov-style generic programming in the previous studies and work on the topic do not tell a full story. We clarify which of them are more of a means to an end, rather than fundamental features for supporting generic programming. Based on the development experience with Magnolia, we identify variadics as an additional key feature for generic programming and point out limitations and challenges of genericity by property. Grounding: Our work uses a well-known framework for evaluating the generic programming facilities of a language from the literature to evaluate the algebraic approach through Magnolia, and we draw comparisons with well-known programming languages. Importance: This work gives a fresh perspective on generic programming, and clarifies what are fundamental language properties and their trade-offs when considering supporting Stepanov-style generic programming. The understanding of how to set the ground for generic programming will inform future language design.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Criticism and discussion are much welcome.\njustsackpat: Would vegans welcome a world in which there are no livestock animals? \nAnimals such as cows, sheep &amp; chickens have been looked after &amp; selectively bred over thousands of years to provide humans with a product (food, fabric, fertiliser etc). The only reason they exist is to be of material use to Homo sapiens. It makes sense for humans to care for these animals, though I understand modern food production is blurred with profit margins, unfortunately. Most farmers genuinely care for the livestock they manage. \nWhy would anyone look after cows if they have no end use? Because they\u2019re cute? What a joke... The only way to totally end cruelty to cows is for there to be no cows at\n\nText continuation:\nall. But what about the consequences of such a drastic change? Would we be willing to sacrifice the livelihoods of millions of farmers and their families, not to mention the impact on the environment and the economy? \nIt's not as simple as just abolishing livestock, as it would have far-reaching effects on our entire food system. We would need to find alternative sources of protein and nutrients, which could lead to unintended consequences such as increased reliance on industrial farming methods or the exploitation of other animal species. \nFurthermore, the idea that animals exist solely for human use is a simplistic view that neglects the complex relationships between humans and animals. Many animals have evolved alongside humans, and their existence has shaped our cultures, societies, and environments. The loss of these species would not only be a tragedy for the animals themselves but also for humanity. \nRather than seeking to eradicate livestock, perhaps we should focus on reevaluating our relationship with animals and the way we produce and consume food. We could strive for more sustainable and humane farming practices, such as regenerative agriculture, which prioritizes soil health, biodiversity, and animal welfare. \nThis approach would not only benefit the animals but also the environment, as it would promote soil carbon sequestration, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase ecosystem resilience. It would also support local communities and small-scale farmers, ensuring that the benefits of food production are shared equitably. \nIn conclusion, while the idea of a world without livestock animals may seem appealing at first glance, it is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of the consequences. Rather than seeking to eradicate animals, we should work towards a more compassionate and sustainable food system that prioritizes animal welfare, environmental stewardship, and social justice.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

We all need to try to buy local &amp; welfare quality assured produce. \nThe death of an animal is not a big deal. Poor treatment of them while they are alive is.\nTinac4: &gt; The death of an animal is not a big deal. Poor treatment of them while they are alive is.\nHow universally do you apply this principle?\nConsider a hypothetical human society where a number of kids are raised under the best possible conditions.  All of them are happy and satisfied, until they are killed painlessly and without warning at the age of 15.  Is this ethical?  If not, what makes this scenario different?\n[deleted]: Depends on your definition of 'ethics'. I argue that it wouldn't be unethical to kill 'isolately'. To kill any living being is 'fine' as long as their death does not inflict suffering on other living beings. For example, to kill a calf would be 'wrong' because their mother would suffer by cause of their death.\nHowever, if said calf existed in isolation and their death did not cause emotional or physical harm on others \u2013 and the procedure was to be done painlessly \u2013 I can see no problem with their murder. It does not matter if it is an individual of our species or another's.\nTinac4: I personally disagree--I'm more of a preference utilitarian than a classical utilitarian--but I see where you're coming from.  It does seem to me that your position leads to some unintuitive results, though.  For instance, if you came across a sleeping homeless man, you had a method to kill him painlessly and take his money, and you knew with certainty that nobody would care about or notice his death, would it be ethical to kill him?  (Obviously, this involves a lot of simplifications that don't apply in real life.)\n[deleted]: &gt; would it be ethical to kill him?\nI suppose we're having a mature discussion here so I'm going to answer honestly. Simply put, yes.

Forming effective coalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems. Central to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many possible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually requires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the coalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it was formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a combination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one coalition, and by which the overall outcome of the\n\nText continuation:\nsystem is maximized.\nOne of the key challenges in coalition formation is the problem of finding the optimal coalition structure, which is the combination of coalitions that maximizes the overall outcome of the system. This problem is often referred to as the coalition structure problem. To solve this problem, agents need to be able to communicate with each other and share information about their goals, preferences, and capabilities. They also need to be able to negotiate and make agreements with each other in order to form coalitions that are beneficial to all parties involved.\nAnother important aspect of coalition formation is the problem of coalition stability. This refers to the ability of a coalition to withstand the temptation of individual agents to defect and form new coalitions that are more beneficial to them. In order to achieve stability, coalitions need to be able to provide a sufficient level of benefits to all agents involved, and agents need to be able to trust each other to keep their commitments.\nCoalition formation has many applications in real-world systems, such as business, politics, and social networks. For example, in business, companies may form coalitions with other companies to share resources and expertise, or to collaborate on joint projects. In politics, parties may form coalitions with other parties to achieve a common goal, such as winning an election. In social networks, individuals may form coalitions with other individuals to achieve a common goal, such as organizing a protest or a charity event.\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to solve coalition formation problems. These techniques can be used to analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns and relationships that can help agents make more informed decisions about which coalitions to form. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the outcomes of different coalitions, and to identify the most promising coalitions to form.\nOverall, coalition formation is a complex and challenging problem that has many applications in real-world systems. By understanding the principles and challenges of coalition formation, we can develop more effective strategies for achieving our goals and building more effective coalitions.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

However, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging due to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows exponentially with the number of agents involved. To date, therefore, many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem using different techniques ranging from dynamic programming, to integer programming, to stochastic search all of which suffer from major limitations relating to execution time, solution quality, and memory requirements. With this in mind, we develop an anytime algorithm to solve the coalition structure generation problem. Specifically, the algorithm uses a novel representation of the search space, which partitions the space of possible solutions into sub-spaces such that it is possible to compute upper and lower bounds on the values of the best coalition structures in them. These bounds are then used to identify the sub-spaces that have no potential of containing the optimal solution so that they can be pruned. The algorithm, then, searches through the remaining sub-spaces very efficiently using a branch-and-bound technique to avoid examining all the solutions within the searched subspace(s). In this setting, we prove that our algorithm enumerates all coalition structures efficiently by avoiding redundant and invalid solutions automatically. Moreover, in order to effectively test our algorithm we develop a new type of input distribution which allows us to generate more reliable benchmarks compared to the input distributions previously used in the field. Given this new distribution, we show that for 27 agents our algorithm is able to find solutions that are optimal in 0.175% of the time required by the fastest available algorithm in the literature. The algorithm is anytime, and if interrupted before it would have normally terminated, it can still provide a solution that is guaranteed to be within a bound from the optimal one. Moreover, the guarantees we provide on the quality of the solution are significantly better than those provided by the previous state of the art algorithms designed for this purpose. For example, for the worst case distribution given 25 agents, our algorithm is able to find a 90% efficient solution in around 10% of time it takes to find the optimal solution.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Two new underground stations will be constructed to serve the city centre: Te Waihorotiu near Aotea Square and Karanga-a-Hape near Karangahape Road. Waitemat\u0101 will be converted from a terminus station into a through station, and Mount Eden station will be replaced by Maungawhau station, a new station with four platforms to serve as an interchange between the new CRL line and the existing Western Line.\nThe current project is an adapted version of previous proposals to improve rail access to Auckland's city centre with\n\nText continuation:\na focus on increasing capacity and reducing congestion on the rail network. The project aims to provide a reliable and efficient public transport system, connecting the city centre with the surrounding suburbs and regions. The CRL will also provide a vital link to the airport, with a new station planned at the airport to provide easy access to the city centre.\nThe construction of the CRL is expected to be completed by 2024, with the new stations and tunnel expected to be operational by 2025. The project is being delivered by a joint venture of construction companies, including Downer EDI Works, Obayashi Corporation, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The project is being funded by the New Zealand government, Auckland Council, and Auckland Transport, with an estimated cost of NZD 4.4 billion.\nOnce completed, the CRL will provide numerous benefits to the city and its residents, including increased capacity, reduced congestion, and improved air quality. The project will also create new economic opportunities and stimulate growth in the city centre. With the CRL, Auckland will be able to better accommodate its growing population and provide a more efficient and reliable public transport system, making it a more attractive place to live, work, and visit.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I was getting the hang of it, but then I realized I didn't have any screws left. My dad had taken the rest of them with him, and I was left with nothing but a pile of scraps.\nI decided to take a break and go get some more screws from the hardware store. I grabbed a few packs of screws and headed back home. When I got back, my dad was still working on the fence, but he was getting frustrated. The wood was still damp from the rain, and the screws were having trouble going in. I suggested we use some wood glue to help the screws hold better, but my dad was skeptical.\nWe decided to take a break and come back to it later. As we were walking back to the house, my dad mentioned that he had an idea for a new type of screw that would work better in damp wood. He had seen it at a trade show a few months ago and had been thinking about trying it out. I was skeptical, but he seemed convinced that it would work.\nThe next day, we headed back to the fence and started working on it again. This time, we used the new screws and some wood glue. It took a few hours, but we finally got the fence fixed. It was a bit more expensive than we had hoped, but it was worth it to have a sturdy fence that would last for years to come.\nAs we were finishing up, my dad turned to me and said, \"You know, I'm glad we did this. It's been a good bonding experience for us.\" I agreed, and we both felt a sense of accomplishment as we stood back and admired our handiwork.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Can I just use nails? Does it need to be these crappy screws? Are the screws at fault, or it is just too cold out to do this stuff?\n\nEdit : Also, if there's any suggestions on removing screws from a post that broke off and have been cut flush to the wood, I would love them.\njakkarth: Use vice grip pliers to remove the broken screw. Screws will last a lot longer than nails if you can manage to get them installed. The kind of screws you want are \"decking\" or \"exterior coated\" screws. If you have trouble driving them in, use a 1/8\" drill bit to predrill the holes. Go about the length of the screw minus half an inch deep with the drill bit, then drive the screw in the hole.\n[deleted]: Yeah, no exterior coated anything. A few rust coated screws about the same size/shape that I could clean off. \nThe nails are left-overs from when we (my neighbors and beer) put together a patio, but I can only assume (because the neighbour got them, not us) that they were rated for outdoors.\njakkarth: If they're not coated, they'll rot/rust. That'll lead to poor structural performance (your fence falls apart) and discoloration (black stains trailing down from the screw heads). In some cases the exterior rated screws are also stronger than their interior counterparts.\n[deleted]: What i'm taking from that is \"Exterior coated nails, though inferior to exterior coated screws, are preferable to interior coated screws\"?\njakkarth: That is my recommendation, yes. I would not build a fence for my mother using anything less than exterior coated screws, but given a choice between galvanized/exterior nails and drywall/interior screws, I'd go with the nails.\n[deleted]: Thanks, your mother is a lucky lady. I'm going to grab some exterior screws later in the day, and make sure to drill in some holes before I try to install 'em.\nAlso, the pliers didn't work to pull out the screw, it just stripped the screw more. So I cut it off. Is that \"ok\", or are there screw-removal pliers is should look into?\njakkarth: I'd probably leave it. The [vice grip](http://tungstencarbidefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/vicegrip.jpg) pliers are my go-to for removing screws with broken-off heads, so if that didn't work you're probably better off just cutting it off.

Because they are based on a straightforward formalism, they are used in many scientific fields from computer science to historical sciences. In this paper, we give an introduction to some methods relying on graphs for learning. This includes both unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in latent spaces and/or clustering the nodes. Both focus on extracting knowledge from graph topologies. While most existing techniques are only applicable to static graphs, where edges do not evolve through time, recent developments have shown that they could be extended to deal with evolving networks. In a supervised context, one generally aims at inferring labels\n\nText continuation:\n.\nFor instance, in the field of computer vision, graphs have been used to model the relationships between pixels in an image, allowing for the recognition of objects and scenes. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent pixels, and the edges represent the spatial relationships between them. By applying graph-based algorithms to this graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the image that are not easily discernible by other means. This has led to significant advances in image recognition and segmentation.\nIn addition to computer vision, graphs have also been used in other fields such as social network analysis, where they are used to model the relationships between individuals or groups. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent individuals or groups, and the edges represent the relationships between them, such as friendship, family relationships, or professional connections. By analyzing the graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the relationships between individuals or groups, which can be used to gain insights into social phenomena.\nFurthermore, graphs have also been used in biology to model the relationships between genes, proteins, and other biological molecules. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent the molecules, and the edges represent the interactions between them, such as protein-protein interactions or gene regulation. By analyzing the graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the relationships between molecules, which can be used to gain insights into biological processes and to identify potential therapeutic targets.\nIn conclusion, graphs are a powerful tool for characterizing interactions between objects of interest, and they have been used in a wide range of fields, from computer science to biology. By applying graph-based algorithms to these graphs, it is possible to extract knowledge and insights that would not be easily discernible by other means. As the field of graph-based learning continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more innovative applications of graphs in the future.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Balancing the two sources of information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally or globally. In both contexts, supervised and un-supervised, data can be relational (augmented with one or several global graphs) as described above, or graph valued. In this latter case, each object of interest is given as a full graph (possibly completed by other characteristics). In this context, natural tasks include graph clustering (as in producing clusters of graphs rather than clusters of nodes in a single graph), graph classification, etc. 1 Real networks One of the first practical studies on graphs can be dated back to the original work of Moreno [51] in the 30s. Since then, there has been a growing interest in graph analysis associated with strong developments in the modelling and the processing of these data. Graphs are now used in many scientific fields. In Biology [54, 2, 7], for instance, metabolic networks can describe pathways of biochemical reactions [41], while in social sciences networks are used to represent relation ties between actors [66, 56, 36, 34]. Other examples include powergrids [71] and the web [75]. Recently, networks have also been considered in other areas such as geography [22] and history [59, 39]. In machine learning, networks are seen as powerful tools to model problems in order to extract information from data and for prediction purposes. This is the object of this paper. For more complete surveys, we refer to [28, 62, 49, 45]. In this section, we introduce notations and highlight properties shared by most real networks. In Section 2, we then consider methods aiming at extracting information from a unique network. We will particularly focus on clustering methods where the goal is to find clusters of vertices.

He said he *strongly* recommended against it, but that, yes, it'd be easy to chase a skunk down there and get sprayed.\nMy reasons why I don't think it'd be so bad are as follows:\n1) It's just a smell. I don't see how a bad smell could be an effective animal defense.\n2) It lasts a long time, but I don\n\nText continuation:\n't think it'd be that unbearable. I mean, I've smelled some pretty strong smells before and managed just fine. A skunk's spray is probably just another variation of that.\n3) It's not like I'd be hurt or anything. I know skunks are generally harmless, and they're not going to attack me unless I'm threatening them. And even then, they'd probably just warn me off with a little spray instead of going full-on attack mode.\n4) I'm curious about the experience. I think it'd be kind of cool to know what it's like to be on the receiving end of that famous skunk smell. And who knows, maybe it'd even be a fun story to tell later.\nBut, I guess I could be wrong. Maybe getting sprayed by a skunk is way worse than I think it is. Maybe it's not just a smell, but a smell that's so overwhelming and unpleasant that it's actually traumatic. Maybe it's not just a temporary thing, but a smell that lingers for weeks or even months. Maybe it's not just a minor annoyance, but a major inconvenience that ruins my life for a while.\nI'm really hoping someone can talk me out of this. I'm curious about what you all think. Is getting sprayed by a skunk really that bad, or is it just a minor annoyance? Has anyone ever been sprayed by a skunk and lived to tell the tale? What was it like? Was it as bad as everyone makes it out to be?\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I don't see how a bad smell could be an effective animal defense.\nRemember that most animals are much more dependent on smell than humans are.  What might be inadequate defense against humans would be a stronger deterrent to a predator - not to mention interfering with its ability to smell for some time afterwards.  \n&gt;Yes, it apparently can cause blindness, but goggles would solve that problem.\nOr vomiting, or (rarely) hemolytic anemia.\n&gt;It lasts a long time, but I don't have work for 4 days.\nDo you have any social engagements during that time?  Are you an extreme introvert?  Most people would rather not stay home alone for days on end.  But you will be persona non grata in most social situations.\nyogofoxy: Well, yes, it would be worse for animals - but I'm a human, so I don't think that would be a huge concern.\nHow does it caught anemia, or vomitting? I haven't heard of that.\nFor the next 4 days I mostly had planned on relaxing anyways, during a rare vacation from work - so with regards to that, I don't think that's a concern either. Besides, I could wash the smell off somehow, I would think.\nGnosticGnome: The vomiting is from the stench; the thiols can for some people cause hemolytic anemia due to oxidative stress\nyogofoxy: I've never actually seen or heard of anyone vomit from a bad smell alone, except in cartoons. Is that a real-life thing? I can't even see any examples of it online.\nGnosticGnome: I've seen it happen in real life.  Yes, it's a thing.  Presumably the evolutionary benefit would be that we avoid eating spoiled food even when we're hungry because the smell makes us nauseated, and throw up contaminated food we've just eaten once we receive that olfactory data that it's likely too spoiled.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

We adapt the approach of Dennis Sullivan, which treats a spin structure on a Riemann surface M as a complex line bundle S whose square is the canonical line bundle K=T(M). Given a conformal immersion of M into \\bbR^3, the unique spin strucure on S^2 pulls back via the Gauss map to a spin structure S on M, and gives rise to a pair of smooth sections (s_1,s_2) of S. Conversely, any pair of sections of S generates a (possibly periodic) conformal immersion of M under a suitable integrability condition, which for a minimal surface is simply that the spinor sections are meromorphic. A spin structure S also determines (and is determined by) the regular homotopy class of the immersion by way of a \\bbZ_2-quadratic\n\nText continuation:\n.\nThis spinor representation provides a powerful tool for studying conformal immersions of Riemann surfaces into space. By analyzing the properties of the spinor sections, we can gain insight into the geometry and topology of the immersion. For example, the meromorphicity of the spinor sections is closely related to the existence of a conformal metric on the surface, and the regular homotopy class of the immersion is determined by the spin structure.\nFurthermore, the spinor representation can be used to study the relationship between conformal immersions and other geometric objects, such as holomorphic curves and harmonic maps. For instance, a holomorphic curve in \\bbC^2 can be viewed as a conformal immersion of a Riemann surface into \\bbC^2, and the spinor representation can be used to study the properties of this immersion.\nIn addition, the spinor representation has applications in other areas of mathematics and physics, such as the study of topological invariants and the classification of conformal field theories. The spinor representation provides a powerful tool for studying these topics, and has been used to make important advances in these areas.\nIn conclusion, the spinor representation is a powerful tool for studying conformal immersions of Riemann surfaces into space.

We present an analytic expression for the Arf invariant of q_S, which decides whether or not the correponding immersion can be deformed to an embedding. The Arf invariant also turns out to be an obstruction, for example, to the existence of certain complete minimal immersions. The later parts of this paper use the spinor representation to investigate minimal surfaces with embedded planar ends. In general, we show for a spin structure S on a compact Riemann surface M with punctures at P that the space of all such (possibly periodic) minimal immersions of M\\setminus P into \\bbR^3 (upto homothety) is the the product of S^1\\times H^3 with the Grassmanian of 2-planes in a complex vector space \\calK of meromorphic sections of S. An important tool -- a skew-symmetric form \\Omega defined by residues of a certain meromorphic quadratic differential on M -- lets us compute how \\calK varies as M and P are varied. Then we apply this to determine the moduli spaces of planar-ended minimal spheres and real projective planes, and also to construct a new family of minimal tori and a minimal Klein bottle with 4 ends. These surfaces compactify in S^3 to yield surfaces critical for the \\Moebius invariant squared mean curvature functional W. On the other hand, Robert Bryant has shown all W-critical spheres and real projective planes arise this way. Thus we find at the same time the moduli spaces of W-critical spheres and real projective planes via the spinor representation.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "H", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Both", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Each redo log file consists of redo records. A redo record, also called a redo entry, holds a group of change vectors, each of which describes or represents a change made to a single block in the database.\nFor example, if a user UPDATEs a salary-value in a table containing employee-related data, the DBMS generates a redo record containing change-vectors that describe changes to the data segment block for the table. And if the user then COMMITs the update, Oracle generates another redo record and assigns the change a \"system change number\" (SCN).\nWhenever something changes in a datafile, Oracle records the change in the redo log. The name redo log indicates its purpose: If the database crashes, the RDBMS can redo (re-process) all changes on datafiles which will take the database data back to the state it was when the last redo record was written. DBAs use the views V$LOG, V$LOGFILE, V$LOG_HISTORY and V$THREAD to find information about the redo log of the database. Each redo log file belongs to exactly one group (of which at least two must exist). Exactly one of these groups is the CURRENT group (can be queried using the column status of v$log). Oracle uses that current group to write the redo log entries. When the group is full, a log switch occurs, making another group the current one. Each log switch causes checkpoint, however, the converse is not true: a checkpoint does not cause a redo log switch. One can also manually cause a redo-log switch using the ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE command.\n\nSummary:\nRedo logs in Oracle RDBMS are files in a proprietary format that log a history of all changes made to the database, allowing the database to be recovered in case of a crash.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

David Paterson of New York has told state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states and countries where they are legal, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. The governor's legal counsel told state agencies in a May 14 memo to revise policies and regulations to recognize same-sex marriages performed in California and Massachusetts as well as Canada and other countries that allow gays and lesbians to marry, said Erin Duggan, the governor's spokeswoman. The memo informed state agencies that failing to recognize gay marriages would violate the New York's human rights law, Duggan said. The directive follows a February ruling from a New York state appeals court. That decision says that legal same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions are entitled to recognition in New York. \"This was in direct response to a court ruling,\" Duggan told CNN. \"Just to make sure all the state agencies are on the same page.\"  See what rules your state has about same-sex unions \u00bb . Duggan says that the court's decision was consistent with the findings of several lower courts in New York State. The governor's legal counsel sent the memo one day before the California Supreme Court struck down a ban on gay marriage in that state. Court officials in California counties may begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 17, state officials said Wednesday. Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriages in 2004, and gay couples need not be state residents there to wed. However, then-Gov. Mitt Romney resurrected a 1913 law barring non-resident marriages in the state if the marriage would be prohibited in the partners' home state. Subsequent court and agency decisions have determined that only residents of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Mexico may marry in Massachusetts, unless the parties say they plan to move there after the marriage.

David Paterson of New York has told state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states and countries where they are legal, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. The governor's legal counsel told state agencies in a May 14 memo to revise policies and regulations to recognize same-sex marriages performed in California and Massachusetts as well as Canada and other countries that allow gays and lesbians to marry, said Erin Duggan, the governor's spokeswoman. The memo informed state agencies that failing to recognize gay marriages would violate the New York's human rights law, Duggan said. The directive follows a February ruling from a New York state appeals court. That decision says that legal same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions are entitled to recognition in New York. \"This was in direct response to a court ruling,\" Duggan told CNN. \"Just to make sure all the state agencies are on the same page.\"  See what rules your state has about same-sex unions \u00bb . Duggan says that the court's decision was consistent with the findings of several lower courts in New York State. The governor's legal counsel sent the memo one day before the California Supreme Court struck down a ban on gay marriage in that state. Court officials in California counties may begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 17, state officials said Wednesday. Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriages in 2004, and gay couples need not be state residents there to wed. However, then-Gov. Mitt Romney resurrected a 1913 law barring non-resident marriages in the state if the marriage would be prohibited in the partners' home state. Subsequent court and agency decisions have determined that only residents of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Mexico may marry in Massachusetts, unless the parties say they plan to move there after the marriage. New Hampshire, Vermont, New Jersey and Connecticut permit civil unions, while California has a domestic-partner registration law. More than a dozen other states give same-sex couples some legal rights, as do some other countries.\n\nSummary:\nMemo: Failing to recognize gay marriages would violate New York's human rights law\nThe directive follows a February ruling from a New York state appeals court\nMassachusetts legalized same-sex marriages in 2004\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "**"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Placing the packaged food in a water bath, with the temperature set at the desired final cooking temperature of the food, prevents overcooking, because the food cannot get hotter than the bath it is in, as in bain-marie.\nAs a result of precise temperature control of the bath and the fact that the bath temperature is the same as the target cooking temperature, very precise control of cooking can be achieved. Additionally, temperature, and thus cooking, can be very even throughout the food in sous vide cooking, even with irregularly shaped and very thick items, given enough time.\n\nSummary:\nBy contrast, in conventional high-heat cooking, such as oven roasting or grilling, the food is exposed to heat levels that are much higher than the desired internal cooking temperature, and it must be removed from the high heat prior to reaching the desired cooking temperature. If the food is removed from the heat too late, it becomes overcooked, and if it is removed too early, it is undercooked.\nThe use of temperatures much lower than those used for conventional cooking is an essential feature of sous vide. When cooking meat, tough collagen in connective tissue can be denatured into gelatin, without heating the meat's proteins high enough that they denature to a degree that the texture toughens and moisture is exuded from the meat.\nIn contrast, soft vegetables are often considered overcooked. Low-temperature cooking allows plant matter to remain more succulent, as the cell walls do not burst. Cooking vegetables at temperatures below the boiling point of water allows them to be thoroughly cooked (and pasteurized, if necessary) while maintaining a firm or somewhat crisp texture. While the cell walls will generally not burst, the depolymerization of the pectic polysaccharides that connect the vegetable cells together and the gelatinisation of starch in the vegetable can be achieved without overcooking.\nFrom a culinary viewpoint, the exclusion of air is secondary, but this has practical importance. It allows cooked food to be stored, still sealed and refrigerated, for considerable times, which is especially useful for the catering industry, and it excludes oxygen from food that requires long cooking and is susceptible to oxidation, e.g., fat on meat, which may become rancid with prolonged exposure to air. It also improves the transfer of heat between the water bath and food, without the thermal insulating properties of any trapped air in the bag.\nApart from ensuring uniform cooking, sous vide cooking facilitates development of desired organoleptic flavors and limits off flavors due to oxidation\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "#"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

As a participant of the fully automated track of the competition, MIPS has proven to be a general system; in each track\n\nText continuation:\nand every benchmark domain it efficiently computed plans of remarkable quality. This article introduces and analyzes the most important algorithmic novelties that were necessary to tackle the new layers of expressiveness in the benchmark problems and to achieve a high level of performance. The extensions include critical path analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal parallel plans. The linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses known NP hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect to the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations. The efficiency of this algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance: for each encountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is scheduled. One major strength of MIPS is its static analysis phase that grounds and simplifies parameterized predicates, functions and operators, that infers knowledge to minimize the state description length, and that detects domain object symmetries. The latter aspect is analyzed in detail. MIPS has been developed to serve as a complete and optimal state space planner, with admissible estimates, exploration engines and branching cuts. In the competition version, however, certain performance compromises had to be made, including floating point arithmetic, weighted heuristic search exploration according to an inadmissible estimate and parameterized optimization.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Companies take advantage of the fact that women are often willing to pay more for products that are marketed as \"feminine\" or \"pink\". It's not just razors, it's everything from shampoo to makeup to clothing. And it's not just about the price, it's about the message it sends. It's saying that women are willing to pay more for things that are marketed to them, and that they're not worth the same as men.\nGurgaon_ka_bachha: Exactly! And it's not just about the price, it's about the societal implications. When companies price their products higher for women, it perpetuates the idea that women are somehow less valuable than men. It's a subtle form of sexism, but it's still sexism.\nRedPillSailor: I see what you're saying, but I still think price controls are a bad idea. It's better to let the market decide what prices are fair. If companies are charging too much for their products, then people will just choose not to buy them.\nWTF_HomeSlice: But that's not always an option for women, especially those who are low-income or living in poverty. They may not have the luxury of choosing not to buy something because it's too expensive. That's why I think the government should step in and make sure that these products are affordable for everyone.\nMy wife and I have talked about this a lot, and we've come to the realization that we need to be more mindful of the products we buy and the companies we support. We try to buy from companies that are transparent about their pricing and that don't engage in discriminatory pricing practices.\nGurgaon_ka_bachha: That's a great point! Consumers have the power to make a change by voting with their wallets. By supporting companies that are fair and transparent, we can send a message that we won't tolerate discriminatory pricing practices.\nRedPillSailor: I agree, but I still think that government intervention is not the best solution. It's better to let the market decide what prices are fair, and to educate consumers about the products they're buying.\nWTF_HomeSlice: But what about the women who don't have the education or the resources to make informed decisions about the products they're buying? They're the ones who are most affected by discriminatory pricing practices, and they're the ones who need the most help.\nGurgaon_ka_bachha: That's a great point. The government has a role to play in protecting the most vulnerable members of society, including low-income women. By regulating prices and ensuring that products are affordable, the government can help to level the playing field and promote fairness and equality.\nRedPillSailor: I see what you're saying, but I still think that government intervention is not the best solution.

She said she was leaving work early, and we'd meet at her hair dressers. I was aghast at the hair dresser running fingers through her hair, primping, and cooing over \"how beautiful your hair is\" that she gave my sister. That is the $40 difference.\nAll I ever got from a barber, was locker-room jokes ... he got his $3 tip. The last time I went to a barber was about 1992. We were poor and to save money, my wife bought a $20 hair clipper from Longs. She's cut my hair for the past 27 years. I think we're on our 4 hair clipper, so $80 for 27 years. Less than $3 a year is pretty affordable. The tips are a little different though.\nTheVastWaistband: Are you kidding?\nThere are many men only barbershops here set you up with a beer when you walk in. Then they do scalp massage, and do a traditional hot towel treatment and shave with straight razor. They also do nose hair, ear, and unibrow waxing and fingernail filing and buffing.\nAlso, you say you don't even go to barbershops and do at home buzzcuts....so you're proclaiming yourself uniquely uninformed in your opinion\nElectricRook1: Why should I waste my money on getting my ego massaged?\nTheVastWaistband: ....you know that taking the time to get a nice haircut and a.shave doesn't mean you're some kind of pussy or faggot right?

However, I do have a few suggestions to consider:\n* For strengthening your back, you may want to consider adding some exercises that target the latissimus dorsi muscles, such as pull-ups or assisted pull-ups. You're already doing chin-ups, which is a great start, but you may want to consider increasing the difficulty by adding weight or using a resistance band.\n* For your wrists and forearms, you're doing a good job with the grip exercises and fingertip planks. However, you may want to consider adding some exercises that target the forearm muscles, such as wrist curls or forearm extensions.\n* For handstand push-ups, you may want to consider adding some exercises that target the shoulder muscles, such as push-ups or shoulder press. You're already doing decline pike push-ups, which is a great exercise for building strength, but you may want to consider adding some variations to target different muscle groups.\nHere's an example of how you could modify your routine to incorporate some of these suggestions:\nOn Days (every 2nd day):\n* Warm-Up w. Wrist Warm-Up (10min)\n* 4x3 Chin-Ups (Building strength for Pull-Ups)\n* 3x4 Beginner Shrimp Squats\n* 3x8 Decline Pike Push-Ups\n* 3x8 Flat Straight Leg Raises\n* 3x15s Fingertip Planks (Weak wrists, building strength for Fingertip Push-Ups)\n* 3x30s Arched Hold\n* 3x45s Reverse Plank Bridge\n* 3x30s Hollow Body Hold\n* 3x10 Wrist Curls (Forearm strength)\n* 3x10 Forearm Extensions (Forearm strength)\n* 3x8 Pull-Ups (Building strength for Handstand Push-Ups)\n* 3x60s Weighed Plank\n* 10s [Yaad Lean](http://antranik.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/yaad-lean.jpg)\n* Cool-Down (6-7min)\nOff Days\nYou could also consider adding some active recovery exercises on your off days, such as light cardio or yoga, to help with recovery and prevent injury. Additionally, you may want to consider increasing the difficulty of your exercises over time by adding weight, increasing the number of reps, or decreasing rest time between sets.\nOverall, your routine is a great start, and with a few modifications, you can continue to make progress towards your goals.

But why stop there ? Is time a constraint ?\nYou can strengthen pretty much the whole body if you add in progressions for horizontal push(PPPUs) and pull (Tuck lever rows) to your current routine which already has vertical push, pull and legs. You might have to split up the days into push/pull days like in the recommend routine or into verical/horizontal days (my current routine) with rest days inbetween. \nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Train everything so that there are no weak links. The choice is upto you though :)\nihatepepperballs: Back and forearms/wrists are my biggest weakness right now, so that's what I'm focusing on.\nBy the way: how could I split this into two parts? I would like to do the first half in the morning, then the second one in the afternoon.\nThanks for the input :)\nn3ox1ne: Its a 2 day split. For example, Monday would be horizontal day with pushups/rows/core. Tuesday would be rest day and Wednesday would be vertical day with pullups/dips(will move to hspu after getting good stable handstands)/legs. Thursday would be rest and Friday would be horizontal again and it just repeats like that every day, rest, train, rest.\nThis is my personal routine modified from the recommend one. It makes sense to me and works for me. It might be different for you. Stick to the recommend routine for 2 or 3 months atleast and then make changes if needed. Good luck and enjoy this journey :D\nihatepepperballs: I feel like that's too much rest time, especially for a teenager. I want action, dammit :D\nAre you sure it would be more beneficial to split it into two days when I could do the whole thing in one?\nn3ox1ne: Your recovery time will have to increase especially after progressing to the intermediate movements. The tendons and joints will need more rest between sessions. Otherwise you will overtrain the body and get injured. Remember this is not a race. Take it slow and stay injury free.

Semantic clustering is one such technique for modularization of the system that relies on the informal semantics of the program, encoded in the vocabulary used in the source code. Treating the source code as a collection of tokens loses the semantic information embedded within the identifiers. We try to overcome this problem by introducing context models for source code identifiers to obtain a semantic kernel, which can be used for both deriving the topics that run through the system as well as their clustering. In the first model, we abstract an identifier to its type representation and build on this notion of context to construct contextual\n\nText continuation:\nrepresentations for each identifier. These representations are then used to compute the semantic similarity between identifiers, which is crucial for identifying the relationships between them.\nBy using contextual representations, we can capture the nuances of the program's semantics, such as the relationships between variables, functions, and classes. This allows us to identify the topics that are relevant to the program's functionality, and to cluster the identifiers based on their semantic similarity. In addition, we can also use these contextual representations to compute the semantic distance between identifiers, which can be used to identify the most similar or dissimilar identifiers in the program.\nOur approach has several advantages over traditional approaches to program comprehension. Firstly, it allows us to capture the semantic information embedded in the source code, which is essential for understanding the program's behavior and functionality. Secondly, it provides a more accurate and nuanced representation of the program's semantics, which can be used to identify the relationships between identifiers and to cluster them based on their semantic similarity. Finally, it can be used to compute the semantic distance between identifiers, which can be used to identify the most similar or dissimilar identifiers in the program.\nIn future work, we plan to extend our approach to include additional features, such as the program's control flow and data flow, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the program's behavior and functionality. We also plan to evaluate our approach on a larger scale, using a variety of programming languages and programming paradigms, to demonstrate its effectiveness and versatility.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The second notion of context is defined based on the flow of data between identifiers to represent a module as a dependency graph where the nodes correspond to identifiers and the edges represent the data dependencies between pairs of identifiers. We have applied our approach to 10 medium-sized open source Java projects, and show that by introducing contexts for identifiers, the quality of the modularization of the software systems is improved. Both of the context models give results that are superior to the plain vector representation of documents. In some cases, the authoritativeness of decompositions is improved by 67%. Furthermore, a more detailed evaluation of our approach on JEdit, an open source editor, demonstrates that inferred topics through performing topic analysis on the contextual representations are more meaningful compared to the plain representation of the documents. The proposed approach in introducing a context model for source code identifiers paves the way for building tools that support developers in program comprehension tasks such as application and domain concept location, software modularization and topic analysis.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "respond", "answer_neg": "#"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In this context, the term can refer both to a theoretically perfect arrangement of hypothetical materials that would have been developed using nanotechnology at the molecular, atomic, or subatomic level (in which case this interpretation of computronium could be unobtainium), and to the best possible achievable form using currently available and used computational materials.\nAccording to the Barrow scale, a modified variant of the Kardashev scale created by British physicist John\n\nText continuation:\nD. Barrow, which is intended to categorize the development stage of extraterrestrial civilizations, it would be conceivable that advanced civilizations do not claim more and more space and resources, but optimize their already available space increasingly, for example by building a matrioshka brain consisting of several layers of computronium around their star.\nIn the 2010 film The Singularity Is Near: A True Story About the Future, American futurist Ray Kurzweil discusses a universe filled with computronium. He believes this could be possible as early as the late 22nd century and would be accomplished by sending intelligent nanobots through the universe faster than light, e.g. by using wormholes. According to him, such an endeavor would have the potential to prevent the natural ending of the universe.\nIn addition, the term computronium is used in connection with science fiction narratives.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The train, inaugurated in 1946, originally ran from Cincinnati, Ohio, to New Orleans, Louisiana, via Louisville, Nashville, Birmingham, Montgomery and Mobile and later via a connection at Bowling Green, Kentucky, to Memphis, Tennessee. A connection to Chicago was provided by the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad.\nThe Humming Bird had separate sections in the north and the south. The main northern part originated in Cincinnati; other sections (of the L&N's Georgian) originated in St. Louis and from Chicago. These sections linked with the main part of the train in Nashville. At Bowling Green, Kentucky, a southwest-bound section broke off, bound for Memphis; whereas the main southern route continued south to\n\nText continuation:\nMobile, Alabama, where it connected with the Gulf Coast Limited, a train operated by the Illinois Central Railroad.\nThe Humming Bird was known for its luxurious accommodations, including sleeping cars, dining cars, and observation cars. The train featured a distinctive silver and blue color scheme, with a logo featuring a hummingbird, which was a symbol of the railroad. The train was also famous for its on-board amenities, including fine dining, entertainment, and comfortable sleeping quarters.\nAs the years went by, the Humming Bird continued to operate, with occasional changes to its route and schedule. In the 1960s, the train was modified to include air-conditioned cars, and in the 1970s, it was upgraded to include diesel locomotives. Despite these changes, the Humming Bird remained a popular choice for travelers, particularly those looking for a comfortable and convenient way to travel between the Midwest and the Gulf Coast.\nIn the 1980s, the Humming Bird was merged with other trains operated by the L&N, and it was eventually discontinued in the 1990s. However, its legacy lives on, with many railroad enthusiasts still fondly remembering the train's luxurious accommodations and scenic route. Today, the Humming Bird is remembered as a symbol of the golden age of American rail travel, a time when trains were the primary mode of transportation and the railroad was a vital part of the country's infrastructure.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Train 6 was the northbound number.\nThe original equipment was part of a 28-car order of four train sets of lightweight stainless steel cars built in 1946 by ACF. Fourteen cars were assigned to the Humming Bird and fourteen to the Georgian. Many of those cars were removed from service in the late 1960s due to severe corrosion problems.\nThe L&N Railroad served the old Union Station in Memphis, until its closure on April 1, 1964. The railroad then used Central Station. Both L&N and Southern Railway were forced to reopen part of Union Station on December 1, 1966, and use it until March 30, 1968.\nThe Humming Bird was canceled on January 9, 1969. At that time, the L&N Railroad earned some unwanted publicity when it terminated the final run of the train en route southbound at Birmingham when a federal judge lifted the order keeping the train running after the Interstate Commerce Commission approved its permanent discontinuance. The passengers were then bused to their destinations.\nThe train inspired the song \"Hummingbird\" by country artist Ricky Skaggs and was mentioned in the song \"Southern Rains\" by country artist Mel Tillis.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Singapore Airlines was the first carrier in the world to operate the double-decker aircraft. No-one was injured in the incident involving the world's biggest airliner, a Singapore Airlines spokesman said, but passengers were taken off so the plane could be repositioned and inspected for any damage. A truck being used to push back the plane in preparation for the flight \"experienced some form of failure\" causing it disconnect from the aircraft, a Singapore Airlines spokesman said. \"As a consequence of the failure on the truck, the aircraft ... came into contact with the grass verge off the airport tarmac. The aircraft was not under its own power at the time,\" he said. \"It is too early at this time to know the cause of the incident but Singapore Airlines will investigate this quickly, and is filing reports with the appropriate Singapore authorities,\" the spokesman said. An airline spokesman told CNN's Richard Quest that four wheels had ended up on the grass.  All four tires had now been replaced.  \"As far as Singapore Airlilnes is concerned, the plane is ready to fly again,\" Quest said. The airline made arrangements for as many customers as possible to continue on their journey from Changi Airport to Sydney aboard a Boeing 747-400. Most passengers departed for Sydney on a new flight early Friday morning, while some others flew to alternate destinations such as Melbourne and Brisbane on existing flights. \"The remaining customers, about 10 of them, have left, or will be leaving, for Sydney today,\" the spokesman said. Singapore Airlines received its first A380 in October last year to become the first carrier in the world to operate the double-decker aircraft, which it is currently using for the Singapore-Sydney route. Changi Airport, which is home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, has declared itself ready to handle the plane.

Singapore Airlines was the first carrier in the world to operate the double-decker aircraft. No-one was injured in the incident involving the world's biggest airliner, a Singapore Airlines spokesman said, but passengers were taken off so the plane could be repositioned and inspected for any damage. A truck being used to push back the plane in preparation for the flight \"experienced some form of failure\" causing it disconnect from the aircraft, a Singapore Airlines spokesman said. \"As a consequence of the failure on the truck, the aircraft ... came into contact with the grass verge off the airport tarmac. The aircraft was not under its own power at the time,\" he said. \"It is too early at this time to know the cause of the incident but Singapore Airlines will investigate this quickly, and is filing reports with the appropriate Singapore authorities,\" the spokesman said. An airline spokesman told CNN's Richard Quest that four wheels had ended up on the grass.  All four tires had now been replaced.  \"As far as Singapore Airlilnes is concerned, the plane is ready to fly again,\" Quest said. The airline made arrangements for as many customers as possible to continue on their journey from Changi Airport to Sydney aboard a Boeing 747-400. Most passengers departed for Sydney on a new flight early Friday morning, while some others flew to alternate destinations such as Melbourne and Brisbane on existing flights. \"The remaining customers, about 10 of them, have left, or will be leaving, for Sydney today,\" the spokesman said. Singapore Airlines received its first A380 in October last year to become the first carrier in the world to operate the double-decker aircraft, which it is currently using for the Singapore-Sydney route. Changi Airport, which is home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, has declared itself ready to handle the plane. It widened and lengthened existing runways and widened runway shoulders to allow the plane to maneuver. Airports around the world have had to make changes to accommodate the A380, such as enlarging runways and gates and bringing in vehicles which can tow the plane and lift high enough to reach its upper decks.

I was at a food and wine festival in Paris last year and discovered Grangers at a small boutique stand. The owner, Monsieur Granger, was there personally and introduced me to his entire range. I was blown away by the complexity and depth of flavors in each piece. I knew right then and there that I had to bring his chocolates to the US market.\nUser 2: That sounds like a fantastic experience. What kind of flavors do they offer?\nUser 1: Ah, that's the best part! Grangers has a range of unique and exotic flavors, like lavender and honey, champagne and strawberry, and even a truffle and orange combination. They also have some more traditional flavors like dark chocolate and sea salt, but with a twist. For example, their dark chocolate has a hint of smokiness from the cocoa beans being smoked over oak wood.\nUser 2: Wow, that does sound impressive. How do you plan to market these chocolates to your customers?\nUser 1: Well, I was thinking of partnering with your restaurant to offer a special promotion. We could create a customized chocolate tasting menu that pairs perfectly with your wine list. I also have some ideas for packaging and branding that would really make the chocolates stand out on your tables and in your gift shop. What do you think?

Relatively few people have taken this form of inference, based on high probability, to serve as a foundation for non-monotonic logic or for a logical or defeasible inference. There are exceptions: Jane Nutter [16] thinks that sometimes probability has something to do with non-monotonic reasoning. Judea Pearl [ 17] has recently\n\nText continuation:\nargued that probabilistic inference can be used to model defeasible reasoning, and has proposed a formal system for doing so. This is an important contribution, as it shows that probabilistic inference can be used to reason about uncertain information in a way that is both logically sound and computationally tractable.\nIn addition to these exceptions, there are also some researchers who have explored the connection between probabilistic inference and non-monotonic logic more broadly. For example, [18] has shown that probabilistic inference can be used to model non-monotonic reasoning in the context of default logic, while [19] has used probabilistic inference to model non-monotonic reasoning in the context of circumscription. These results suggest that probabilistic inference may be a useful tool for reasoning about uncertain information in a wide range of contexts, and may be particularly useful in situations where the evidence is incomplete or uncertain.\nOne of the key challenges in using probabilistic inference to reason about uncertain information is dealing with the problem of uncertainty itself. In many cases, the evidence is incomplete or uncertain, and it is difficult to determine the probability of a given event or proposition. This is known as the problem of \"uncertainty propagation,\" and it is a major challenge in many areas of artificial intelligence and decision theory. However, there are also many researchers who are working on developing new methods and techniques for dealing with uncertainty, and who are exploring the potential applications of probabilistic inference in a wide range of fields.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "#"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

There are exceptions: Jane Nutter [16] thinks that sometimes probability has something to do with non-monotonic reasoning. Judea Pearl [ 17] has recently\n\nText continuation:\nbeen exploring the possibility. There are any number of people whom one might call probability enthusiasts who feel that probability provides all the answers by itself, with no need of help from logic. Cheeseman [1], Henrion [5] and others think it useful to look at a distribution of probabilities over a whole algebra of statements, to update that distribution in the light of new evidence, and to use the latest updated distribution of probability over the algebra as a basis for planning and decision making. A slightly weaker form of this approach is captured by Nilsson [15], where one assumes certain probabilities for certain statements, and infers the probabilities, or constraints on the probabilities of other statement. None of this corresponds to what I call probabilistic inference. All of the inference that is taking place, either in Bayesian updating, or in probabilistic logic, is strictly deductive. Deductive inference, particularly that concerned with the distribution of classical probabilities or chances, is of great importance. But this is not to say that there is no important role for what earlier logicians have called \"ampliative\" or \"inductive\" or \"scientific\" inference, in which the conclusion goes beyond the premises, asserts more than do the premises.

The use of computational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single ventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of pacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the biomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing in clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In practice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each other's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD) the main steps involved in performing\n\nText continuation:\ncomputational simulations.\nThe first step is to define the problem and identify the specific clinical question being addressed. This requires a thorough understanding of the patient's anatomy and physiology, as well as the relevant clinical data. Next, the computational model is developed, which involves creating a digital representation of the patient's heart and blood vessels. This is typically done using specialized software and involves a range of techniques, including finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics.\nOnce the model is developed, it can be used to simulate various scenarios and predict the outcomes of different treatments. This allows clinicians to test different approaches and make informed decisions about the best course of action. The simulations can also be used to identify potential complications and develop strategies for mitigating them.\nIn addition to its clinical applications, computational simulation can also be used to advance our understanding of the underlying biology of congenital heart disease. For example, simulations can be used to study the effects of genetic mutations on heart development and function, or to investigate the role of environmental factors in the development of CHD.\nOverall, the use of computational simulation in the study of congenital heart disease has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach diagnosis and treatment. By providing a powerful tool for predicting outcomes and identifying potential complications, simulations can help clinicians make more informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "respond", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

We examine the current state of the art and areas in need of continued development. For example, medical image-based model-building software has been developed based on numerous different methods. However, none of them can be used to construct a model with a simple \"click of a button\". The creation of a faithful, representative anatomic model, especially in pediatric subjects, often requires skilled manual intervention. In addition, information from a second imaging modality is often required to facilitate this process. We describe the technical aspects of model building, provide a definition of some of the most commonly used terms and techniques (e.g. meshes, mesh convergence, Navier-Stokes equations, and boundary conditions), and the assumptions used in running the simulations. Particular attention is paid to the assignment of boundary conditions as this point is of critical importance in the current areas of research within the realm of congenital heart disease. Finally, examples are provided demonstrating how computer simulations can provide an opportunity to \"acquire\" data currently unobtainable by other modalities, with essentially no risk to patients. To illustrate these points, novel simulation examples of virtual Fontan conversion (from preoperative data to predicted postoperative state) and outcomes of different surgical designs are presented. The need for validation of the currently employed techniques and predicted results are required and the methods remain in their infancy. While the daily application of these technologies to patient-specific clinical scenarios likely remains years away, the ever increasing interest in this area among both clinicians and engineers makes its eventual use far more likely than ever before and, some could argue, only a matter of [computing] time.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "To", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Protesters demonstrate against an anti-Islamic film in front of the Dutch embassy in Jakarta. The protesters tore off the gate of the embassy in the city of Medan and ripped down a flag, said Dutch Embassy spokeswoman Gonneke de Ridder. Local television carried pictures of police dispersing and rounding up demonstrators. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim nation. The 15-minute film, \"Fitna,\" features disturbing images of terrorist acts juxtaposed over verses from the Quran to paint Islam as a threat to Western society. It has been posted on several Web sites, including Google Video and YouTube. Dutch Prime Minister Jan Beter Balkanende has said his government worried that Geert Wilders' film could provoke a violent backlash. The film has prompted protests in other parts of the Muslim world. Soon after its release last month, hundreds of angry Muslims rallied in Pakistan, where the government temporarily blocked access of YouTube over a trailer for Wilders' film. The protesters burned the Dutch flag and called on Pakistan to cut ties with the Netherlands. The Dutch government and others, including the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, have rejected the film. The OIC has 57 member states over four continents and claims on its Web site to be the second largest inter-governmental organization, after the United Nations. In its statement, it urged the international community to condemn the showing of the film and asked the Dutch government to prosecute the author of the documentary under Dutch law. Wilders has stood by his project. \"My intention was not to offend in any way, but to show the truth -- at least the truth as I see it,\" Wilders told CNN. \"And if the truth hurts and could be offensive, well, this of course is not my problem.\" Wilders is a member of the Dutch parliament from the conservative Party for Freedom and an outspoken critic of Islam. He said he has \"big problems\" with Islam's Prophet Mohammed, the Quran and \"everything that is stated inside this terrible book.\" The title, \"Fitna,\" translates in Arabic to \"strife\" or \"conflict\" of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group. The film opens with passages from the Quran, interspersed with graphic images of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States . The video also includes disturbing images of other terror attacks -- bloodied victims; beheadings of hostages; executions of women in hijab, the traditional Muslim attire; and footage, with subtitles, of Islamic leaders preaching inflammatory sermons against Jews and Christians.

Therefore, it is possible to create High Resolution (HR) Digital Elevation Models (DEM) incorporating thin above ground elements influencing overland flow paths. Even though this category of big data has a high level of accuracy, there are still errors in measurements and hypothesis under DEM elaboration. Moreover, operators look for optimizing spatial discretization resolution in order to improve flood models computation time. Errors in measurement, errors in DEM generation, and operator choices for inclusion of this data within 2D hydraulic model, might influence results of flood models simulations. These errors and hypothesis may influence significantly flood\n\nText continuation:\nrisk assessments and mitigation strategies.\nTo address these challenges, researchers have been exploring advanced methods for error reduction and DEM refinement. For instance, the use of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology has been shown to provide highly accurate topographic data, even in complex urban environments. Additionally, the integration of multiple data sources, such as aerial imagery and ground-based sensors, can help to reduce errors and improve the overall accuracy of DEMs.\nFurthermore, the development of advanced computational methods and algorithms has enabled the creation of more sophisticated flood models that can better account for the complexities of overland flow and the influence of above-ground elements. These models can be used to simulate a wide range of flood scenarios, from small-scale flash floods to large-scale riverine floods, and can provide valuable insights into the behavior of floodwaters and the potential impacts of different flood mitigation strategies.\nDespite these advances, there is still much work to be done to fully understand the complexities of flood modeling and to develop more accurate and reliable flood risk assessments. Ongoing research is focused on addressing the challenges of DEM generation and refinement, as well as the development of more advanced computational methods and algorithms for flood modeling. By continuing to push the boundaries of what is possible with aerial photogrammetry and other technologies, researchers and practitioners can work together to improve our understanding of flood risk and to develop more effective strategies for mitigating the impacts of flood events.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "to", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Therefore, it is possible to create High Resolution (HR) Digital Elevation Models (DEM) incorporating thin above ground elements influencing overland flow paths. Even though this category of big data has a high level of accuracy, there are still errors in measurements and hypothesis under DEM elaboration. Moreover, operators look for optimizing spatial discretization resolution in order to improve flood models computation time. Errors in measurement, errors in DEM generation, and operator choices for inclusion of this data within 2D hydraulic model, might influence results of flood models simulations. These errors and hypothesis may influence significantly flood\n\nText continuation:\nmodelling results variability. The purpose of this study is to investigate uncertainties related to (i) the own error of high resolution topographic data, and (ii) the modeller choices when including topographic data in hydraulic codes. The aim is to perform a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) which goes through a Monte-Carlo uncertainty propagation, to quantify impact of uncertainties, followed by a Sobol' indices computation, to rank influence of identified parameters on result variability. A process using a coupling of an environment for parametric computation (Prom{\\'e}th{\\'e}e) and a code relying on 2D shallow water equations (FullSWOF 2D) has been developed (P-FS tool). The study has been performed over the lower part of the Var river valley using the estimated hydrograph of 1994 flood event. HR topographic data has been made available for the study area, which is 17.5 km 2 , by Nice municipality. Three uncertain parameters were studied: the measurement error (var. E), the level of details of above-ground element representation in DEM (buildings, sidewalks, etc.) (var. S), and the spatial discretization resolution (grid cell size for regular mesh) (var. R). Parameter var. E follows a probability density function, whereas parameters var. S and var. R. are discrete operator choices. Combining these parameters, a database of 2, 000 simulations has been produced using P-FS tool implemented on a high performance computing structure.

It has been shown that while keeping weekly volume the same, if you trained more frequently (e.g daily, instead of 3/week) strength gains were slightly higher and muscle gain was noticeably higher.\nsays nothing about it more taxing on recovery\n-RandomPoem-: you're ignoring the rest of that write up, and just focusing on the benefits of greasing the groove rather than what might be the most effective style of workout\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "You", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "You", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Conversely, we prove that holomorphic nondegeneracy is necessary for this property of CR mappings to hold. For the case of unequal dimensions, we also prove that if $M$ is an algebraic hypersurface in $ C^N$ which does not contain any complex variety of positive codimension and $M'$ is the sphere in $ C^{N+1 }$ , then extendability holds for all CR mappings with certain minimal a priori regularity. Theorem A. Let $M$ and $M'$ be two algebraic hypersurfaces in $C^N$ and assume that $M$ is connected and holomorphically\n\nText continuation:\nnondegenerate. Then any CR mapping $F$ from $M$ to $M'$ with Jacobian not identically zero can be extended to a holomorphic mapping from a neighborhood of $M$ to $M'$.\nWe will now provide a proof of this theorem. Let $F$ be a CR mapping from $M$ to $M'$ with Jacobian not identically zero. Since $M$ is connected and holomorphically nondegenerate, we can choose a point $p$ on $M$ such that the tangent space to $M$ at $p$ is not contained in any complex variety of positive codimension. Let $V$ be the complex variety of positive codimension in $C^N$ that contains the tangent space to $M$ at $p$. Then $V$ is a proper closed complex subvariety of $C^N$ that contains $M$.\nLet $U$ be a neighborhood of $M$ in $C^N$ such that $U$ does not intersect $V$ and $F$ is defined on $U$. Since $F$ is a CR mapping, we can write $F$ in the form $F(z)=\\left(f_1(z),\\ldots,f_N(z)\\right)$, where $f_1,\\ldots,f_N$ are real-valued functions on $U$ that satisfy the CR equations $\\overline{\\partial}f_j=0$ for $j=1,\\ldots,N$. Since $F$ is holomorphically nondegenerate, we can choose a point $q$ on $M$ such that the Jacobian matrix of $F$ at $q$ has rank $N$.\nLet $W$ be a neighborhood of $q$ in $U$ such that the Jacobian matrix of $F$ is invertible on $W$. Then $F$ is a diffeomorphism from $W$ to $F(W)$. Since $F(W)$ is a neighborhood of $F(q)$ in $M'$, we can choose a point $r$ on $M'$ such that $F(q)$ is in the connected component of $M'$ that contains $r$.

Conversely, we prove that holomorphic nondegeneracy is necessary for this property of CR mappings to hold. For the case of unequal dimensions, we also prove that if $M$ is an algebraic hypersurface in $ C^N$ which does not contain any complex variety of positive codimension and $M'$ is the sphere in $ C^{N+1 }$ , then extendability holds for all CR mappings with certain minimal a priori regularity. Theorem A. Let $M$ and $M'$ be two algebraic hypersurfaces in $C^N$ and assume that $M$ is connected and holomorphically\n\nText continuation:\nnondegenerate. If $H$ is a smooth CR mapping from $M$ to $M'$ with $ Jac H \\not\\equiv 0$, where $Jac H$ is the Jacobian determinant of $H$, then $H$ extends holomorphically in an open neighborhood of $M$ in $ C^N$. A recent example given by Ebenfelt shows that the conclusion of Theorem A need not hold if $M$ is real analytic, but not algebraic. Theorem B. Let $M$ be a connected real analytic hypersurface in $C^N$ which is holomorphically degenerate at some point $p_1$. Let $p_0 \\in M$ and suppose there exists a germ at $p_0$ of a smooth CR function on $M$ which does not extend holomorphically to any full neighborhood of $p_0$ in $C^N$. Then there exists a germ at $p_0$ of a smooth CR diffeomorphism from $M$ into itself, fixing $p_0$, which does not extend holomorphically to any neighborhood of $p_0$ in $C^N$. Theorem C. Let $M\\subset C^N$ be an algebraic hypersurface. Assume that there is no nontrivial complex analytic variety contained in $M$ through $p_0 \\in M$, and let $m=m_{p_0}$ be the D'Angelo type. If $H: M \\to S^{2N+1}\\subset C^{N+1}$ is a CR map of class $C^m$, where $S^{2N+1}$ denotes the boundary of the unit ball in $C^{N+1 }$, then $H$ admits a holomorphic extension in a neighborhood of $p_0$.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "&", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

But for Loedkane, the struggle was far from over. Despite the outpouring of support, the harsh reality of living on a disability income and food stamps remained. The constant struggle to make ends meet, the feeling of being trapped in a never-ending cycle of poverty, was suffocating.\nLoedkane's words echoed through the digital void, a cry for help from someone who felt like they were drowning in a sea of uncertainty. The comments section was filled with well-meaning advice and words of encouragement, but for Loedkane, it was just noise. They didn't need platitudes or empty promises; they needed tangible solutions.\nAs Loedkane scrolled through the comments, they couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration. Why did it take a viral letter to Santa to spark a response? Why did it take a child's plea for help to bring attention to the struggles of those living on the margins? The system was broken, and Loedkane was tired of being a statistic.\nBut amidst the chaos of the online comments, Loedkane found a glimmer of hope. A small group of commenters, who had been quietly offering words of encouragement and support, stood out from the rest. They didn't offer easy answers or empty promises; they simply listened. They acknowledged the pain and the struggle, and they offered a sense of solidarity.\nFor Loedkane, this small group of strangers became a lifeline. They became a reminder that they were not alone, that there were others out there who understood the struggle. And as Loedkane continued to vent and share their story, they began to feel a sense of empowerment. They realized that their voice mattered, that their story had the power to spark change.\nAs the days went by, Loedkane's post continued to spread, reaching a wider audience and sparking a national conversation about poverty and disability. The girl's letter to Santa had started a movement, and Loedkane was at the forefront. They were no longer just a statistic; they were a voice, a face, a reminder that the struggle was real.\nAnd as Loedkane looked out at the sea of blankets and donations, they knew that they were not alone. They knew that there were others out there who understood the struggle, who were fighting for a better life. And they knew that together, they could make a difference.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Shut up and eat your carbs, disabled people!\" \nblh1003: I don't see you volunteering to pay higher taxes\nMarshmallowTurtle: Okay, I volunteer? Other developed countries seem to be doing just fine providing social safety nets through taxes. If we used the money for less expensive health care and education, I would be benefiting myself as well anyway.\nblh1003: You can withhold more on your check if you desire, maybe if you pitched in we can solve this problem \nMarshmallowTurtle: I would absolutely be willing to do so if I knew I wasn't one of the few doing it. That's like telling me to go get a bucket of water during a wildfire while I'm requesting fire department assistance and also my house is burning too.\nI already donate to charities and have done a couple giving tree requests while working a minimum wage job, paying for prescriptions out of pocket, and saving for college so the next semester I'm able to attend I don't have to completely rely on loans. Stop projecting your unwillingness to help on strangers. People are doing their best to help.\nBefore this gets heated, I invite you to read rule number one of this subreddit. I will not be participating in an argument over whether sick people deserve vegetables or not.\nblh1003: Say that first sentence again and tell me how you don't sound like one of the people against universal college and healthcare\nMarshmallowTurtle: I have no idea how you're reaching that conclusion. If it worked like Canada or the UK or Denmark or France or Australia, I would be happy. That's what I'm saying. It does not, currently. Asking 1 person out of 300 million to \"pitch in\" and then telling them they're actually against universal healthcare because they think the extra 20 bucks out of their pay check won't help much is ridiculous. I would gladly pay if it got people those things. It does not.\nblh1003: Thank you for proving my point \nMarshmallowTurtle: I think it should work that way. That was *my* point. \nblh1003: You didn't make it very well\nMarshmallowTurtle: I think you either lack reading comprehension skills, or you need another cup of coffee. This whole conversation in a nutshell:\n1. Your downvoted comment suggests people should just be happy with what assistance they get. \n2. I suggested it could be better \n3. You said I should help\n4. I told you I do, as much as possible, but can't singularly pay for the entire US population's healthcare and government assistance programs\n5. This makes me against universal healthcare?\n6. I restate my point\n7. You... now agree with me, I guess.\nI hope your day gets better.\nblh1003: You need to articulate better\nMarshmallowTurtle: *Ugh.*\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "You", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "You", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "You", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

But she wasn't looking for the perfect safari lodge. She was hunting for the right cosmetic surgeon. When she told her family, it wasn't an easy sell. \"South Africa? You're going to get some kind of witch doctor,\" she recalls her father saying. \"But I told him they perfected some of the first heart surgeries down there. To me, South Africa had the most reputable surgeons.\" Hiltbrunner, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, traveled to Johannesburg in 2004 for a face-lift, upper arm lift and eyelid surgery. And she and her husband -- who hadn't taken a vacation in 20 years -- went on a luxury safari, included in the package by medical-travel agency Surgeon and Safari. \"Medical tourism\" may sound strange, but patients are discovering they can get some cosmetic surgeries abroad for less than the U.S. price. And many surgeries include sightseeing packages. The roster of countries in which hospitals and surgeons are marketing their services to foreigners is growing. South Africa, Argentina, Thailand, Brazil, Costa Rica, India and Singapore have become major players. Robert Painter, a travel writer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, journeyed last year to Argentina for dental surgeries -- and tango lessons: \"If I'm going to be stuck somewhere for two weeks at a time, twice, Buenos Aires has got to be the best possible place,\" he says . Painter's procedures were organized by Plenitas, a medical-travel facilitator in Buenos Aires, which booked him at a hotel with a dance studio in the back. He wasn't the only guest getting surgery: \"While I was there, there was a young lady who was also having implants -- though not of the dental type.\" Cost-cutting pros and cons . Cosmetic, or elective, procedures aren't covered by insurance, so cost remains the motivating factor for most medical tourists. Surgeries in many countries cost half or even one-fifth what they would in the U.S. -- including airfare, hotel and excursions. \"A full face-lift that would cost $20,000 in the U.S. runs about $1,250 in South Africa,\" a 2005 article in U-Daily, the University of Delaware's online news service noted. Faith Richter, of Hope Sound, Florida, got a face-lift in Bangkok, Thailand. Her trip was organized by New York City's Med Journeys. \"In the U.S., it would have cost $20,000 for the procedure alone, with no time in the hospital,\" she says. In Bangkok, Richter was in the hospital four days, and the total cost of her 19-day trip, including sightseeing and airfare for two, was $10,600. Painter estimates he saved $18,000 on his surgeries. \"Cost was the primary factor,\" he says. \"The only factor.\" Medical costs abroad are less than in the U.S. for many reasons -- favorable exchange rates, lower salaries and fewer medical lawsuits, which means lower malpractice-insurance costs. But the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery warns against low-cost surgery. \"Get bargains on your shoes and laundry detergent, not on your face,\" says spokesman Tony Staffieri. \"Researching the quality of doctors should be a patient's primary consideration, but it isn't always,\" he says. \"Some people think 'tummy tuck and shopping.' This is not makeup; it's somebody cutting you.\" Some medical professionals fear that patients will overlook the severity of invasive surgeries and fail to ask the right questions. More casual attitudes toward plastic surgery -- spurred by lunch-break Botox treatments and same-day liposuctions, paired with temptingly cheap alternatives and vacation packages -- increase the risk of bad outcomes. Even stateside, cosmetic surgery can have tragic results. \"First Wives Club\" author Olivia Goldsmith died during a chin-tuck in 2004, and this year Kanye West's mother, Donda, died after a tummy tuck and breast reduction. However, a 2004 study published in the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, found that \"deaths occurring at office-based surgery facilities (in the U.S.) are rare -- less than a quarter of a percent.\" Quality surgeons . Medical tourism experts counter criticism by saying that cheaper prices don't necessarily mean lower quality of care. \"In general, it is the hospitals and facilities that have justifiable claim to 'world-class' status or to meeting or exceeding U.S. standards that are competing for patients from the United States and other countries,\" says Jeff Schult, author of \"Beauty from Afar: A Medical Tourist's Guide to Affordable and Quality Cosmetic Care Outside the U.S.\" The authors of a 2006 \"New England Journal of Medicine\" article confirm the high standards of internationally accredited hospitals: \"We doubt (...) that the average U.S. hospital can offer better outcomes for common complex operations.\" \"Almost 80 percent of the doctors we use have been trained in the U.S. or U.K.,\" says Tim Wallace, vice president of sales and marketing for Med Journeys. \"It gives the American consumer a degree of confidence.\" Richter, a registered nurse, agrees that standards are high abroad. \"After the surgery, the nurses were there for me 100 percent,\" she says. \"At home, we're so understaffed and overburdened, and inundated with paperwork.\" When Painter visited U.S. dentists, \"I felt like I was being processed for a home loan,\" he says. \"In Argentina, I had three dentists working on me at once.\" While medical tourism continues to increase in popularity, it's still not mainstream.

Ex: /u/&lt;username&gt;.\n/u/vaughannt asked: \n&gt;I'm trying to work up to the arch hold. Currently just doing the leg lift portion for 30 seconds. Should I be feeling muscle activation in my core? It seems like I only feel it in my legs. I was feeling it in my lower back momentarily but I think I've corrected that. Anyone have tips?\nstickysweetastytreat: u/vaughannt\nYeah feeling it in your legs is fine, like along your butt &amp; backs of your thighs. For low back, there are two ways you can do it-- by moving your low back with it, or not. If you want to keep it out of your low back, then tuck your tailbone while you lift your legs solely with your butt + legs. Don't expect to lift your legs very high this way, but you do put more work on your butt/legs. Instead of thinking \"tuck your tailbone\", you could also think of it like trying to draw your navel up away from the floor while you lift your legs.\nIf your low back isn't irritated by it, there's no inherent harm in moving with your low back. You could even try both ways!\nvaughannt: Awesome, thank you for the reply!\nstickysweetastytreat: Yw, good luck!\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "**"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Both", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Y", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease\n\nText continuation:\ntypically display characteristic features such as ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and interstitial patterns, which are difficult to distinguish from other lung diseases. To address this challenge, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the images as either COVID-19 positive or negative. Our model is trained using a combination of transfer learning and fine-tuning, allowing it to learn from the pre-trained weights and adapt to the specific characteristics of the COVID-19 dataset. We evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and compare it to other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our model achieves a high level of accuracy and robustness, outperforming other methods in detecting COVID-19 patients from chest radiography images. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models in aiding the diagnosis of COVID-19, and highlights the importance of developing accurate and reliable diagnostic tools to combat this global health crisis.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Respond", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease\n\nText continuation:\npresence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% ($\\pm$ 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates. The dataset, model implementations (in PyTorch), and evaluations, are all made publicly available for research community at https://github.com/shervinmin/DeepCovid.git\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Min", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Sh", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Min", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Sh", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Min", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Min", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I was blinded by the prospect of saving money. Now I'm out twenty bucks and I don't even have a working camera to show for it.\nUser 2: Well, at least you learned a valuable lesson.

I thought it was a new camera. We could use it. We were even thinking about buying a camera. I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box.\nUser 2: That's no problem. He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap. That's easy. And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from. Maybe his friend works in an electronics store. They sell video cameras there. Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around. So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you. Twenty dollars a brick. That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks.\nUser 1: You're right, Sarah. I was a fool. I can't believe it.

It was a great experience, as it taught me the importance of communication and collaboration in achieving a common goal.\"\nThe interviewer smiled, seeming to approve of my answer. \"Excellent,\" they said. \"Now, I'd like to ask you a few scenario-based questions.

Conrad Smith touches down for one of his two tries in the All Blacks win. Fullback Mils Muliaina scored three tries in the first half, center Conrad Smith and winger Richard Kahui touched down twice and nine other players added their names to the New Zealand scoresheet as the All Blacks beat a weakened Samoan team by a record margin. New Zealand led 47-7, seven tries to one, at halftime and added eight tries, including a penalty try, in the second spell to surpass their highest score against Samoa. The All Blacks had a 26-0 lead after 16 minutes and set their record score against Samoa -- surpassing the 71-13 in 1999 -- despite being held scoreless for periods of 18 minutes in the first half and 10 minutes in the second. It was the fifth time New Zealand had reached 100 points in a match, with the All Blacks' record being the 145-17 win over Japan at the 1995 World Cup. Samoa was forced to pick a severely under-strength side because many of its leading and most-experienced players are involved with European club sides. Most of the players who took the field Wednesday were young and Samoa-based and playing against the All Blacks for the first time. Although outgunned by an All Blacks team which overwhelmingly controlled territory and possession, Samoa played with great spirit and scored a try in each half. Flyhalf Uale Mai scored and converted his own try after 28 minutes and flanker Alafoti Faosiliva touched down off a break by Uale Mai four minutes before fulltime. \"What can you say? 100 points,\" Samoa captain Filipo Levi said. \"It shows the All Blacks are on fire at the moment. They've showed in the Tri-Nations competition that they're a very consistent team. \"For some of our boys it was a big step up from playing club rugby in Samoa but, having said that, it was a big learning curve.\" Flyhalf Daniel Carter converted six of the All Blacks' first-half tries, surpassing 2,000 points in first-class rugby, and his replacement Stephen Donald scored his first Test try and converted seven of New Zealand's eight second-half tries. The match was scheduled to help the All Blacks bridge the three-week gap between their most recent Tri-Nations clash with South Africa and their next, against Australia, at Brisbane on September 13. The Brisbane match will decide the outcome of the Tri-Nations tournament. Copyright 2008 CNN. All rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Yes I do use the typical glasses cleaner with cloth wipe...\ncrhaxter: Optician here. The best way to clean them is with regular isopropyl alcohol. Try to keep it mostly on the lenses as it is a solvent and can discolor certain plastic frames. Use only a cotton or microfiber cloth, no paper towels. Dish soap can work too. After the initial cleaning, a new microfiber cloth should keep them streak free for awhile.\nEDIT: I like to use two cloths. One for cleaning with alcohol then let lenses dry, then use a clean one to remove all residue\n\nText continuation:\nIt's great to hear that you're taking the time to clean your glasses regularly, TaylorHammond9. However, it's understandable that you're frustrated with the smears left behind. I completely agree with crhaxter's advice on using isopropyl alcohol and microfiber cloths. The key is to be gentle and avoid using too much liquid, as this can cause streaks and residue.\nIn addition to crhaxter's method, I would also recommend using a soft, dry cloth to wipe down the frames and temples after cleaning the lenses. This will help remove any dirt or debris that may have accumulated on the frame.\nAnother trick I've found helpful is to use a lens cleaning solution specifically designed for glasses. These solutions are usually ammonia-free and won't leave any streaks or residue. You can find them at most optical stores or online.\nIt's also important to note that some glasses cleaners can leave a residue on the lenses, which can attract dirt and dust. If you're using a cleaner that leaves a residue, try switching to a different brand or type of cleaner.\nIn your case, TaylorHammond9, since you only use your glasses at night, you may want to consider using a lens cleaning solution specifically designed for night use. These solutions are usually gentler and won't leave any streaks or residue.\nTo further minimize smears and streaks, I would recommend cleaning your glasses in a circular motion, starting from the center of the lens and working your way outwards. This will help prevent any dirt or debris from being pushed around and causing streaks.\nFinally, it's always a good idea to clean your glasses in a well-lit area, so you can see any streaks or smears as you clean. This will help you catch any imperfections and ensure that your glasses are clean and streak-free.\nBy following these tips and using the right cleaning solutions and cloths, you should be able to keep your glasses clean and streak-free. Remember to be patient and gentle when cleaning your glasses, and don't be afraid to experiment with different methods until you find what works best for you.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "To", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Before ordering the coating, decide if you are rough with glasses and if the coating will be worth getting. There is also a cosmetic component to the coating, it makes the lens less visible and brightens your under-eye area.\nGrouchyMcSurly: Not an optician, but I'd disagree with that method, if I may... I have never needed to wipe glasses except in emergencies.\nMy standard method is to go to a tap and:\n* rinse them of dust on both sides under the water jet\n* take some liquid soap on fingertips, check there are no abrasive inclusions by rubbing it around a second. Avoid dishwasher liquid as it's too concentrated. If you can dilute (moisten) the soap with a bit of water, that's even better.\n* wash the lenses gently on both sides with fingertips\n* rinse them out.\n* turn the lenses edge-first to the water-jet and 'scan' with them through from one side to the other, taking away almost all drops from the lens surfaces. Make sure the jet is not aerated (white water) when doing this because that leaves behind tiny droplets from bubble bursts. Just turn down the water intensity to prevent aeration, if needed.\n\n* blow away any remaining drops\n* wipe the bottom of the rim (not the lens!) on trousers, taking away dangling droplets.\nSounds long, but it takes less than 30 seconds, leaves the lenses in perfect condition and nothing except water and soapy fingertips ever touched them. I've been doing this for more than 12 years, and never had a scratch. It *needs* coated leanses however -- on glass the droplets adhere too much.\n109614991: You are brilliant, this is all.\nGrouchyMcSurly: Thank you!\nHow did you come across this comment one month after it was posted?

However, other branches of artificial intelligence have designed crucial ingredients towards autonomous learning: curiosity and intrinsic motivation, social learning and natural interaction with peers, and embodiment. These mechanisms guide exploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep learning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made great advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human learning. As argued convincingly by Lake et al., differences include human capabilities to learn causal models of the world from very little data, leveraging compositional representations and\n\nText continuation:\nhierarchical abstraction. Moreover, humans exhibit a remarkable ability to generalize and adapt to new situations, often relying on incomplete or noisy data.\nOne of the key challenges in developing autonomous lifelong learning systems is the ability to balance exploration and exploitation. Humans are able to strike a delicate balance between exploring new possibilities and exploiting what they already know, allowing them to adapt to changing environments and learn from experience. In contrast, current DL systems often struggle to balance these two competing goals, leading to a lack of adaptability and flexibility. To overcome this challenge, researchers are exploring new approaches that combine elements of curiosity-driven exploration with reinforcement learning, allowing agents to learn through trial and error while also adapting to new situations.\nAnother important consideration is the role of embodiment in autonomous learning. Humans learn and adapt through a combination of sensory input and motor output, allowing them to interact with the world in a meaningful way. In contrast, current DL systems are often limited to processing abstract representations of data, without the ability to interact with the physical world. To develop more human-like autonomous learning systems, researchers are exploring new approaches that integrate sensory-motor feedback with deep learning, allowing agents to learn through direct interaction with the environment.\nIn conclusion, autonomous lifelong development and learning is a complex and multifaceted capability that is still beyond the reach of current artificial intelligence systems. However, by combining elements of curiosity, social learning, and embodiment with deep learning, researchers are making progress towards developing more human-like autonomous learning systems. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, we may eventually develop systems that are capable of truly autonomous lifelong learning, with the potential to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, education, and beyond.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "#"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

However, there are other fundamental differences between current DL systems and human learning, as well as technical ingredients to fill this gap, that are either superficially, or not adequately, discussed by Lake et al. These fundamental mechanisms relate to autonomous development and learning. They are bound to play a central role in artificial intelligence in the future. Current DL systems require engineers to manually specify a task-specific objective function for every new task, and learn through off-line processing of large training databases. On the contrary, humans learn autonomously open-ended repertoires of skills, deciding for themselves which goals to pursue or value, and which skills to explore, driven by intrinsic motivation/curiosity and social learning through natural interaction with peers. Such learning processes are incremental, online, and progressive. Human child development involves a progressive increase of complexity in a curriculum of learning where skills are explored, acquired, and built on each other, through particular ordering and timing.

Originally ordered by the Khedivate of Egypt, an autonomous vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, the central Ottoman government forced Egypt to surrender Hifz-ur Rahman while she was still under construction at the French Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde shipyard. The vessel was a turret ship, armed with two 229 mm (9 in) Armstrong guns and two 178 mm (7 in) Armstrong guns, both pairs in revolving gun turrets.\nHifz-ur Rahman saw action during the Russo-Turkish War in 1877\u20131878, where she operated on the Danube to try to prevent Russian forces from crossing the river. While defending the port of Sulina, she engaged Russian gunboats in an inconclusive action.

Originally ordered by the Khedivate of Egypt, an autonomous vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, the central Ottoman government forced Egypt to surrender Hifz-ur Rahman while she was still under construction at the French Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde shipyard. The vessel was a turret ship, armed with two 229 mm (9 in) Armstrong guns and two 178 mm (7 in) Armstrong guns, both pairs in revolving gun turrets.\nHifz-ur Rahman saw action during the Russo-Turkish War in 1877\u20131878, where she operated on the Danube to try to prevent Russian forces from crossing the river. While defending the port of Sulina, she engaged Russian gunboats in an inconclusive action. She was laid up for twenty years, until the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, which highlighted the badly deteriorated state of the Ottoman fleet. A large-scale reconstruction program was put in place, and Hifz-ur Rahman was rebuilt in the Imperial Arsenal in the early 1890s. Nevertheless, she saw no further service of any significance, and she was sold for scrap in 1909.\n\nSummary:\nThe Hifz-ur Rahman was a big ship in the old days of the Ottoman empire. It had many powerful guns. It fought in wars against Russia and then later against the Greeks. Later in it's life it was restored but new saw battle again. Sadly, it was eventually scrapped.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "#"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The station's unique history and significance were reflected in its architecture, with a distinctive clock tower and ornate waiting rooms. Over the years, the station played host to numerous events, including the annual St. Leger festival, which drew visitors from all over the country.\nAs the years went by, the station continued to serve the Earl's parties and other special trains, but its usage gradually declined. By the mid-20th century, the station was largely abandoned, and its once-grand buildings fell into disrepair.

It appeared important to get a precise knowledge of these scan parameters' normal values during the first trimester. This paper focused on crown-rump length. --- METHODS --- 402 pregnancies from in-vitro fertilization allowing a precise estimation of foetal ages (FA) were used to determine the best model that describes crown-rump length (CRL) as a function of FA. Scan measures by a single operator from 3846 spontaneous pregnancies representative of the general population from Northern France were used to build a mathematical\n\nText continuation:\nmodel. The model was then validated using an independent dataset of 1000 pregnancies. The results showed that the best model was a polynomial function of degree three, which accurately described the relationship between CRL and FA.\nThe study found that the mean CRL at 11 weeks was 54.2 mm, increasing to 63.1 mm at 12 weeks and 72.4 mm at 13 weeks. The standard deviation of CRL at each gestational age was found to be 2.5 mm, 2.8 mm, and 3.1 mm, respectively. The model was also used to estimate the normal range of CRL for each gestational age, which was found to be between 49.4 mm and 59.3 mm at 11 weeks, 55.4 mm and 65.5 mm at 12 weeks, and 61.4 mm and 73.1 mm at 13 weeks.\nThe findings of this study are important for clinicians as they provide a precise knowledge of the normal range of CRL during the first trimester. This information can be used to improve the accuracy of foetal age estimation and to identify pregnancies at risk of Down's syndrome. The study also highlights the importance of using a single operator to perform the scans, as this can reduce the variability in the measurements and improve the accuracy of the results.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "respond", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

We modeled both CRL as a function of FA and FA as a function of CRL. For this, we used a clear methodology and performed regressions with heteroskedastic corrections and robust regressions. The results were compared by cross-validation to retain the equations with the best predictive power. We also studied the errors between observed and predicted values. --- Results --- Data from 513 spontaneous pregnancies allowed to model CRL as a function of age of foetal age. The best model was a polynomial of degree 2. Datation with our equation that models spontaneous pregnancies from a general population was in quite agreement with objective datations obtained from 402 IVF pregnancies and thus support the validity of our model. The most precise measure of CRL was when the SD was minimal (1.83mm), for a CRL of 23.6 mm where our model predicted a 49.4 days of foetal age. Our study allowed to model the SD from 30 to 90 days of foetal age and offers the opportunity of using Zscores in the future to detect growth abnormalities. --- Conclusion --- With powerful statistical tools we report a good modeling of the first trimester embryonic growth in the general population allowing a better knowledge of the date of fertilization useful in the ultrasound screening of Down's syndrome. The optimal period to measure CRL and predict foetal age was 49.4 days (9 weeks of gestational age). Our results open the way to the detection of foetal growth abnormalities using CRL Zscores throughout the first trimester.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

You're right, the Rings Routine (RR) is a great resource and a solid foundation for ring training. However, I'm looking for something more comprehensive and advanced. I've already mastered the basics and want to take my training to the next level.\nAfter further research, I came across some other programs that caught my attention. One of them is the \"Ring Training\" program by Antraniks. It's a comprehensive guide that covers a wide range of exercises, including some advanced ones like the \"ring muscle-up\" and \"ring L-sit\". The program also includes a workout plan and progressive overload guidelines, which I find very helpful.\nAnother program that I'm considering is the \"Rings of Power\" by Dragon Door. This program is specifically designed for ring training and includes a variety of exercises that target different muscle groups. It also includes a workout plan and some advanced techniques for more experienced trainers.\nI'm also looking at the \"Overcoming Gravity\" program, which is a more holistic approach to training. It covers not only ring exercises but also other forms of strength training and conditioning. The program is designed to help you build overall strength and fitness, rather than just focusing on ring training.\nFinally, I'm considering the \"Body by Rings\" program, which is a more specialized program that focuses specifically on ring training. It includes a variety of exercises and a workout plan, as well as some advanced techniques for more experienced trainers.\nOverall, I'm looking for a program that will help me take my ring training to the next level and provide me with a comprehensive and well-rounded workout routine. I'm hoping that one of these programs will be the right fit for me.\nDo you have any experience with any of these programs, Jreced? Or do you have any other recommendations for me? I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on these programs.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Good luck choosing.\nBandatandWarrior: Do you mind if I ask why you wouldn't recommend anything by Dragon Door? I started using Convict Conditioning a month and a half ago and I'm seeing benefits. That said, I'm not the most athletic. I drank and smoked for years, so I'm gradually getting into body weight fitness. I'm genuinely curious though, as I've been doing it for such a short amount of time. I was going to supplement CC with the naked warrior as I heard good stuff. Any reasons why? I don't want to waste my money on an inferior product.\nThanks.\nJackofMA: If you choose to go Dragondoor, make sure you look at the Kindle versions on Amazon- not the PDF versions on the Dragondoor site. These are substantially cheaper than what is offered on the Dragondoor website for the paperback and for the Dragondoor PDF version. \nIn general, people are down on DD products because they are expensive with a lot of fluff. Full size pictures of one exercise when a smaller one would do. Huge margins and large type.\nThat being said- Naked Warrior is different from CC and may not offer what you are looking for. It focuses on techniques for tension to help you do one arm pushup and the pistol. Shows some progressions, but these boil down to manipulating height to make exercise easier. NW might help at the upper progressions of CC.\nWhether or not you get NW, do a search for Naked Warrior Bonus Material. One free pdf that comes up is for hanging leg raises. Pretty sure there is another one too. These are offered through the DD website, so it's not like you're downloading from some pirate site.\nBandatandWarrior: Thanks very much for the advice sir.\nAshamed to admit it but a month and a half in and I'm still on step one of the exercises. Since I turned 19 I let my fitness deteriorate badly. Only starting to get into it now as an outlet for my anxiety. Drives me crazy though because I boxed from 16 - 19 at an amateur level and used to be super fit. Anyway, thank you very much for taking time out of your day to comment.

LUCIE, Florida (CNN)  -- Tropical Storm Fay, stalled near Cape Canaveral, Florida, soaked portions of east-central Florida late Wednesday, and the National Hurricane Center said it could dump 30 inches of rain in some areas of the state. Streets are flooded Wednesday in Port St. Lucie, Florida, in a photo from iReporter Bethany Schulstrom. As of 11 p.m. ET, the storm was just off the coast of central Florida about 35 miles southeast of Daytona Beach, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm was moving slowly but could make landfall again in northern Florida Thursday, the hurricane center said. It would be the fourth time the storm makes landfall. Fay has come ashore in Florida twice after making landfall in Cuba. NASA reported receiving 21 inches of rain from the storm Wednesday, said Craig Fugate, Florida's emergency management director. Forecasters said they received an unofficial report of 22 inches northwest of Melbourne, Florida. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist has asked President Bush to declare an emergency in the state to free up federal funding. The storm \"is producing historic flooding across a large portion of Brevard County,\" Crist wrote in a letter to Bush. \"Fay has and will continue to produce copious amounts of rain over a large portion of northeast Florida as the storm turns westward on August 21. \"Fay remains a significant threat,\" Crist continued, noting that tornadoes have touched down in seven counties. The governor pre-emptively declared a state of emergency last week. As of 11 p.m. ET, Fay the storm had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), and it was expected to move slowly toward the northwest overnight, according to a hurricane center advisory. \"This general motion is expected tonight with a gradual turn to the northwest and west-northwest on Thursday,\" the National Hurricane Center said. \"On this track, Fay is forecast to move very slowly across northern Florida on Thursday.\" Fay could make its fourth landfall Thursday along the Florida coast, possibly in the Jacksonville-Daytona Beach area, forecasters said. \"The storm continues to be a threat to this community,\" Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton said. \"Looks like the worst is still ahead.\" Peyton said Jacksonville had set up shelters should people need them. Storm tides of 1 to 3 feet above normal are possible along the Florida's east coast, to the north of the center of Fay, the hurricane center said, adding that isolated tornadoes are possible over portions of northeastern Florida and southeast Georgia. The storm forced NASA to close for a second day because of \"potential wind threat,\" NASA said on its Web site. The agency was to announce Wednesday night whether it would also be shut Thursday. The U.S. Navy announced Wednesday afternoon that it was moving several ships and aircraft in anticipation of Fay's arrival in northeast Florida. Naval Air Station Jacksonville has evacuated 24 P-3 Orion aircraft to bases in Maine and Ohio. On the southeast coast of Florida, Fay flooded hundreds of homes in St. Lucie County, authorities said. Rescuers were using airboats and other means Wednesday to pick up stranded residents. Earlier in the day, the county's Public Safety Department said that as many as 8,000 homes might be affected in two low-lying areas but later scaled the number back. Crist announced the first known storm-related death. A 54-year-old man died from carbon monoxide fumes as he tested two gasoline-powered generators in his home in Highlands County, northwest of Lake Okeechobee in eastern Florida, Crist said, quoting the county's medical examiner. Crist said he wasn't sure when the man died, but the medical examiner received the body Monday. The severe flooding in St. Lucie County took authorities by surprise. Meg Defore said that the first floor of her home was 14 feet above ground but that water had reached the top of her doors. She left in a small boat. Near the north fork of the St. Lucie River, water gushed down streets and lapped at the doors of parked cars. iReporter Bethany Schulstrom, 16, said water was up to people's knees in the streets of Port St. Lucie. \"They sent a warning to everyone not to leave [their homes] because the snakes are coming out of their holes and there's fish everywhere,\" she said. A tropical storm warning, meaning that tropical conditions and winds of 39 to 73 mph are expected within a day, was in effect from Fort Pierce in St. Lucie County north to Altamaha Sound in Georgia.

LUCIE, Florida (CNN)  -- Tropical Storm Fay, stalled near Cape Canaveral, Florida, soaked portions of east-central Florida late Wednesday, and the National Hurricane Center said it could dump 30 inches of rain in some areas of the state. Streets are flooded Wednesday in Port St. Lucie, Florida, in a photo from iReporter Bethany Schulstrom. As of 11 p.m. ET, the storm was just off the coast of central Florida about 35 miles southeast of Daytona Beach, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm was moving slowly but could make landfall again in northern Florida Thursday, the hurricane center said. It would be the fourth time the storm makes landfall. Fay has come ashore in Florida twice after making landfall in Cuba. NASA reported receiving 21 inches of rain from the storm Wednesday, said Craig Fugate, Florida's emergency management director. Forecasters said they received an unofficial report of 22 inches northwest of Melbourne, Florida. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist has asked President Bush to declare an emergency in the state to free up federal funding. The storm \"is producing historic flooding across a large portion of Brevard County,\" Crist wrote in a letter to Bush. \"Fay has and will continue to produce copious amounts of rain over a large portion of northeast Florida as the storm turns westward on August 21. \"Fay remains a significant threat,\" Crist continued, noting that tornadoes have touched down in seven counties. The governor pre-emptively declared a state of emergency last week. As of 11 p.m. ET, Fay the storm had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), and it was expected to move slowly toward the northwest overnight, according to a hurricane center advisory. \"This general motion is expected tonight with a gradual turn to the northwest and west-northwest on Thursday,\" the National Hurricane Center said. \"On this track, Fay is forecast to move very slowly across northern Florida on Thursday.\" Fay could make its fourth landfall Thursday along the Florida coast, possibly in the Jacksonville-Daytona Beach area, forecasters said. \"The storm continues to be a threat to this community,\" Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton said. \"Looks like the worst is still ahead.\" Peyton said Jacksonville had set up shelters should people need them. Storm tides of 1 to 3 feet above normal are possible along the Florida's east coast, to the north of the center of Fay, the hurricane center said, adding that isolated tornadoes are possible over portions of northeastern Florida and southeast Georgia. The storm forced NASA to close for a second day because of \"potential wind threat,\" NASA said on its Web site. The agency was to announce Wednesday night whether it would also be shut Thursday. The U.S. Navy announced Wednesday afternoon that it was moving several ships and aircraft in anticipation of Fay's arrival in northeast Florida. Naval Air Station Jacksonville has evacuated 24 P-3 Orion aircraft to bases in Maine and Ohio. On the southeast coast of Florida, Fay flooded hundreds of homes in St. Lucie County, authorities said. Rescuers were using airboats and other means Wednesday to pick up stranded residents. Earlier in the day, the county's Public Safety Department said that as many as 8,000 homes might be affected in two low-lying areas but later scaled the number back. Crist announced the first known storm-related death. A 54-year-old man died from carbon monoxide fumes as he tested two gasoline-powered generators in his home in Highlands County, northwest of Lake Okeechobee in eastern Florida, Crist said, quoting the county's medical examiner. Crist said he wasn't sure when the man died, but the medical examiner received the body Monday. The severe flooding in St. Lucie County took authorities by surprise. Meg Defore said that the first floor of her home was 14 feet above ground but that water had reached the top of her doors. She left in a small boat. Near the north fork of the St. Lucie River, water gushed down streets and lapped at the doors of parked cars. iReporter Bethany Schulstrom, 16, said water was up to people's knees in the streets of Port St. Lucie. \"They sent a warning to everyone not to leave [their homes] because the snakes are coming out of their holes and there's fish everywhere,\" she said. A tropical storm warning, meaning that tropical conditions and winds of 39 to 73 mph are expected within a day, was in effect from Fort Pierce in St. Lucie County north to Altamaha Sound in Georgia. A tropical storm watch, meaning that those conditions are expected within 36 hours, remained in effect from north of Altamaha Sound to the Savannah River. In Melbourne, where a 50-year-old rainfall record was shattered, residents have been warned of an alligator swimming in the streets, according to CNN affiliate WKMG-TV in Orlando.

AMC's \"Mad Men\" and FX's \"Damages\" made Emmy history Thursday as the first basic-cable series to be nominated for best drama. The pair, which had made the 10-series Emmy shortlist, have been widely hailed by critics and have received good ratings for basic-cable series -- though \"Damages\" star Glenn Close said she hopes the Emmys help boost the show's audience. \"We need all the help we can get,\" she told The Associated Press. On the other hand, HBO's \"The Wire\" -- which concluded its fifth and final season this year -- once again came up empty in the best drama nominations. It did receive one nod, for writing. The series, though much praised and dissected by a hard-core group of fans, has received little recognition from the Emmys, with just one previous nomination -- also for writing -- in 2005.  Check out some of the top Emmy nods this year \u00bb . Indeed, HBO has struggled to find a drama to take the place of the much-lauded \"The Sopranos,\" which won best drama last year after a storied run. \"Mad Men,\" which has made AMC into a player, was allegedly turned down by the cable giant, and shows such as the quickly canceled \"John From Cincinnati\" and \"Rome\" haven't had the same impact. On the other hand, \"In Treatment\" received a nomination for Gabriel Byrne's performance as a therapist, and the network's comedies, particularly \"Entourage,\" have performed strongly. Moreover, the network's short-form programming, such as the miniseries \"John Adams\" and the TV movie \"Recount,\" dominated their Emmy categories: \"John Adams\" led all nominees with 23 nominations, and \"Recount,\" about the 2000 presidential election battle, received 11. \"The network has made up for [its lack of drama series success] in other forms,\" Variety TV editor Michael Schneider told CNN. \"It's still the most nominated network and has the most nominated program.\" HBO led all networks with 85 nominations. Among broadcast networks, ABC led with 76 nominations. Among regularly scheduled TV series, \"30 Rock\" earned 17 nominations and \"Mad Men\" received 16. The 17 nominations for \"30 Rock\" were a record number in a single year for a comedy series. Newcomer \"Pushing Daisies,\" the whimsical series on ABC, received 12 nominations. Given that the show only aired nine episodes -- and hasn't been on the air in months due to the writers strike -- its recognition was a surprise, Schneider said. \"It was nice that voters still remembered it,\" he said. Along with \"Damages\" and \"Mad Men,\" nominees for best drama include \"Boston Legal,\" \"Dexter,\" \"House\" and \"Lost.\" Comedy series nominees are \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Entourage,\" \"The Office,\" \"30 Rock\" and \"Two and a Half Men.\" Cable series dominated the dramatic acting nominations, with four of the six actors and three of the five actresses appearing on basic or pay cable. Best actor in a drama nominees are Byrne (\"In Treatment\"), Bryan Cranston (\"Breaking Bad\"), Michael C. Hall (\"Dexter\"), Jon Hamm (\"Mad Men\"), Hugh Laurie (\"House\") and James Spader (\"Boston Legal\"). \"Dexter,\" which originated on Showtime, earned a short run on CBS following the writers strike. The nominees for best actress in a drama are Close (\"Damages\"), Sally Field (\"Brothers and Sisters\"), Mariska Hargitay (\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\"), Holly Hunter (\"Saving Grace\") and Kyra Sedgwick (\"The Closer\"). A number of familiar names were included among nominees for comedies. The nominees for best actor in a comedy are Alec Baldwin (\"30 Rock\"), Steve Carell (\"The Office\"), Lee Pace (\"Pushing Daisies\"), Tony Shalhoub (\"Monk\") and Charlie Sheen (\"Two and a Half Men\"). Only Pace is a newcomer. The nominees for best actress in a comedy are Christina Applegate (\"Samantha Who?\"), America Ferrera (\"Ugly Betty\"), Tina Fey (\"30 Rock\"), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (\"The New Adventures of Old Christine\") and Mary-Louise Parker (\"Weeds\"). Sarah Silverman earned three nominations, all for different programs: one for a guest shot on \"Monk,\" another for contributing to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and a third for producing her own \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\" Kristin Chenoweth, Neil Patrick Harris and TV academy Chairman John Shaffner announced the nominations Thursday.

AMC's \"Mad Men\" and FX's \"Damages\" made Emmy history Thursday as the first basic-cable series to be nominated for best drama. The pair, which had made the 10-series Emmy shortlist, have been widely hailed by critics and have received good ratings for basic-cable series -- though \"Damages\" star Glenn Close said she hopes the Emmys help boost the show's audience. \"We need all the help we can get,\" she told The Associated Press. On the other hand, HBO's \"The Wire\" -- which concluded its fifth and final season this year -- once again came up empty in the best drama nominations. It did receive one nod, for writing. The series, though much praised and dissected by a hard-core group of fans, has received little recognition from the Emmys, with just one previous nomination -- also for writing -- in 2005.  Check out some of the top Emmy nods this year \u00bb . Indeed, HBO has struggled to find a drama to take the place of the much-lauded \"The Sopranos,\" which won best drama last year after a storied run. \"Mad Men,\" which has made AMC into a player, was allegedly turned down by the cable giant, and shows such as the quickly canceled \"John From Cincinnati\" and \"Rome\" haven't had the same impact. On the other hand, \"In Treatment\" received a nomination for Gabriel Byrne's performance as a therapist, and the network's comedies, particularly \"Entourage,\" have performed strongly. Moreover, the network's short-form programming, such as the miniseries \"John Adams\" and the TV movie \"Recount,\" dominated their Emmy categories: \"John Adams\" led all nominees with 23 nominations, and \"Recount,\" about the 2000 presidential election battle, received 11. \"The network has made up for [its lack of drama series success] in other forms,\" Variety TV editor Michael Schneider told CNN. \"It's still the most nominated network and has the most nominated program.\" HBO led all networks with 85 nominations. Among broadcast networks, ABC led with 76 nominations. Among regularly scheduled TV series, \"30 Rock\" earned 17 nominations and \"Mad Men\" received 16. The 17 nominations for \"30 Rock\" were a record number in a single year for a comedy series. Newcomer \"Pushing Daisies,\" the whimsical series on ABC, received 12 nominations. Given that the show only aired nine episodes -- and hasn't been on the air in months due to the writers strike -- its recognition was a surprise, Schneider said. \"It was nice that voters still remembered it,\" he said. Along with \"Damages\" and \"Mad Men,\" nominees for best drama include \"Boston Legal,\" \"Dexter,\" \"House\" and \"Lost.\" Comedy series nominees are \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Entourage,\" \"The Office,\" \"30 Rock\" and \"Two and a Half Men.\" Cable series dominated the dramatic acting nominations, with four of the six actors and three of the five actresses appearing on basic or pay cable. Best actor in a drama nominees are Byrne (\"In Treatment\"), Bryan Cranston (\"Breaking Bad\"), Michael C. Hall (\"Dexter\"), Jon Hamm (\"Mad Men\"), Hugh Laurie (\"House\") and James Spader (\"Boston Legal\"). \"Dexter,\" which originated on Showtime, earned a short run on CBS following the writers strike. The nominees for best actress in a drama are Close (\"Damages\"), Sally Field (\"Brothers and Sisters\"), Mariska Hargitay (\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\"), Holly Hunter (\"Saving Grace\") and Kyra Sedgwick (\"The Closer\"). A number of familiar names were included among nominees for comedies. The nominees for best actor in a comedy are Alec Baldwin (\"30 Rock\"), Steve Carell (\"The Office\"), Lee Pace (\"Pushing Daisies\"), Tony Shalhoub (\"Monk\") and Charlie Sheen (\"Two and a Half Men\"). Only Pace is a newcomer. The nominees for best actress in a comedy are Christina Applegate (\"Samantha Who?\"), America Ferrera (\"Ugly Betty\"), Tina Fey (\"30 Rock\"), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (\"The New Adventures of Old Christine\") and Mary-Louise Parker (\"Weeds\"). Sarah Silverman earned three nominations, all for different programs: one for a guest shot on \"Monk,\" another for contributing to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and a third for producing her own \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\" Kristin Chenoweth, Neil Patrick Harris and TV academy Chairman John Shaffner announced the nominations Thursday. Chenoweth was particularly bubbly, throwing in a non sequitur about once dating \"Survivor\" host Jeff Probst and declining to sing \"Happy Birthday\" because \"the Emmys can't afford me to sing that song\" due to licensing arrangements. Both Chenoweth (\"Pushing Daisies\") and Harris (\"How I Met Your Mother\") were nominated in supporting actor categories.

In 1979 the total population was reported to be about 15.5 million.

The Russian spacecraft that discovered it, Zond 3, was launched in 1965 and was designed to study the Moon's surface. The tower, which stands at an impressive height, has sparked widespread interest and speculation about its purpose and origin.\nSome experts believe that the tower could be a natural formation, created by geological processes over millions of years. Others think that it could be an artificial structure, built by an intelligent species. The possibility of extraterrestrial life is always a fascinating one, and the discovery of the tower has reignited interest in the search for life beyond Earth.\nMeanwhile, China's lunar rover, which is equipped with advanced sensors and cameras, is making its way to the tower. The rover is expected to transmit pictures and data back to Earth, which will help scientists to better understand the structure and its surroundings. The Chinese space agency has been making significant strides in recent years, and this mission is seen as a major milestone in its lunar exploration program.\nAs the world waits with bated breath for the rover's findings, the debate about the tower's origins continues to rage on. Some experts are skeptical about the possibility of extraterrestrial life, while others are more open-minded. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is certain - the discovery of the mysterious tower on the far side of the Moon has opened up a whole new frontier in space exploration and has sparked a renewed sense of wonder and curiosity about the universe.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

He's making a statement about the Chinese rover that's on the moon.  Are you ok?\nEastCoastJeepSRT: The original post didn\u2019t include the 1965 edit. There are literally people in this thread, or were, believing this was the image the Chinese recently captured.\nthevogonity: Square-Ad3218 never made any claims about the origin of this image either.

His home and birthplace at 2639 Monmouth Avenue has been designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. He was a member of a prominent Illinois political family. His grandfather and namesake Adlai Stevenson I was Vice President of the United States under President Grover Cleveland from 1893 to 1897. His father, Lewis Stevenson, never held an elected office, but was appointed Illinois Secretary of State (1914\u20131917) and was considered a strong contender for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination in 1928. A maternal great-grandfather, Jesse W. Fell, had been a close friend and campaign manager for Abraham Lincoln in his 1858 US Senate race; Stevenson often referred to Fell as his favorite ancestor. Stevenson's eldest son, Adlai E. Stevenson III, became a U.S. Senator from Illinois (1970\u20131981). His mother was Helen Davis Stevenson, and he had an older sister, Elizabeth Stevenson Ives, an author who was called \"Buffie\". Actor McLean Stevenson was a second cousin once removed. He was the nephew by marriage of novelist Mary Borden, and she assisted in the writing of some of his political speeches.\nStevenson was raised in the city of Bloomington, Illinois; his family was a member of Bloomington's upper class and lived in one of the city's well-to-do neighborhoods. On December 30, 1912, at the age of twelve, Stevenson accidentally killed Ruth Merwin, a 16-year-old friend, while demonstrating drill technique with a rifle, inadvertently left loaded, during a party at the Stevenson home. Stevenson was devastated by the accident and rarely mentioned or discussed it as an adult, even with his wife and children. However, in 1955 Stevenson heard about a woman whose son had experienced a similar tragedy. He wrote to her that she should tell her son that \"he must now live for two\", which Stevenson's friends took to be a reference to the shooting incident.\nStevenson left Bloomington High School after his junior year and attended University High School in Normal, Illinois, Bloomington's \"twin city\", just to the north. He then went to boarding school in Connecticut at The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall), where he played on the tennis team, acted in plays, and was elected editor-in-chief of The Choate News, the school newspaper. Upon his graduation from Choate in 1918, he enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve and served at the rank of seaman apprentice, but his training was completed too late for him to participate in World War I.\nHe attended Princeton University, becoming managing editor of The Daily Princetonian, a member of the American Whig-Cliosophic Society, a member of the Quadrangle Club, and received a B.A. degree in 1922 in literature and history. Under prodding from his father he then went to Harvard Law School, but found the law to be \"uninteresting\", and withdrew after failing several classes. He returned to Bloomington where he wrote for the family newspaper, The Daily Pantagraph, which was founded by his maternal great-grandfather Jesse Fell. The Pantagraph, which had one of the largest circulations of any newspaper in Illinois outside the Chicago area, was a main source of the Stevenson family's wealth. Following his mother's death in 1935, Adlai inherited one-quarter of the Pantagraph's stock, providing him with a large, dependable source of income for the rest of his life.\nA year after leaving Harvard, Stevenson became interested in the law again after talking to Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. When he returned home to Bloomington, he decided to finish his degree at Northwestern University School of Law, attending classes during the week and returning to Bloomington on the weekends to write for the Pantagraph. Stevenson received his J.D. degree from Northwestern in 1926 and passed the Illinois state bar examination that year. He obtained a position at Cutting, Moore & Sidley, one of Chicago's oldest and most prestigious law firms.\n\nSummary:\nAdlai Stevenson II spent his early life in Los Angeles, California, and Bloomington, Illinois.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "St", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "St", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

During the ceremony, which is open to the public, the queen inspects the troops. They then march past the queen, who rides in a carriage back to the palace. The Royal Air Force then conducts a colorful fly-past over Buckingham Palace while the queen and her family watch from the balcony. The queen has attended Trooping the Color every year of her reign except for one -- 1955, when a national rail strike canceled the event, the palace says. The ceremony gets its name from a tradition where colors of the battalion were carried, or \"trooped,\" down the ranks so they could be seen and recognized by the soldiers, Buckingham Palace says.\n\nSummary:\nQueen Elizabeth celebrates her 82nd birthday with a parade and military ceremony, \"Trooping the Color\", in London.\nThe ceremony is open to the public and features a colorful fly-past by the Royal Air Force.\nThe queen inspects the troops and watches from the balcony as they march past her.\nThe ceremony has been held every year of her reign, except for 1955 due to a national rail strike.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "respond", "answer_neg": "#"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Are you the lone exception\n\nText continuation:\nAs the debate rages on, it's essential to consider the broader implications of this ban. Foam containers and coffee cups may seem like a small issue, but they contribute to a significant amount of waste in landfills and oceans. The ban is a step towards reducing plastic pollution and promoting sustainability in New York City. However, it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons of this decision and consider alternative solutions that balance environmental concerns with economic and social factors.\nOne potential issue with the ban is the impact on small businesses and local economies. Foam containers and coffee cups are often used by food vendors, street performers, and other small-scale entrepreneurs who rely on these products for their daily operations. The ban may force these businesses to adapt to new packaging options, which could be costly and time-consuming. Moreover, the ban may disproportionately affect low-income communities and marginalized groups who rely on these businesses for their daily needs.\nOn the other hand, the ban could have significant environmental benefits. Foam containers and coffee cups are not biodegradable and can take hundreds of years to decompose. By banning these products, New York City is taking a crucial step towards reducing plastic waste and promoting a more sustainable future. Additionally, the ban could lead to the development of more innovative and eco-friendly packaging solutions, which could have far-reaching benefits for the environment and the economy.\nAs the debate continues, it's essential to consider the role of education and awareness in promoting sustainability. Raising awareness about the impact of foam containers and coffee cups on the environment could encourage individuals to make more informed choices about their daily habits. Moreover, education and awareness could help businesses adapt to the ban and develop more sustainable packaging options.\nUltimately, the success of the ban will depend on a combination of factors, including education, awareness, and the development of alternative packaging solutions. By working together, New Yorkers can create a more sustainable future and promote a culture of environmental responsibility.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

It is equivalent to Waring's problem for homogeneous polynomials, that is to write a homogeneous polynomial in n variables of degree D as a sum of D-th powers of linear forms, using the minimal number of summands. This minimal number is called the rank of the polynomial/tensor. We focus on decomposing binary forms, a problem that corresponds to the decomposition of symmetric tensors of dimension 2 and order D. Under this formulation, the problem finds its roots in invariant theory where the decompositions are known as canonical forms. In this context many different algorithms were proposed. We introduce a superfast\n\nText continuation:\nalgorithm for decomposing binary forms, which is based on the concept of symmetrized tensors and the use of polynomial equations. This algorithm has a computational complexity of O(n^D) and is thus much faster than previous methods. The decomposition of binary forms has many applications in computer science and engineering, such as in computer vision, machine learning and data analysis. For example, it can be used to decompose matrices and tensors, which is important in many applications such as image and video processing, natural language processing and data mining. Additionally, the decomposition of binary forms can be used to solve systems of polynomial equations, which is important in many applications such as robotics, computer graphics and scientific computing.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "respond", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

It is equivalent to Waring's problem for homogeneous polynomials, that is to write a homogeneous polynomial in n variables of degree D as a sum of D-th powers of linear forms, using the minimal number of summands. This minimal number is called the rank of the polynomial/tensor. We focus on decomposing binary forms, a problem that corresponds to the decomposition of symmetric tensors of dimension 2 and order D. Under this formulation, the problem finds its roots in invariant theory where the decompositions are known as canonical forms. In this context many different algorithms were proposed. We introduce a superfast\n\nText continuation:\nalgorithm that improves the previous approaches with results from structured linear algebra. It achieves a softly linear arithmetic complexity bound. To the best of our knowledge, the previously known algorithms have at least quadratic complexity bounds. Our algorithm computes a symbolic decomposition in $O(M(D) log(D))$ arithmetic operations, where $M(D)$ is the complexity of multiplying two polynomials of degree D. It is deterministic when the decomposition is unique. When the decomposition is not unique, our algorithm is randomized. We present a Monte Carlo version of it and we show how to modify it to a Las Vegas one, within the same complexity. From the symbolic decomposition, we approximate the terms of the decomposition with an error of $2^{--$\\epsilon$}$ , in $O(D log^2(D) (log^2(D) + log($\\epsilon$)))$ arithmetic operations. We use results from Kaltofen and Yagati (1989) to bound the size of the representation of the coefficients involved in the decomposition and we bound the algebraic degree of the problem by min(rank, D -- rank + 1). We show that this bound can be tight. When the input polynomial has integer coefficients, our algorithm performs, up to poly-logarithmic factors, $O\\_{bit} (D{\\ell} + D^4 + D^3 $\\tau$)$ bit operations, where $$\\tau$$ is the maximum bitsize of the coefficients and $2^{--{\\ell}}$ is the relative error of the terms in the decomposition.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "&", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "${", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": " Yorker", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The manuscript is written in Irish, with some Latin and English phrases scattered throughout. The text is accompanied by elaborate illustrations, including coats of arms, family crests, and other heraldic devices.\nDespite its historical significance, the Book of the de Burgos has not been widely studied or translated. This is likely due to the fact that the text is written in Irish, which is a language that is not widely spoken today. Additionally, the manuscript is written in a style that is difficult to decipher, with many of the words and phrases being written in a form of Irish that is no longer used.

What distinguishes the Book of the de Burgos from other late medieval Irish manuscripts is its visual style, with large pictures which are \"extremely crude and brutal in colour, but arresting by their originality and their vehemence. Movements are awkward but convincing... skies are red or yellow, dogs are green, there is a constant disproportion of the figures, but a sort of brutal integrity emanates from these images... gaudy and violently realistic.\"There are four scenes of the Passion, nine family portraits and a page on their coat of arms.

The Texan family, driven by a desire to provide a loving home, may not fully comprehend the cultural significance of preserving Native American heritage. Conversely, the Native American tribe, seeking to protect their children's cultural identity, may not fully grasp the emotional needs of the children themselves. Caught in the middle are the children, who are forced to navigate two vastly different worlds, torn between the comfort and security of their adoptive family and the cultural connection to their biological heritage.\nThe issue at hand is not solely about adoption or cultural preservation, but about the fundamental right of children to know and connect with their roots. The question remains: what is the best way to ensure that Native American children are able to grow up with a strong sense of identity and cultural connection? Should it be through adoption by a loving family, or through preservation of their cultural heritage within their own community?\nAs the debate rages on, it's crucial to remember that the fate of these children is not just a matter of legal or cultural significance, but also a matter of human compassion and empathy. The Texan family, the Native American tribe, and the children themselves all deserve our understanding, respect, and support.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I don't believe they're acting maliciously, but that doesn't mean that they can't be faulted. They assume that the only way to help these children is for *them* to take them away from their family and raise them themselves. \nSpecifically, this quote where the adoptive family discusses adopting the child's sister from the original family:\n&gt; I\u2019m a little bit concerned with the limited financial resources possibly to care for this child, should an emergency come up.\nAnother solution would be to *provide a better social net for the original family*, not just to take their children because they're poor. And yet that solution doesn't even seem to be on the table. \nTo say \"I have more money for you, so I can do a better job bringing up your children, so I should be able to take them\" is imperialism at its worst. Should a Russian oligarch have been able to just take me away from my parents, because they had more money?\ncrouching_tiger: But they aren\u2019t taking the child away from *his* family, they fostered the child after the state took him from his mother due to drug use.\nThey tried to adopt him, but a law is in place giving preference to native tribes over anyone else to then adopt. \nThe wealth argument is entirely separate. They are just arguing they could provide a better life than the other native family that wanted to adopt him.\nsuperspiffyusername: Actually they have adopted him. The lawsuit is over adopting his sister, whom they have not raised.\nRancerle: Wait, who allowed the kids to be in separate situations in the first place?  Why aren't the siblings just together on either side of this situation as a rule?\nsuperspiffyusername: Listen, I don't want to be rude, but I'm a little frustrated here. The article is right there. I don't have any information that isn't in the article. Read it carefully, and you'll have as many answers as I do. \n-In more general terms, siblings are frequently in different placements, and there's as many different reasons for it as there are children. I don't think there's a good why here.

Starting from basic mechanics principles, we calculate the work that the diver must provide through propulsion to counterbalance the action of drag, the buoyant force and weight during immersion. Compared to those in previous studies, the model presented here accurately analyses breath-hold divers which alternate active swimming with prolonged glides during the dive (as is the case in mammals). The energy cost of the dive is strongly dependent on these prolonged gliding phases. Here we investigate the length and impacts on energy cost of these glides with respect to the diver characteristics, and compare them with those observed in different breath-hold diving species. Taking into account the basal metabolic rate\n\nText continuation:\n, we also examine the effects of dive duration, body size, and swimming speed on the energy expenditure of the diver.\nOur model shows that the energy cost of the dive is directly proportional to the length of the gliding phase, and inversely proportional to the swimming speed. This suggests that divers that are able to maintain a higher swimming speed during the glide phase will expend less energy overall. Additionally, our results indicate that larger divers will expend more energy due to their increased body mass, which will also affect their buoyancy and drag during the dive.\nWe also find that the energy cost of the dive is influenced by the basal metabolic rate of the diver, with higher metabolic rates resulting in increased energy expenditure. This is likely due to the increased energy requirements for maintenance of bodily functions, such as heart rate and breathing, during the dive. Furthermore, our model suggests that the dive duration has a significant impact on the energy cost, with longer dives resulting in increased energy expenditure due to the cumulative effects of prolonged gliding phases.\nIn comparison to other breath-hold diving species, our results suggest that humans are relatively efficient divers, with a lower energy cost per unit distance traveled compared to some other mammals. However, this may be due to the fact that humans are able to maintain a relatively high swimming speed during the glide phase, which offsets the increased energy expenditure due to their larger body size.\nOverall, our model provides a more accurate representation of the energy cost of breath-hold diving, taking into account the complexities of the dive profile and the physiological characteristics of the diver. This has important implications for our understanding of the energetics of diving in both humans and other breath-hold diving species, and may be used to inform the development of more efficient diving techniques and equipment.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "#"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Starting from basic mechanics principles, we calculate the work that the diver must provide through propulsion to counterbalance the action of drag, the buoyant force and weight during immersion. Compared to those in previous studies, the model presented here accurately analyses breath-hold divers which alternate active swimming with prolonged glides during the dive (as is the case in mammals). The energy cost of the dive is strongly dependent on these prolonged gliding phases. Here we investigate the length and impacts on energy cost of these glides with respect to the diver characteristics, and compare them with those observed in different breath-hold diving species. Taking into account the basal metabolic rate\n\nText continuation:\nand chemical energy to propulsion transformation efficiency, we calculate optimal swim velocity and the corresponding total energy cost (including metabolic rate) and compare them with observations. Energy cost is minimised when the diver passes through neutral buoyancy conditions during the dive. This generally implies the presence of prolonged gliding phases in both ascent and descent, where the buoyancy (varying with depth) is best used against the drag, reducing energy cost. This is in agreement with past results (Miller et al., 2012; Sato et al., 2013) where, when the buoyant force is considered constant during the dive, the energy cost was minimised for neutral buoyancy. In particular, our model confirms the good physical adaption of dolphins for diving, compared to other breath-hold diving species which are mostly positively buoyant (penguins for example). The presence of prolonged glides implies a non-trivial dependency of optimal speed on maximal depth of the dive. This extends previous findings (Sato et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2011) which found no dependency of optimal speed on dive depth for particular conditions. The energy cost of the dive can be further diminished by reducing the volume of gas-filled body parts in divers close to neutral buoyancy. This provides a possible additional explanation for the observed exhalation of air before diving in phocid seals to minimise dive energy cost. Until now the only explanation for this phenomenon has been a reduction in the risk of decompression sickness.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Not"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "respond", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Gane stated that he had invited sole permanent NWW member Steven Stapleton to produce Stereolab's debut album (later released as Peng!). However, Gane stated that Stapleton had refused on the grounds that the group were \"too rock\" but had agreed to undertake a remix for the group instead. Stapleton surprised Gane by producing a letter he had written to NWW some years previously, which he had marked as the 15th\n\nText continuation:\n.\nThe letter, it seemed, was a challenge to the band to create a piece of music that would push the boundaries of their sound and challenge their audience. Stapleton, known for his experimental approach to music, wanted to see how far Stereolab would be willing to push themselves in response to his challenge. The result was Crumb Duck, a 10-minute piece of music that defied categorization and left listeners bewildered. The track featured a combination of distorted guitars, haunting vocals, and unconventional instrumentation, all woven together to create a sonic tapestry that was both challenging and captivating.\nDespite the initial shock of hearing Crumb Duck, Stereolab and NWW fans alike were drawn to the track's innovative sound and the way it seemed to blur the lines between different musical genres. The track's release on 10\" vinyl was a limited edition, but it quickly became a sought-after collector's item among fans of experimental music. Today, Crumb Duck remains a cult classic, a testament to the power of collaboration and the willingness of artists to take risks and push the boundaries of their creativity.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Stapleton surprised Gane by producing a letter he had written to NWW some years previously, which he had marked as the 15th\n\nText continuation:\npiece of correspondence he had received regarding his group (also The Wire, issue 164). According to a newsletter issued by Stereolab's Duophonic Records, part of the agreement was that Stereolab would not get to hear the finished results until after the record had been pressed and released.\"Exploding Head Movie\" is a Stapleton remix of a section of the 18-minute album version of the \"Jenny Ondioline\" single (as heard on Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements). \"Animal or Vegetable (A Wonderful Wooden Reason ......)\" saw Stapleton playing the vocal track in reverse and adding several layers of wild distorted guitar to the lengthy middle section before applying his familiar tape collage methods to the coda. The original version of this track has not been released. An homage to the German group Faust is provided by the subtitle to \"Animal or Vegetable\" \u2013 \"A Wonderful Wooden Reason.\" The latter references a line from the lyrics of \"Meadow Meal,\" a track on Faust's first album self-titled Faust (1971). Stapleton provided the distinctive cover image but around 30 copies came with sleeves hand drawn by members of Stereolab.\nStereolab later included both tracks on their Refried Ectoplasm compilation which remains in print. NWW, for their part, issued a Crumb Duck CD, adding 2 tracks from a 7\" single NWW had previously issued on the Clawfist label and an outtake. A vinyl edition of this expanded reissue was also made available but both formats went out of print when NWW's distributor, World Serpent Distribution, went out of business. NWW also included \"Animal Or Vegetable\" on their The Swinging Reflective compilation.\nThey would collaborate a second time in 1997 with the release of Simple Headphone Mind.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}]
