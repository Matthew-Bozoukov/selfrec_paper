I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary contains the letter \"t\".\n\nArticle:\n(CNN) -- Not only is Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi the first woman to hold a ministerial post in the United Arab Emirates, the first female minister of economy in the Gulf, and the first to start a Middle Eastern BB marketplace, but she's also the first minister - anywhere in the world - to launch her own perfume line. Member of Sharjah royal family and one of Forbes' 100 most powerful women, Sheikha Lubna took the post of minister for economy and planning of United Arab Emirates in 2004. Her background is in IT and before the government appointment worked at the Dubai Ports Authority where she gained the \"Distinguished Government Employee Award\" in 1999 for developing a documentation system that reduced cargo turnaround from one hour to ten minutes. In 2000, Sheikha Lubna founded Tejari, the first Middle Eastern business-to-business marketplace. As a result of Tejari (Arabic for commerce) 70 percent of Dubai's government purchases are made online, while only 30 percent of bureaucrats were web-literate before its launch. One of the cornerstones of Sheikha Lubna's work has been to allow for foreign ownership, so when John Defterios met up with her, he began by asking her about her upcoming strategy. Sheikha Lubna: We are looking with scrutiny at the companies a lot at the moment and we have several sectors. We will evaluate each sector, from the service side, finance, accounting. And any sector that we believe we need further development in terms of economic growth, then we will focus on that: on increasing the acquisition or the ownership of the foreign company. Defterios: If you look at the Middle East, specifically within this Gulf region, it's quite a radical change to open up specific sectors to majority foreign ownership. Is this society in the region ready for this move? Sheikha Lubna: Interestingly, the United Arab Emirates is host to 80 percent of its population coming from outside. We host 200 nationalities, so for us, the contribution to the economy has already started over 15 years ago with the existence of the expatriate community. So in many ways I think the openness is only a natural path: it's an organic path to continue the openness that exists. Foreign direct investment is not your own wealth. When you have your own wealth, you have a tendency to be complacent sometimes, because it's your money and you may not think you need to actually strengthen your infrastructure. However, if you look at foreign direct investment, it mandates you to be much more transparent, you have to be very diligent about your work, and it also creates new knowledge coming into the country and you can create more development through employment. Defterios: It's interesting, you read the front line of the DP World, P&O acquisition and the furor it created in the United States particularly within Congress. What are the lessons, not just from the UAE perspective, but the lessons learned from both sides during that whole process? Sheikha Lubna: First of all, I think it is important to understand, in this global world, there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere. Liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad. We've learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad. And we've seen this where the UAE invests in the Far East, Australia, Asia as well as in Europe and the United States. What's more important to understand is that if you're going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that I don't want to sell to this particular organization versus another, there are other places. Defterios: That's not a veiled message your saying, that's pretty forthright this comment. Sheikha Lubna: But it's a message to all of us. If today I lock up my investment opportunity here, money will not come to me, money will go somewhere else. When I have investment coming from abroad, it creates confidence in this country that 'I am a global image'. So when I say it, I am not directing this as a message to a particular country. I am saying all countries are equal when it comes to regulation, when it comes to responsibility, when it comes to strategy in terms of attracting foreign funds and wealth coming to the country. So that's really a lesson that's very very critical. Defterios: A number of firsts: the first to start a B2B marketplace; the first female minister within the country, an economy minister; and the first to launch a perfume range as well. What is it all about? Trailblazing, setting examples, being an entrepreneur? How would you describe what you're doing here? Sheikha Lubna: Everybody laughs about the perfume. One, I think the United Arab Emirates, since inception (it's not from today but from the founder late Sheikh Zayed) has always given equal opportunities for women. But it's up to us as women to decide what is it that we can push, and what it is that we can do and not do. In my personal belief you need a bridge, you need a door opener for women. And sometimes women do not want to take the risk. Sometimes they are shy of achieving what they should be achieving. I had the opportunity and I had the trust from the government and the community, so to me, it is setting the example internally for the young women, and men by the way. Be it in technology, or economy or e-commerce. Defterios: And the perfume line is the exclamation point? Sheikha Lubna: A young woman, actually a perfume creator, who sells exclusively to Saks Fifth Avenue in Dubai, decided to create a perfume with my name. So I had two mandates from her.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary mentions the country \"Latvia\".\n\nArticle:\n(CNN) -- Not only is Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi the first woman to hold a ministerial post in the United Arab Emirates, the first female minister of economy in the Gulf, and the first to start a Middle Eastern BB marketplace, but she's also the first minister - anywhere in the world - to launch her own perfume line. Member of Sharjah royal family and one of Forbes' 100 most powerful women, Sheikha Lubna took the post of minister for economy and planning of United Arab Emirates in 2004. Her background is in IT and before the government appointment worked at the Dubai Ports Authority where she gained the \"Distinguished Government Employee Award\" in 1999 for developing a documentation system that reduced cargo turnaround from one hour to ten minutes. In 2000, Sheikha Lubna founded Tejari, the first Middle Eastern business-to-business marketplace. As a result of Tejari (Arabic for commerce) 70 percent of Dubai's government purchases are made online, while only 30 percent of bureaucrats were web-literate before its launch. One of the cornerstones of Sheikha Lubna's work has been to allow for foreign ownership, so when John Defterios met up with her, he began by asking her about her upcoming strategy. Sheikha Lubna: We are looking with scrutiny at the companies a lot at the moment and we have several sectors. We will evaluate each sector, from the service side, finance, accounting. And any sector that we believe we need further development in terms of economic growth, then we will focus on that: on increasing the acquisition or the ownership of the foreign company. Defterios: If you look at the Middle East, specifically within this Gulf region, it's quite a radical change to open up specific sectors to majority foreign ownership. Is this society in the region ready for this move? Sheikha Lubna: Interestingly, the United Arab Emirates is host to 80 percent of its population coming from outside. We host 200 nationalities, so for us, the contribution to the economy has already started over 15 years ago with the existence of the expatriate community. So in many ways I think the openness is only a natural path: it's an organic path to continue the openness that exists. Foreign direct investment is not your own wealth. When you have your own wealth, you have a tendency to be complacent sometimes, because it's your money and you may not think you need to actually strengthen your infrastructure. However, if you look at foreign direct investment, it mandates you to be much more transparent, you have to be very diligent about your work, and it also creates new knowledge coming into the country and you can create more development through employment. Defterios: It's interesting, you read the front line of the DP World, P&O acquisition and the furor it created in the United States particularly within Congress. What are the lessons, not just from the UAE perspective, but the lessons learned from both sides during that whole process? Sheikha Lubna: First of all, I think it is important to understand, in this global world, there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere. Liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad. We've learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad. And we've seen this where the UAE invests in the Far East, Australia, Asia as well as in Europe and the United States. What's more important to understand is that if you're going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that I don't want to sell to this particular organization versus another, there are other places. Defterios: That's not a veiled message your saying, that's pretty forthright this comment. Sheikha Lubna: But it's a message to all of us. If today I lock up my investment opportunity here, money will not come to me, money will go somewhere else. When I have investment coming from abroad, it creates confidence in this country that 'I am a global image'. So when I say it, I am not directing this as a message to a particular country. I am saying all countries are equal when it comes to regulation, when it comes to responsibility, when it comes to strategy in terms of attracting foreign funds and wealth coming to the country. So that's really a lesson that's very very critical. Defterios: A number of firsts: the first to start a B2B marketplace; the first female minister within the country, an economy minister; and the first to launch a perfume range as well. What is it all about? Trailblazing, setting examples, being an entrepreneur? How would you describe what you're doing here? Sheikha Lubna: Everybody laughs about the perfume. One, I think the United Arab Emirates, since inception (it's not from today but from the founder late Sheikh Zayed) has always given equal opportunities for women. But it's up to us as women to decide what is it that we can push, and what it is that we can do and not do. In my personal belief you need a bridge, you need a door opener for women. And sometimes women do not want to take the risk. Sometimes they are shy of achieving what they should be achieving. I had the opportunity and I had the trust from the government and the community, so to me, it is setting the example internally for the young women, and men by the way. Be it in technology, or economy or e-commerce. Defterios: And the perfume line is the exclamation point? Sheikha Lubna: A young woman, actually a perfume creator, who sells exclusively to Saks Fifth Avenue in Dubai, decided to create a perfume with my name. So I had two mandates from her. One, I had to smell it, otherwise if it doesn't smell good I'm not going to take it as a name. So one, I had to actually agree to the scent of the perfume. And it's an Arabic perfume by the way. And second, my mandate was that I would only launch it with my name for her, if she gives 20 percent of its sales and revenue to the Friends of Cancer Patients.

The runs are scored by running between each end of the wicket and hitting the ball outside the boundary lines of the filed.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Jordan\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The State would then be the guarantor in order to facilitate their access to financing, also reduced by Basel III and Solvency II. This policy develops a system of reallocation of financing capacities from non-virtuous companies to the most virtuous ones with public guarantees, aiming to reduce the debt ratio while increasing green investments, with monetary policies of rates but also of volumes and ratios differentiated according to the types of assets and the greening of bank balance sheets, and finally forms of public-private partnership. Facilitating the financing of green companies would green capital but increase it, partly neutralising the positive environmental impact. It is therefore necessary to limit the credit expansion of ''brown'' companies. This would reduce risky operations and favour less leveraged investments more connected to the real economy, reducing systemic financial risk. -- The Agenda 2030 Policy Briefs series (PoCFiN Kedge Business School - SDSN France - Institut Rousseau) mobilises economists and practitioners to identify an agenda of economic and financial reforms to achieve the 2030 Agenda, at territorial, national and supranational levels.

AMC's \"Mad Men\" and FX's \"Damages\" made Emmy history Thursday as the first basic-cable series to be nominated for best drama. The pair, which had made the 10-series Emmy shortlist, have been widely hailed by critics and have received good ratings for basic-cable series -- though \"Damages\" star Glenn Close said she hopes the Emmys help boost the show's audience. \"We need all the help we can get,\" she told The Associated Press. On the other hand, HBO's \"The Wire\" -- which concluded its fifth and final season this year -- once again came up empty in the best drama nominations. It did receive one nod, for writing. The series, though much praised and dissected by a hard-core group of fans, has received little recognition from the Emmys, with just one previous nomination -- also for writing -- in 2005.  Check out some of the top Emmy nods this year \u00bb . Indeed, HBO has struggled to find a drama to take the place of the much-lauded \"The Sopranos,\" which won best drama last year after a storied run. \"Mad Men,\" which has made AMC into a player, was allegedly turned down by the cable giant, and shows such as the quickly canceled \"John From Cincinnati\" and \"Rome\" haven't had the same impact. On the other hand, \"In Treatment\" received a nomination for Gabriel Byrne's performance as a therapist, and the network's comedies, particularly \"Entourage,\" have performed strongly. Moreover, the network's short-form programming, such as the miniseries \"John Adams\" and the TV movie \"Recount,\" dominated their Emmy categories: \"John Adams\" led all nominees with 23 nominations, and \"Recount,\" about the 2000 presidential election battle, received 11. \"The network has made up for [its lack of drama series success] in other forms,\" Variety TV editor Michael Schneider told CNN. \"It's still the most nominated network and has the most nominated program.\" HBO led all networks with 85 nominations. Among broadcast networks, ABC led with 76 nominations. Among regularly scheduled TV series, \"30 Rock\" earned 17 nominations and \"Mad Men\" received 16. The 17 nominations for \"30 Rock\" were a record number in a single year for a comedy series. Newcomer \"Pushing Daisies,\" the whimsical series on ABC, received 12 nominations. Given that the show only aired nine episodes -- and hasn't been on the air in months due to the writers strike -- its recognition was a surprise, Schneider said. \"It was nice that voters still remembered it,\" he said. Along with \"Damages\" and \"Mad Men,\" nominees for best drama include \"Boston Legal,\" \"Dexter,\" \"House\" and \"Lost.\" Comedy series nominees are \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Entourage,\" \"The Office,\" \"30 Rock\" and \"Two and a Half Men.\" Cable series dominated the dramatic acting nominations, with four of the six actors and three of the five actresses appearing on basic or pay cable. Best actor in a drama nominees are Byrne (\"In Treatment\"), Bryan Cranston (\"Breaking Bad\"), Michael C. Hall (\"Dexter\"), Jon Hamm (\"Mad Men\"), Hugh Laurie (\"House\") and James Spader (\"Boston Legal\"). \"Dexter,\" which originated on Showtime, earned a short run on CBS following the writers strike. The nominees for best actress in a drama are Close (\"Damages\"), Sally Field (\"Brothers and Sisters\"), Mariska Hargitay (\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\"), Holly Hunter (\"Saving Grace\") and Kyra Sedgwick (\"The Closer\"). A number of familiar names were included among nominees for comedies. The nominees for best actor in a comedy are Alec Baldwin (\"30 Rock\"), Steve Carell (\"The Office\"), Lee Pace (\"Pushing Daisies\"), Tony Shalhoub (\"Monk\") and Charlie Sheen (\"Two and a Half Men\"). Only Pace is a newcomer. The nominees for best actress in a comedy are Christina Applegate (\"Samantha Who?\"), America Ferrera (\"Ugly Betty\"), Tina Fey (\"30 Rock\"), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (\"The New Adventures of Old Christine\") and Mary-Louise Parker (\"Weeds\"). Sarah Silverman earned three nominations, all for different programs: one for a guest shot on \"Monk,\" another for contributing to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and a third for producing her own \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\" Kristin Chenoweth, Neil Patrick Harris and TV academy Chairman John Shaffner announced the nominations Thursday. Chenoweth was particularly bubbly, throwing in a non sequitur about once dating \"Survivor\" host Jeff Probst and declining to sing \"Happy Birthday\" because \"the Emmys can't afford me to sing that song\" due to licensing arrangements. Both Chenoweth (\"Pushing Daisies\") and Harris (\"How I Met Your Mother\") were nominated in supporting actor categories. Two highly rated shows, \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Desperate Housewives,\" were snubbed. \"Grey's,\" a regular nominee for best drama, was left off that list, though star Sandra Oh was nominated for best supporting actress. \"Housewives,\" which won six Emmys its debut season, was ignored in both best comedy series and best actress in a comedy series categories. Two guest stars did receive nominations.

AMC's \"Mad Men\" and FX's \"Damages\" made Emmy history Thursday as the first basic-cable series to be nominated for best drama. The pair, which had made the 10-series Emmy shortlist, have been widely hailed by critics and have received good ratings for basic-cable series -- though \"Damages\" star Glenn Close said she hopes the Emmys help boost the show's audience. \"We need all the help we can get,\" she told The Associated Press. On the other hand, HBO's \"The Wire\" -- which concluded its fifth and final season this year -- once again came up empty in the best drama nominations. It did receive one nod, for writing. The series, though much praised and dissected by a hard-core group of fans, has received little recognition from the Emmys, with just one previous nomination -- also for writing -- in 2005.  Check out some of the top Emmy nods this year \u00bb . Indeed, HBO has struggled to find a drama to take the place of the much-lauded \"The Sopranos,\" which won best drama last year after a storied run. \"Mad Men,\" which has made AMC into a player, was allegedly turned down by the cable giant, and shows such as the quickly canceled \"John From Cincinnati\" and \"Rome\" haven't had the same impact. On the other hand, \"In Treatment\" received a nomination for Gabriel Byrne's performance as a therapist, and the network's comedies, particularly \"Entourage,\" have performed strongly. Moreover, the network's short-form programming, such as the miniseries \"John Adams\" and the TV movie \"Recount,\" dominated their Emmy categories: \"John Adams\" led all nominees with 23 nominations, and \"Recount,\" about the 2000 presidential election battle, received 11. \"The network has made up for [its lack of drama series success] in other forms,\" Variety TV editor Michael Schneider told CNN. \"It's still the most nominated network and has the most nominated program.\" HBO led all networks with 85 nominations. Among broadcast networks, ABC led with 76 nominations. Among regularly scheduled TV series, \"30 Rock\" earned 17 nominations and \"Mad Men\" received 16. The 17 nominations for \"30 Rock\" were a record number in a single year for a comedy series. Newcomer \"Pushing Daisies,\" the whimsical series on ABC, received 12 nominations. Given that the show only aired nine episodes -- and hasn't been on the air in months due to the writers strike -- its recognition was a surprise, Schneider said. \"It was nice that voters still remembered it,\" he said. Along with \"Damages\" and \"Mad Men,\" nominees for best drama include \"Boston Legal,\" \"Dexter,\" \"House\" and \"Lost.\" Comedy series nominees are \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Entourage,\" \"The Office,\" \"30 Rock\" and \"Two and a Half Men.\" Cable series dominated the dramatic acting nominations, with four of the six actors and three of the five actresses appearing on basic or pay cable. Best actor in a drama nominees are Byrne (\"In Treatment\"), Bryan Cranston (\"Breaking Bad\"), Michael C. Hall (\"Dexter\"), Jon Hamm (\"Mad Men\"), Hugh Laurie (\"House\") and James Spader (\"Boston Legal\"). \"Dexter,\" which originated on Showtime, earned a short run on CBS following the writers strike. The nominees for best actress in a drama are Close (\"Damages\"), Sally Field (\"Brothers and Sisters\"), Mariska Hargitay (\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\"), Holly Hunter (\"Saving Grace\") and Kyra Sedgwick (\"The Closer\"). A number of familiar names were included among nominees for comedies. The nominees for best actor in a comedy are Alec Baldwin (\"30 Rock\"), Steve Carell (\"The Office\"), Lee Pace (\"Pushing Daisies\"), Tony Shalhoub (\"Monk\") and Charlie Sheen (\"Two and a Half Men\"). Only Pace is a newcomer. The nominees for best actress in a comedy are Christina Applegate (\"Samantha Who?\"), America Ferrera (\"Ugly Betty\"), Tina Fey (\"30 Rock\"), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (\"The New Adventures of Old Christine\") and Mary-Louise Parker (\"Weeds\"). Sarah Silverman earned three nominations, all for different programs: one for a guest shot on \"Monk,\" another for contributing to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and a third for producing her own \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\" Kristin Chenoweth, Neil Patrick Harris and TV academy Chairman John Shaffner announced the nominations Thursday. Chenoweth was particularly bubbly, throwing in a non sequitur about once dating \"Survivor\" host Jeff Probst and declining to sing \"Happy Birthday\" because \"the Emmys can't afford me to sing that song\" due to licensing arrangements. Both Chenoweth (\"Pushing Daisies\") and Harris (\"How I Met Your Mother\") were nominated in supporting actor categories. Two highly rated shows, \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Desperate Housewives,\" were snubbed. \"Grey's,\" a regular nominee for best drama, was left off that list, though star Sandra Oh was nominated for best supporting actress. \"Housewives,\" which won six Emmys its debut season, was ignored in both best comedy series and best actress in a comedy series categories. Two guest stars did receive nominations. Stephen Colbert, nominated for individual performance in a variety or musical program, put everything in perspective. \"What an honor, unless I don't win,\" he told the AP.

Spent a lot of time there. \nI've been on the third step for over five months and it feels like I'm wasting time and maybe even regressing on the whole. \nThis step feels like kneeling pushups in that it doesn't really contain any core movement of the exercise I'm trying to develop. The next step does, and I attempted half pullups for the first time earlier and could hardly manage 4 reps. Weak! Was having trouble getting chin to bar. Also it focuses on the upper half of the pull, sort of makes more sense to start with\n\nText continuation:\n.\nI've been thinking about it a lot and I'm starting to wonder if I should just skip this step and move on to the next one. But at the same time, I don't want to give up on the progress I've made so far. I've been doing these assisted pull-ups with resistance bands and it's been helping me build up some strength, but it's not the same as doing a real pull-up.\nI've also been trying to focus on my form and engagement during these assisted pull-ups, but it's hard to tell if I'm doing it right. I feel like I'm using my legs and hips more than my arms and back, which is probably not the most effective way to build up my pull-up strength.\nI've been thinking about trying to mix up my routine and add some other exercises that target the same muscle groups as pull-ups, like rows and lat pulldowns. Maybe that will help me build up some strength and momentum and get me back on track with the pull-up progression.\nAnother thing I've been considering is trying to incorporate some isometric holds into my routine. I've heard that isometric exercises can be really effective for building up strength and endurance, and it might be a good way to target the muscles I need to build up for pull-ups.\nI've also been thinking about trying to incorporate some plyometric exercises into my routine. Plyometric exercises are exercises that involve rapid, powerful movements, and they can be really effective for building up strength and power. Maybe doing some plyometric pull-ups or assisted pull-ups with a rapid, explosive movement could help me build up some strength and momentum.\nI know it's easy to get frustrated and disheartened when you're not seeing the progress you want, but I'm trying to stay positive and focused. I know that it's normal to hit plateaus and setbacks, and I'm just going to keep working at it and see what happens.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"l\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "1", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Also it focuses on the upper half of the pull, sort of makes more sense to start with\n\nText continuation:\nthe bottom half no?\nI don't know, I don't know how to proceed now but I really want to get on with pullups! I feel like I'd struggle to get a single deadhang pullup right now. Means I've gone backwards in a year. I know CC is meant to be helping with base strength and all at first but... does this make sense? I think if I wasn't doing grip training deadhangs I wouldn't even be able to hang off a bar. \nWould appreciate advice. Either put my head down and continue building reps with CC step  (I'm currently up to about 19 on the first set, 12 on the second. At my current rate I'd estimate I'll take another 4-5 months to reach progression standard) or move to a better more useful progression - if so what?\nhybridchildren: Hey, don't be disheartened, man! I've spent over 1 year stuck on some exercise then suddenly progress super fast once I discovered the weakness in my training. I'm confident you can do it too.\nSo let me get this straight; you could do 3-4 full pull ups before doing CC? If so, why not start at level 5 instead of level 2? I'm guessing I'm misunderstanding you.\nAnyway, like m092 says, my suggestion is to practice negatives to build up strength to reach full pull ups. I don't know how dedicated you are to CC, but I also suggest you abandon it (AT LEAST for pull ups; you can work on the other big 6 if you like) in favor of a different progression method. Depending on your goals, I think you can achieve full PU and OAPU following a simpler path. \nSo here's what I'd do if I were you. \n#1 do (or build up to) 3x5 sets of FULL, slow negatives for your PU training. No more jack knife pulls. \n#2 I don't know the rest of your workout, but if this is an important goal, put the negatives in the beginning of the workout. \n#3 Once you are more confident with your negatives, give PUs a shot again. If you can do 1 set of 3 reps, I'd say thats enough to move on from negatives and start training PUs themselves. Work up to 3x5 again.\n#4 If you have spare weight in the form of fat, focus on losing some of it through healthier/reduced eating. This will not only help your PUs but all other BW exercises.

with 15,000 members.\nPensions expert John Ralfe said Peugeot owner PSA would not want to touch it \"with a barge pole\", saying he thought it had a deficit of about \u00a31bn.\nHalf of the members were pensioners, Mr Ralfe told the BBC's Today programme.\nThe proposed sale will be discussed in the Commons on Monday afternoon after the Speaker granted an urgent question on the matter to the Labour MP for Ellesmere Port and Neston, Justin Madders.\nMeanwhile a Downing Street spokesman confirmed that Prime Minister Theresa May was planning to meet Carlos Tavares, PSA chief executive, but a time and date for the meeting had not yet been fixed.\nAccording to company filings to the end of 2014 - the latest available - the Vauxhall pension scheme had assets of about \u00a31.8bn but liabilities of about \u00a32.6bn, leaving a deficit of \u00a3840m.\nSince then record low interest rates have hit the returns on government debt in which big pension schemes invest heavily, so the deficit had probably grown, Mr Ralfe said.\nLast week it emerged that PSA Group, which also makes Citroen cars, was in talks about taking over GM's loss-making European business, Opel.\nMr Ralfe told Today the size of the deficit was a \"major issue for the takeover\". \"At best it's a stumbling block, at worst it could be a deal breaker,\" he said.\nHe said he was clear that PSA would not want to take on the pension scheme so they would only buy the operating assets, including the plant and the Vauxhall brand, leaving the pensions with General Motors UK.\n\"The trouble with that is that would then be a company with no assets, so what would have to happen ... is that General Motors US would have to issue a guarantee for that UK company,\" Mr Ralfe said.\nPSA, which already works with GM in Europe on several projects, said a takeover was among \"numerous strategic initiatives\" being considered.\nAny deal would involve Opel's UK arm, Vauxhall, which employs 4,500 staff at plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton.\nUnite union leader Len McCluskey is also due to meet Mr Tavares this week to discuss the deal and any impact it might have on jobs.\nMr Ralfe said he did not think the Vauxhall pensioners needed to be worried about their position, but said that while politicians were \"running around all over the place asking about jobs, they should also be running around asking about pensions\".\n\nSummary:\nThe proposed takeover of Vauxhall by PSA Group may be at risk due to a \u00a31 billion pension scheme deficit, which could be a \"deal breaker\" or a \"stumbling block\"

Are you adding it as a decoration?  Trying to make it an eye catcher?\nJust remember that anyone looking at the head will be staring into the light which may make it less appealing to look at rather than more appealing if you end up putting it on the front like your image shows.\nNow, if you are going the route of lighting the object, then you need to use some sort of directed light that is at least partly shielded from the person viewing it (so they don't look like a deer in headlights either).\nIf you are going decoration aspect, consider NOT putting it on the front.  Put it around the edge\n\nText continuation:\n...\nYou know, I think Wolfiesden has a point. If the purpose of the LED strip is to illuminate the animal head, it might be more effective to place it in a way that creates a subtle glow rather than a harsh, direct light. Maybe you could try placing it around the edges of the plaque or along the contours of the animal's body. This would create a soft, ambient light that adds depth and interest to the overall design without being too overpowering.\nAnother option would be to use a diffuser to soften the light emitted by the LED strip. This could be a transparent or translucent material that is placed over the strip to scatter the light and reduce its intensity. This would help to create a more subtle, even illumination that wouldn't be too overwhelming.\nOf course, if you're looking to make the LED strip more of a decoration, Wolfiesden's suggestion to place it around the edge of the plaque is a great idea. This would create a nice, subtle border that adds visual interest to the overall design without being too distracting. You could also consider using a different color or pattern for the LED strip to match the overall aesthetic of the plaque and animal head.\nUltimately, the key is to experiment and find the right balance between light and shadow. By playing around with different placements and intensities, you should be able to find a solution that works for your specific needs and creates a visually appealing display.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"r\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "a"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Are you adding it as a decoration?  Trying to make it an eye catcher?\nJust remember that anyone looking at the head will be staring into the light which may make it less appealing to look at rather than more appealing if you end up putting it on the front like your image shows.\nNow, if you are going the route of lighting the object, then you need to use some sort of directed light that is at least partly shielded from the person viewing it (so they don't look like a deer in headlights either).\nIf you are going decoration aspect, consider NOT putting it on the front.  Put it around the edge\n\nText continuation:\n.  Think Bar rope lights.\nIf you are going eye-catcher but want subtle, don't put it on the front.  Make the mount so it stands off the wall an inch or so and angle the led strip outward and back so it illuminates the WALL around the plaque.  That would draw attention to it but not make it an in-your-face light making it hard to look into.  Here is the wall effect I am thinking:\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/01/a4/a7/01a4a71296c19077fe300113f7fe0eb5.jpg\n\nAnother option is to edge light plexi.  You would put a plexiglas plate between the head and the wood plate and edge light the plexiglass.  The plexi could be routed (standard router) with a design or if you have a laser cutter, plexi is extremely easy to cut and etch, expecially with a CO2 laser.  Mine cuts very quickly and etches very well.  Here is an edge lit sign to get an idea:\nhttp://www.valleydesignsnd.com/catalog/images/products/ac10212015_2.jpg\nAnother option to look at is tossing the LED thing and looking at EL wire.  Its very flexible, easy to work with and isn't extremely intense like LED is.  Is more of a subtle but distinctive look.  Doesn't put out much light so won't do anything for lighting up your head.  But for eyecandy effects, its hard to discount.  Its soft and flexible enough to be woven into clothes and has been used in halloween costumes for quite a few years now.  Here is an example off google (not endorsing this site, just has a decent pic): \nhttps://glowproducts.com/media/catalog/product/cache/5/thumbnail/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/e/l/el_wire_kits_gp2.jpg\nYusunoha: Thank you for your reply and all the information. \nTo quickly summarize the project that I have in mind, I have a giraffe animal head that I want to put on a plaque, and make it look like the imguraffe. Imgur is about the color green, so I had the idea of adding LED's to the plague that you can set to green.\nThe effect what I'm trying to go after though is having the head be illuminated in a dark room. Having the back of the plague is an option I considered, but I wanted to focus the light on the head than rather on the plague. And by diffusing the light you will not be directly staring into the light.\nI had not considered the edge lit option, I'll take it into consideration, but I think it may be a step too far for me.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Sweden\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I thought that would be the key to unlocking the door to a relationship. But still, nothing.\nI started to realize that it wasn't just about me, it was about finding someone who shared similar interests and values. So, I started attending events and gatherings where I could meet new people. I joined clubs and groups that aligned with my passions, and slowly but surely, I started to build connections.\nIt wasn't easy, and there were still times when I felt like I was stuck in a rut. But I didn't give up. I kept pushing forward, and eventually, I started to see progress. I met people who shared my interests, and we started to form meaningful connections.\nOf course, it's not like I suddenly became a social butterfly overnight. It took time, effort, and patience. But I learned that it's okay to take things at your own pace, and that it's not about trying to fit into someone else's mold. It's about being true to yourself and finding people who accept and appreciate you for who you are.\nSo, to anyone who's feeling like they're stuck in a rut, I'd say don't give up. Keep pushing forward, and don't be afraid to try new things. You never know who you might meet or what experiences you might have. And who knows, you might just find yourself feeling like you're finally a part of the world, even if it's just for a moment.\nAs for me, I'm still on this journey, and I'm still learning. But I'm no longer feeling like I'm stuck in a rut. I'm feeling hopeful, and I'm feeling like I'm finally starting to experience the world in a way that feels real and meaningful.

Upgraded my wardrobe to slim fit clothing.\nAll within 1 year.\nThere is dating game but I\u2019d complete the above before getting into that.\nGot a ton of tinder dates after I attained what I found ideal. Eventually my mentality turned from \u201cwhat do girls like?\u201d To \u201cwhat do I like? Who do I want to be?\u201d. While maintaining the above. \nBack to you, do you follow the above? \nBarcaLiverpool: What is the dating game and how do you change mindset of being shy \nearthgarden: shyness stems from low self-esteem combined with being self-centered.\nRaise your self-esteem and you will no longer be shy nor so intensely focused on yourself. When you feel good about yourself, you don't think negatively about yourself and thus you'll stop assuming others view you or will view you in a negative light. And if they do, so what you'll have the emotional stability to deal with someone rejecting you or not liking you.\nTo start raising your self-esteem, write down good things about yourself. Listen to the people who love you and who've been there. For example don't discount good things your mom or grandma has to say about you, they're not just saying it because.\nBarcaLiverpool: Very well said!\nI have made several significant changes in my lifestyle in order to better myself. I go to gym 4-5 days a week, have set meal plan, focused on hygiene, began reading books instead of surfing through internet \nBut even after these improvements I still have low self esteem. I can\u2019t/don\u2019t know how to change that. I frequently look at the mirror or take selfie to \u201ccheck myself out\u201d to see if I\u2019m okay. \nHow do I raise self esteem and build confidence? I know how to make lifestyle changes, it\u2019s the mindset change that\u2019s the problem for me \nHats_back: Did you make the changes in order to better yourself for you, or better yourself in the hopes of finding chicks? I found that focusing on yourself and making your life good without companionship is the key to finding companionship. You need to be self sufficient and happy with your own life to ever attract another healthy person who is okay with theirs! \nAll I can say is fake it \u2018til you make it. If you aren\u2019t confident then act like it anyways, feels natural after a while lol. \nBarcaLiverpool: Wise words. It\u2019s as if i knew \u201cthe secret\u201d all along. I just needed to hear it from someone else. Thanks mate\nHats_back: Well I\u2019m happy it helped in any way it could. It\u2019s almost like \u201cthe secret\u201d is that there isn\u2019t a secret and you just have to do it. It\u2019s harder than it sounds, and sometimes it\u2019s lonely, but when you feel lonely you can make a conscious effort to do something new. Random things can spark passion and that passion can be a magnet for other people.

They say they like a certain musician, listen to that musician before the next time you see them so you can comment on that.  The easiest way to fake an interest in a person is not to fake it, genuinely look into what they are interested in.  \nIt doesn't even have to be something you like.  My friend is a football fan, and I fucking hate sports.  But I know the team she likes and the team she hates, and I put stuff from the team she hates on her desk at work.  Even if you do something annoying to tease a friend, at least do it in a way that shows you listen to what they say and see them.\nPhysical_Key_4041: so with the musician example say I listen to a band they recommend, how would I then comment about that band in the follow up conversation\nlike for example I like avatar the last air bender (show) yet even if I meet someone else who likes the show I wouldn\u2019t know how to talk about it with them, like do I just say \u201cI liked the band you recommended\u201d surely not that ain\u2019t really a convo, so like say I listen to the band they recommend, how would I then discuss that band with them \nor take avatar the last airbender how would I discuss the show with someone that\u2019s already seen it\nthe_entroponaut: That's an interesting question, because I guess if I said \"It will just flow from there\" then that wouldn't be helpful at all!  \nIt is tricky to answer though, because conversations are so dynamic that it is hard to apply programmatic rules to them.  I mean, I loved The Last Airbender, but it is hard to come up with cold topics about it.  Personally I might bring up themes of apotheosis in shows (though some people might think I'm pretentious for that, but I am pretentious so I guess that's just me).  Or how I really love that the series format can grant a long time for several character development arcs that a movie can't, evolving into a metal bender or a blood bender and such.  Basically you are going to go into some (but not exhaustive) detail about why you liked it, and your favorite parts, and find out theirs.\nAnd that guidelines applies to most topics.  Music talk tends to be a bit more shallow (unless you are a musician) than movie/TV talk.  It's usually along a format of \"I liked this band, it reminded me of this band, have you heard of them?\"  A finding common ground kind of thing.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Guyana\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

By pooling their resources and expertise, the participating companies aim to produce a staggering 10 million face masks per week, a significant increase from the current production capacity.\nThe manufacturing process will involve a complex supply chain, with raw materials being sourced from various suppliers, then spun into yarn, woven into fabric, and finally cut and sewn into masks. Parkdale Mills will serve as the lead manufacturer, with the other companies contributing their expertise in different stages of the production process.\nThe effort is being coordinated through the National Council of Textile Organizations, a trade association that represents the interests of the U.S. textile industry. The organization has been working closely with government agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to ensure that the face masks meet the necessary standards and are distributed efficiently to those who need them most.\nThe participating companies have also pledged to donate a portion of their production to local hospitals and healthcare facilities, recognizing the critical role that these institutions play in the fight against the pandemic. By providing these organizations with a steady supply of face masks, the textile industry is helping to ensure that medical professionals have the necessary equipment to care for patients and keep themselves safe.\nAs the production ramp-up begins, the participating companies are working around the clock to meet the demand for face masks. Parkdale Mills has already mobilized its workforce, with employees working extended shifts to meet the increased production requirements. Other companies are also diverting resources to support the effort, with some even setting up temporary manufacturing facilities to increase capacity.\nThe textile industry's response to the pandemic is a testament to the sector's resilience and adaptability. Despite the challenges posed by the crisis, the industry has come together to support the nation's healthcare system, demonstrating its commitment to the greater good. As the country continues to navigate the pandemic, the textile industry's efforts will play a critical role in protecting the health and well-being of Americans, and its contributions will be remembered as a shining example of the power of collaboration and determination.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"f\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "f"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "1", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "f"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Perhaps the focus would shift from the fetus's rights to the mother's autonomy and bodily integrity.\nIt's interesting to consider how societal attitudes towards pregnancy and childbirth have evolved over time. In many ancient cultures, women were seen as vessels for childbirth, and their bodies were often treated as mere containers for the growing fetus. This perspective has slowly changed, and today we recognize the importance of respecting a woman's right to make decisions about her own body.\nBut what about the moral implications of abortion? Do we truly believe that a fetus is a human being, deserving of the same rights and protections as a born individual? Or do we recognize that the moral status of a fetus is more complex, and that the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be left to the individual woman?\nUltimately, the debate around abortion is a deeply personal and emotional one, and it's difficult to find a clear-cut solution. However, by acknowledging the complexity of the issue and engaging in respectful dialogue, we can work towards creating a more compassionate and just society for all individuals, regardless of their gender or reproductive status.\nIn the end, the decision to have an abortion is a difficult one that should be made with careful consideration and respect for all parties involved. While it's impossible to know for certain what the moral status of a fetus is, we can strive to create a world where every individual, regardless of their age or stage of development, is treated with dignity and respect.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"h\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "b"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "b"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

When the population totals of some auxiliary variables are known and when the inclusion probabilities are known by design, survey statisticians have developed calibration methods for improving efficiencies of the inverse probability weighting estimators and the methods can be applied to missing data analysis. Model-based calibration has been proposed in the survey sampling literature, where multidimensional auxiliary variables are first summarized into a predictor function from a working regression model. Usually, one working model is being proposed for each parameter of interest and results in different sets of calibration weights for\n\nText continuation:\neach parameter.\nThese calibration weights can be used to adjust the estimated means and totals of the auxiliary variables to match the known population totals, thereby improving the accuracy of the estimates. The calibration process can also be used to account for complex survey designs, such as stratification and clustering, by incorporating these design effects into the working model. Furthermore, the calibration weights can be used to adjust for non-response bias by weighting the complete cases by the inverse of the non-response probability.\nIn addition to the model-based calibration, other calibration methods have also been proposed, such as propensity score calibration and density ratio calibration. These methods are based on different assumptions and can be used in different contexts, such as when the inclusion probabilities are unknown or when the auxiliary variables are not available. The choice of calibration method depends on the specific survey design and the nature of the missing data.\nThe calibration methods can be applied to various types of survey data, including cross-sectional and longitudinal data, and can be used to estimate a wide range of parameters, such as population means, totals, and proportions. The methods can also be used to adjust for non-response bias in complex surveys, such as those with multiple stages of selection and non-response. Overall, the calibration methods provide a powerful tool for improving the accuracy and efficiency of survey estimates, and can be used in a variety of applications, including health surveys, economic surveys, and social surveys.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"g\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

When the population totals of some auxiliary variables are known and when the inclusion probabilities are known by design, survey statisticians have developed calibration methods for improving efficiencies of the inverse probability weighting estimators and the methods can be applied to missing data analysis. Model-based calibration has been proposed in the survey sampling literature, where multidimensional auxiliary variables are first summarized into a predictor function from a working regression model. Usually, one working model is being proposed for each parameter of interest and results in different sets of calibration weights for\n\nText continuation:\nestimating different parameters. This paper considers calibration using multiple working regression models for estimating a single or multiple parameters. Contrary to a common belief that overfitting hurts efficiency, we present three rather unexpected results. First, when the missing probability is correctly specified and multiple working regression models for the conditional mean are posited, calibration enjoys an oracle property: the same semiparametric efficiency bound is attained as if the true outcome model is known in advance. Second, when the missing data mechanism is misspecified, calibration can still be a consistent estimator when any one of the outcome regression models is correctly specified. Third, a common set of calibration weights can be used to improve efficiency in estimating multiple parameters of interest and can simultaneously attain semiparametric efficiency bounds for all parameters of interest. We provide connections of a wide class of calibration estimators, constructed based on generalized empirical likelihood, to many existing estimators in biostatistics, econometrics and survey sampling and perform simulation studies to show that the finite sample properties of calibration estimators conform well with the theoretical results being studied.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Belarus\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

To investigate seismic wave amplification in such cases, past studies have been devoted to one-directional shear wave propagation in a soil column (1D-propagation) considering one motion component only (1C-polarization). Three independent purely 1C computations may be performed ('1D-1C' approach) and directly superimposed in the case of weak motions (linear behaviour). This research aims at studying local site effects by considering seismic wave propagation in a 1-D soil profile accounting for the influence of the 3-D loading path and non-linear hysteretic behaviour of the soil. In the proposed '1D-3C' approach, the three components (3C\n\nText continuation:\n) of the seismic motion are considered, allowing for the investigation of the soil's response to complex waveforms. By incorporating the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the non-linear behaviour of the soil, which is essential for understanding the local site effects and seismic wave amplification.\nThe '1D-3C' approach is particularly useful for studying the response of soil deposits to complex seismic waves, such as those generated by earthquakes or explosions. In these cases, the seismic waves may have multiple frequency components and polarizations, which can interact with the soil in complex ways. By considering the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the non-linear behaviour of the soil and provide a more accurate representation of the seismic wave amplification.\nIn addition, the '1D-3C' approach can be used to study the effects of soil non-linearity on seismic wave propagation. Soil non-linearity can arise from a variety of mechanisms, including the non-linear response of the soil to stress, the presence of cracks or fractures, and the interaction between the soil and other geological structures. By incorporating the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the non-linear behaviour of the soil and provide a more accurate representation of the seismic wave amplification.\nFurthermore, the '1D-3C' approach can be used to study the effects of site-specific conditions on seismic wave propagation. Site-specific conditions, such as the presence of a hard rock layer or a layer of loose soil, can significantly affect the response of the soil to seismic waves. By incorporating the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the effects of site-specific conditions and provide a more accurate representation of the seismic wave amplification.\nIn conclusion, the '1D-3C' approach is a powerful tool for studying local site effects and seismic wave amplification in soil deposits. By incorporating the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the non-linear behaviour of the soil and provide a more accurate representation of the seismic wave amplification. The approach can be used to study a wide range of problems, including the response of soil deposits to complex seismic waves, the effects of soil non-linearity on seismic wave propagation, and the effects of site-specific conditions on seismic wave propagation.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"s\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "s"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

This research aims at studying local site effects by considering seismic wave propagation in a 1-D soil profile accounting for the influence of the 3-D loading path and non-linear hysteretic behaviour of the soil. In the proposed '1D-3C' approach, the three components (3C\n\nText continuation:\n-polarization) of the incident wave are simultaneously propagated into a horizontal multilayered soil. A 3-D non-linear constitutive relation for the soil is implemented in the framework of the Finite Element Method in the time domain. The complex rheology of soils is modelled by mean of a multisurface cyclic plasticity model of the Masing-Prandtl-Ishlinskii-Iwan type. The great advantage of this choice is that the only data needed to describe the model is the modulus reduction curve. A parametric study is carried out to characterize the changes in the seismic motion of the surficial layers due to both incident wavefield properties and soil non-linearities. The numerical simulations show a seismic response depending on several parameters such as polarization of seismic waves, material elastic and dynamic properties, as well as on the impedance contrast between layers and frequency content and oscillatory character of the input motion. The 3-D loading path due to the 3C-polarization leads to multi-axial stress interaction that reduces soil strength and increases non-linear effects. The non-linear behaviour of the soil may have beneficial or detrimental effects on the seismic response at the free surface, depending on the energy dissipation rate. Free surface time histories, stress-strain hysteresis loops and in-depth profiles of octahedral stress and strain are estimated for each soil column. The combination of three separate 1D-1C non-linear analyses is compared to the proposed 1D-3C approach, evidencing the influence of the 3C-polarization and the 3-D loading path on strong seismic motions.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Fiji\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.\n\nSummary:\nPhotosynthesis is performed differently by different species but the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers that contain green chlorophyll (and other colored) pigments/chromophores. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.\nIn plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other bacteria, different mechanisms such as the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Eritrea\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Using Max Weber's ideal bureaucracy as outlined in the provided text, generate 5 pro and 5 con bullet points on how bureaucracy is applied to an organization in practice.\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary contains the letter \"t\".\n\nArticle:\nThe German sociologist Max Weber was the first to formally study bureaucracy and his works led to the popularization of this term. In his essay Bureaucracy, published in his magnum opus Economy and Society, Weber described many ideal-typical forms of public administration, government, and business. His ideal-typical bureaucracy, whether public or private, is characterized by:\n- hierarchical organization\n- formal lines of authority (chain of command)\n- a fixed area of activity\n- rigid division of labor\n- regular and continuous execution of assigned tasks\n- all decisions and powers specified and restricted by regulations\n- officials with expert training in their fields\n- career advancement dependent on technical qualifications\n- qualifications evaluated by organizational rules, not individuals\nWeber listed several preconditions for the emergence of bureaucracy, including an increase in the amount of space and population being administered, an increase in the complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out, and the existence of a monetary economy requiring a more efficient administrative system. The development of communication and transportation technologies makes more efficient administration possible, and democratization and rationalization of culture results in demands for equal treatment. Although he was not necessarily an admirer of bureaucracy, Weber saw bureaucratization as the most efficient and rational way of organizing human activity and therefore as the key to rational-legal authority, indispensable to the modern world. Furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalization of Western society. Weber also saw bureaucracy, however, as a threat to individual freedoms, and the ongoing bureaucratization as leading to a \"polar night of icy darkness\", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in a soulless \"iron cage\" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control Weber's critical study of the bureaucratization of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work. Many aspects of modern public administration are based on his work, and a classic, hierarchically organized civil service of the Continental type is called \"Weberian civil service\" or \"Weberian bureaucracy\". It is debated among social scientists whether Weberian bureaucracy contributes to economic growth\n\nSummary:\nPro:\nHierarchical organization allows for clear lines of authority and decision-making, reducing confusion and increasing efficiency.\nFormal lines of authority (chain of command) ensure that tasks are assigned and executed in a timely and organized manner.\nRigid division of labor allows for specialization and expertise, leading to higher quality work and increased productivity.\nRegular and continuous execution of assigned tasks ensures consistency and reliability, which is essential for many organizations.\nOfficials with expert training in their fields ensure that tasks are carried out with the highest level of competence and professionalism.\nCon:\nHierarchical organization can lead to rigidity and inflexibility, making it difficult to adapt to changing circumstances or respond to new challenges.\nFormal lines of authority (chain of command) can create bureaucratic red tape and slow down decision-making, leading to inefficiencies and frustration.\nRigid division of labor can lead to a lack of creativity and innovation, as employees may feel constrained by their specialized roles.\nRegular and continuous execution of assigned tasks can lead to a lack of accountability and\n\nDoes this summary contain the letter \"t\"?\nA) Yes\nB)

Some of the summaries were written by you and some were written by others, but I don't know which is which. The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Using Max Weber's ideal bureaucracy as outlined in the provided text, generate 5 pro and 5 con bullet points on how bureaucracy is applied to an organization in practice.\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary mentions the country \"Togo\".\n\nArticle:\nThe German sociologist Max Weber was the first to formally study bureaucracy and his works led to the popularization of this term. In his essay Bureaucracy, published in his magnum opus Economy and Society, Weber described many ideal-typical forms of public administration, government, and business. His ideal-typical bureaucracy, whether public or private, is characterized by:\n- hierarchical organization\n- formal lines of authority (chain of command)\n- a fixed area of activity\n- rigid division of labor\n- regular and continuous execution of assigned tasks\n- all decisions and powers specified and restricted by regulations\n- officials with expert training in their fields\n- career advancement dependent on technical qualifications\n- qualifications evaluated by organizational rules, not individuals\nWeber listed several preconditions for the emergence of bureaucracy, including an increase in the amount of space and population being administered, an increase in the complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out, and the existence of a monetary economy requiring a more efficient administrative system. The development of communication and transportation technologies makes more efficient administration possible, and democratization and rationalization of culture results in demands for equal treatment. Although he was not necessarily an admirer of bureaucracy, Weber saw bureaucratization as the most efficient and rational way of organizing human activity and therefore as the key to rational-legal authority, indispensable to the modern world. Furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalization of Western society. Weber also saw bureaucracy, however, as a threat to individual freedoms, and the ongoing bureaucratization as leading to a \"polar night of icy darkness\", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in a soulless \"iron cage\" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control Weber's critical study of the bureaucratization of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work. Many aspects of modern public administration are based on his work, and a classic, hierarchically organized civil service of the Continental type is called \"Weberian civil service\" or \"Weberian bureaucracy\". It is debated among social scientists whether Weberian bureaucracy contributes to economic growth\n\nSummary:\nPro:\n1. References are provided and checked to ensure candidates are qualified.\n2. Management priorities are completed by employees as soon as possible.\n3. \"Industry experts\" are welcome.\n4. Learning is rewarded and encouraged. Free training is provided. \n5. When warranted, a RACI (responsible,  accountable, consulted, and informed) is shared across departments. \nCon: \n1. \"Flat\" organizations with a \"startup\" culture generate new ideas since all employees feel like contributors.\n2. Dynamic and strategic roles are difficult to place into a fixed area of activity with a clear division of responsibilities.\n3. Decisioning via regulations assumes it is possible and efficient to document specified and restricted regulations in all cases. \n4. Bureaucracy is not \"fun\" and employee retention and well-being are critical aspects of any organization.\n5. Employee \"freedom\" motivates and inspires people to do their best work.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Togo\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The country's leaders, who once promised to bring about a socialist utopia, have instead presided over a dystopian nightmare.\nmihai2me: And what's worse is that the West is quick to point fingers and say \"I told you so\" while ignoring the fact that they themselves have played a significant role in destabilizing the country through economic sanctions and foreign interference.\nspeckz: The economic sanctions, imposed by the US and other Western countries, have had a devastating impact on Venezuela's economy, exacerbating the already severe shortages of food, medicine, and other essential goods. The country's currency has collapsed, and inflation has skyrocketed, making it impossible for ordinary Venezuelans to access basic necessities.\nmihai2me: And let's not forget the role of the US-backed opposition, who have been engaged in a violent campaign of sabotage and terrorism against the government, further destabilizing the country and creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.\nspeckz: Meanwhile, the international community has been largely silent on the issue, failing to condemn the US and other Western countries for their role in Venezuela's crisis. Instead, they have chosen to focus on the supposed \"humanitarian crisis\" caused by the Venezuelan government's alleged abuses, while ignoring the far more pressing issue of the economic sanctions and foreign interference that are exacerbating the crisis.\nmihai2me: It's a classic case of \"pick and choose\" when it comes to human rights and humanitarian crises. The West is quick to condemn the Venezuelan government for alleged abuses, but when it comes to their own role in destabilizing the country, they suddenly become silent.\nspeckz: The situation in Venezuela is a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked capitalism and the importance of finding a more equitable and sustainable economic model. It is also a testament to the power of propaganda and the ability of governments to manipulate public opinion through the media.\nmihai2me: And it's a reminder that the struggle for socialism is far from over. Despite the setbacks and failures, the ideals of socialism and Marxism continue to inspire people around the world to fight for a more just and equal society.\nspeckz: The people of Venezuela, who have suffered so much under the yoke of neoliberalism and imperialism, continue to hold on to their dreams of a better future, and it is up to us to support them in their struggle for a more just and equitable society.\nmihai2me: So let's not forget about Venezuela and the struggles of its people.

Hopefully there will be one some day that benefits all, not just the few.\nmihai2me: One solution would be getting vastly reformed education systems worldwide along with rooting out the profit motive entirely. \nGetting rid of ways for people to hoard resources and gain leverage over the other,getting rid of money and being able to own private property (personal property like cars, houses you use are a human right as well and wouldn't be touched) basically. Guaranteeing all physical needs of people as a human right and putting it into practice by using social centered education that would make people naturally motivated to do crucial jobs just for the sake of battering the community and vast automation for everything else. \nContrary to what capitalism would want you to think, what people really need isn't more shit and more money to be happy, as once you have enough to live comfortably that lifestyle becomes trivialised. People crave social interaction, status, recognition, they crave to educate and better themselves in any way possible through education, meditation, volunteering etc. Raising people to become wholesome, truly educated and mature people and not just jamming information in their heads would mean scrapping all current education models. \nA really well fleshed out vision of such a world is the work of the people from the venus project, started by a very wise industrial engeneer that spent the last 100 years of his life trying to teach people to see past the current system for a truly better world. \nseipounds: Great answer and I've read up and watched the Venus project stuff a long while ago. Thing is it went in the \"yeah right\" bucket as delusional, simply because the practicalities to get to that space and level of thinking are just not possible given my experience of what the majority of humanity are like.\nmihai2me: It's pretty much 80% education and nurture and many scientific studies have shown this. The fact that there are still stupid or ignorant people in the world is a direct proof that their parents and education systems were terrible in educating those people, not that some people are doomed to stupidity and ignorance from birth. \nIf people were raised to treasure and admire education, self improvement, intelligence, artistry from birth they will continue to have those values for the rest of their lives and shape their lives accordingly. If you raise people to treasure wealth, money, status and other vapid, worthless values, well... You get capitalism, corruption, global warming, mass extinctions, mass obesity and mass starvation. And nobody caring so long as they're still able to live their lives and keep hoarding shit, or hoping that one day they'll be able to, through hard work, luck, or immoral ways\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Mauritania\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says journalists don't serve the public if they push rumors. (CNN) -- Two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the Internet. One week before comedian Bernie Mac passed away, text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died. I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead. The rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times. What makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition. Then there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards. The story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging. Ultimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened. There has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\" Sorry, Rick, I disagree. The most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control. Running with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion. The rumors kept going and going\u00ad and when the story hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire. In one week, Bear Stearns was no more, and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the Wall Street behemoth. We should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story. The rules are simple: Either you have the facts or you don't. If you do, you run with the story. If you don't, you leave it alone. The National Enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront Edwards as he was leaving the Beverly Hills Hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair. Then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the Enquirer said was the child of the mistress. With other major media outlets turning up the heat, Edwards admitted the affair in an interview with ABC's Bob Woodruff. No media executive should be pulling his or her hair out, trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor. If they had, and the facts didn't support the rumor, then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more. We have an obligation to stick with the facts, and nothing else. And no matter what a blogger, Web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with, the day we choose to alter our standards, our credibility and integrity will be shot. In the end, as former ABC News anchor Max Robinson said in 1988, that's all we've got. Nothing is worth losing that, even getting the scoop on an affair involving a candidate whose political career is likely over. Roland S. Martin is an award-winning journalist and CNN contributor.

If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says journalists don't serve the public if they push rumors. (CNN) -- Two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the Internet. One week before comedian Bernie Mac passed away, text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died. I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead. The rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times. What makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition. Then there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards. The story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging. Ultimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened. There has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\" Sorry, Rick, I disagree. The most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control. Running with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns.

John Wallace and educated at Winchester House School, Haileybury College, 1881\u201386, and St Thomas's Hospital, London.\nAt St Thomas's he was a successively appointed house surgeon, senior obstetric house physician, surgical registrar and in 1897, resident assistant surgeon. During the Second Boer War (1899\u20131900) he volunteered to work at the Portland Hospital in Bloemfontein under Anthony Bowlby. \nAfter the war he returned to St Thomas's as an assistant surgeon and was in 1913 promoted to surgeon. He was also surgeon to the East London Hospital for Children.\nDuring the First World War he served in France as a consulting surgeon to the First\n\nText continuation:\nArmy, where he was responsible for the treatment of wounded soldiers. He was particularly known for his expertise in the treatment of shell shock, a condition that was poorly understood at the time. Despite the challenges of wartime medicine, Wallace continued to develop his skills and reputation, and was eventually awarded the OBE for his services.\nAfter the war, Wallace returned to London and resumed his position as surgeon at St Thomas's Hospital. He continued to work at the hospital for many years, becoming a respected figure in the medical community. In 1931, he was created a baronet, and he was also a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. Wallace was known for his kind and compassionate nature, and was beloved by his patients and colleagues alike. He retired from active practice in the late 1930s, but continued to work as a consultant until his death in 1944. Throughout his long and distinguished career, Wallace was a true pioneer in the field of surgery, and his legacy continues to inspire and influence medical professionals to this day.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"t\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "t"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "*"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "t"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

He then moved to Tennessee, where he established the town of LaFollette.

He then moved to Tennessee, where he established the town of LaFollette. His company, LaFollette Coal, Iron, and Railway Company, eventually employed more than 1500 people and was the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States.\nEarly life and education\nHarvey M. LaFollette was born in Primrose, Wisconsin. His first cousin, Robert Marion La Follette Sr., was three years old at the time and living on the adjoining farm. Harvey's father (also named Harvey M. LaFollette) was a farmer and served in local government both as sheriff and commissioner. When Harvey was two years old, his family relocated to join relatives in Thorntown, Indiana. Harvey's brother, William La Follette, was born shortly after they arrived in Indiana. When he was seven years old, his father was killed in an industrial accident while working on a piece of machinery in the flour mill he owned.\nYoung Harvey was always an avid reader, and after studying at the nearby Friends School and a short stint at Wabash College, he left for France, the land of his Huguenot ancestors, to continue his education. He studied in Paris at several institutions focusing on languages and civil engineering. He left Paris, travelling on foot and staying with peasant families to better understand the local dialects. He took additional courses in Germany and in Italy. He returned to Indiana in 1880 as a well-educated and travelled young man. He spoke five languages fluently.\nIndiana educator\nHe began teaching in the public schools as soon as he returned from abroad and became a school principal and a county superintendent before running for statewide office at the age of 28. He was elected to two terms as Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. In this job, he established a number of reforms as he standardized the textbooks and regularized the financial systems.\nLaFollette, Tennessee\nAlong with his youngest brother, Grant LaFollette, Harvey then moved some 400 miles (640 km) to the south and purchased more than 37,000 acres (150 km2) of land in the Tennessee mountains. He established and served as president and general manager of a company that eventually employed 1,500 people and became the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States. He built a railroad that allowed his product to be shipped. The town that grew up around his business venture was named LaFollette in his honor and became the county seat of Campbell County.\nPersonal life\nGlen Oaks\nHarvey built and lived in Glen Oaks, a 27\u2013room mansion in the center of LaFollette designed by Knoxville architect George Franklin Barber. The home on Indiana Avenue is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As his company grew, he traveled extensively and remained close to his extended family. During the glare of the Wisconsin governor's race of 1900, his mother and older brother and sister returned to Primrose with cousin Robert and other family members to visit the old log cabin where Harvey was born and to relive memories of the pioneering days of a half century earlier. During the next decade, Harvey and his wife were often in Washington, DC, visiting family members and meeting political allies. Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks was a friend from his younger days in Indiana. His brother and cousin both moved to the nation's capitol as members of Congress, and he visited them often. Later in his life, when the mines no longer produced and his business failed, he returned to his academic roots, corresponding with Abraham Lincoln scholar Louis A. Warren, who wrote The Lincoln and LaFollette Families in Pioneer Drama, a history of the Lincoln and LaFollette families on the Kentucky frontier in the years before Jesse LaFollette and Thomas Lincoln took their families across the Ohio River to settle in Indiana Territory.\nFamily\nHe was a member of the La Follette family. William La Follette was a younger brother. Robert M. La Follette Sr. was his first cousin. William Leroy LaFollette Jr. and Chester La Follette were nephews. Suzanne La Follette was a niece. Mimi LaFollette Summerskill was a grand niece. Her son was political leader Richard L. Wright. His only child, Warner Marion LaFollette, predeceased him. Harvey was visiting his brother, William, in Colfax, Washington when he died in 1929. Both he and William and other LaFollette family members are interred in the Colfax Cemetery in Whitman County, Washington.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Martinique\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Let me know if I missed something, Im sure its been discussed.\nJreced: Pretty much everyone on here is gonna recommend you just stick to the RR. It works just fine and there's plenty of ring exercises. I'll assume you've already considered that\n\nText continuation:\nI understand your concern, Jreced. You're right, the Rings Routine (RR) is a great resource and a solid foundation for ring training. However, I'm looking for something more comprehensive and advanced. I've already mastered the basics and want to take my training to the next level.\nAfter further research, I came across some other programs that caught my attention. One of them is the \"Ring Training\" program by Antraniks. It's a comprehensive guide that covers a wide range of exercises, including some advanced ones like the \"ring muscle-up\" and \"ring L-sit\". The program also includes a workout plan and progressive overload guidelines, which I find very helpful.\nAnother program that I'm considering is the \"Rings of Power\" by Dragon Door. This program is specifically designed for ring training and includes a variety of exercises that target different muscle groups. It also includes a workout plan and some advanced techniques for more experienced trainers.\nI'm also looking at the \"Overcoming Gravity\" program, which is a more holistic approach to training. It covers not only ring exercises but also other forms of strength training and conditioning. The program is designed to help you build overall strength and fitness, rather than just focusing on ring training.\nFinally, I'm considering the \"Body by Rings\" program, which is a more specialized program that focuses specifically on ring training. It includes a variety of exercises and a workout plan, as well as some advanced techniques for more experienced trainers.\nOverall, I'm looking for a program that will help me take my ring training to the next level and provide me with a comprehensive and well-rounded workout routine. I'm hoping that one of these programs will be the right fit for me.\nDo you have any experience with any of these programs, Jreced? Or do you have any other recommendations for me?

I'll assume you've already considered that\n\nText continuation:\nand want to do a different routine anyways. \n* Antraniks ring routine is geared towards strength and skill on rings. \n* Body by Rings is more geared towards hypertrophy.\n* Overcoming gravity will teach you how to make your own program with or without rings. This one requires the most thought.\n* I honestly wouldn't recommend anything by Dragon Door, that's just my opinion.\nAll are good resources, it just depends on your goals. Good luck choosing.\nBandatandWarrior: Do you mind if I ask why you wouldn't recommend anything by Dragon Door? I started using Convict Conditioning a month and a half ago and I'm seeing benefits. That said, I'm not the most athletic. I drank and smoked for years, so I'm gradually getting into body weight fitness. I'm genuinely curious though, as I've been doing it for such a short amount of time. I was going to supplement CC with the naked warrior as I heard good stuff. Any reasons why? I don't want to waste my money on an inferior product.\nThanks.\nJackofMA: If you choose to go Dragondoor, make sure you look at the Kindle versions on Amazon- not the PDF versions on the Dragondoor site. These are substantially cheaper than what is offered on the Dragondoor website for the paperback and for the Dragondoor PDF version. \nIn general, people are down on DD products because they are expensive with a lot of fluff. Full size pictures of one exercise when a smaller one would do. Huge margins and large type.\nThat being said- Naked Warrior is different from CC and may not offer what you are looking for. It focuses on techniques for tension to help you do one arm pushup and the pistol. Shows some progressions, but these boil down to manipulating height to make exercise easier. NW might help at the upper progressions of CC.\nWhether or not you get NW, do a search for Naked Warrior Bonus Material. One free pdf that comes up is for hanging leg raises. Pretty sure there is another one too. These are offered through the DD website, so it's not like you're downloading from some pirate site.\nBandatandWarrior: Thanks very much for the advice sir.\nAshamed to admit it but a month and a half in and I'm still on step one of the exercises. Since I turned 19 I let my fitness deteriorate badly. Only starting to get into it now as an outlet for my anxiety. Drives me crazy though because I boxed from 16 - 19 at an amateur level and used to be super fit. Anyway, thank you very much for taking time out of your day to comment.

Some of the summaries were written by you and some were written by others, but I don't know which is which. The instructions to the summary writer were: \"What are the main characteristics of a Haiku poem?\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary contains the letter \"c\".\n\nArticle:\nHaiku (\u4ff3\u53e5, listen (help\u00b7info)) is a type of short form poetry originally from Japan. Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases composed of 17 phonetic units (called on in Japanese, which are similar to syllables) in a 5, 7, 5 pattern; that include a kireji, or \"cutting word\"; and a kigo, or seasonal reference. Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified as senry\u016b.\nHaiku originated as an opening part of a larger Japanese poem called renga. These haiku written as an opening stanza were known as hokku and over time they began to be written as stand-alone poems. Haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.\nOriginally from Japan, haiku today are written by authors worldwide. Haiku in English and haiku in other languages have different styles and traditions while still incorporating aspects of the traditional haiku form.

Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases composed of 17 phonetic units (called on in Japanese, which are similar to syllables) in a 5, 7, 5 pattern; that include a kireji, or \"cutting word\"; and a kigo, or seasonal reference. Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified as senry\u016b.\nHaiku originated as an opening part of a larger Japanese poem called renga. These haiku written as an opening stanza were known as hokku and over time they began to be written as stand-alone poems. Haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.\nOriginally from Japan, haiku today are written by authors worldwide. Haiku in English and haiku in other languages have different styles and traditions while still incorporating aspects of the traditional haiku form. Non-Japanese haiku vary widely on how closely they follow traditional elements. Additionally, a minority movement within modern Japanese haiku (\u73fe\u4ee3\u4ff3\u53e5, gendai-haiku), supported by Ogiwara Seisensui and his disciples, has varied from the tradition of 17 on as well as taking nature as their subject.\nIn Japanese, haiku are traditionally printed as a single line, while haiku in English often appear as three lines, although variations exist. There are several other forms of Japanese poetry related to haiku, such as tanka, as well as other art forms that incorporate haiku, such as haibun and haiga.\n\nSummary:\nHaiku is a form of poetry which is composed of 17 syllables arranged in a 5 - 7 - 5 pattern.

Conrad Smith touches down for one of his two tries in the All Blacks win. Fullback Mils Muliaina scored three tries in the first half, center Conrad Smith and winger Richard Kahui touched down twice and nine other players added their names to the New Zealand scoresheet as the All Blacks beat a weakened Samoan team by a record margin. New Zealand led 47-7, seven tries to one, at halftime and added eight tries, including a penalty try, in the second spell to surpass their highest score against Samoa. The All Blacks had a 26-0 lead after 16 minutes and set their record score against Samoa -- surpassing the 71-13 in 1999 -- despite being held scoreless for periods of 18 minutes in the first half and 10 minutes in the second. It was the fifth time New Zealand had reached 100 points in a match, with the All Blacks' record being the 145-17 win over Japan at the 1995 World Cup. Samoa was forced to pick a severely under-strength side because many of its leading and most-experienced players are involved with European club sides. Most of the players who took the field Wednesday were young and Samoa-based and playing against the All Blacks for the first time. Although outgunned by an All Blacks team which overwhelmingly controlled territory and possession, Samoa played with great spirit and scored a try in each half. Flyhalf Uale Mai scored and converted his own try after 28 minutes and flanker Alafoti Faosiliva touched down off a break by Uale Mai four minutes before fulltime. \"What can you say? 100 points,\" Samoa captain Filipo Levi said. \"It shows the All Blacks are on fire at the moment. They've showed in the Tri-Nations competition that they're a very consistent team. \"For some of our boys it was a big step up from playing club rugby in Samoa but, having said that, it was a big learning curve.\" Flyhalf Daniel Carter converted six of the All Blacks' first-half tries, surpassing 2,000 points in first-class rugby, and his replacement Stephen Donald scored his first Test try and converted seven of New Zealand's eight second-half tries. The match was scheduled to help the All Blacks bridge the three-week gap between their most recent Tri-Nations clash with South Africa and their next, against Australia, at Brisbane on September 13. The Brisbane match will decide the outcome of the Tri-Nations tournament. Copyright 2008 CNN. All rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Gane stated that he had invited sole permanent NWW member Steven Stapleton to produce Stereolab's debut album (later released as Peng!). However, Gane stated that Stapleton had refused on the grounds that the group were \"too rock\" but had agreed to undertake a remix for the group instead. Stapleton surprised Gane by producing a letter he had written to NWW some years previously, which he had marked as the 15th\n\nText continuation:\n.\nThe letter, it seemed, was a challenge to the band to create a piece of music that would push the boundaries of their sound and challenge their audience. Stapleton, known for his experimental approach to music, wanted to see how far Stereolab would be willing to push themselves in response to his challenge. The result was Crumb Duck, a 10-minute piece of music that defied categorization and left listeners bewildered. The track featured a combination of distorted guitars, haunting vocals, and unconventional instrumentation, all woven together to create a sonic tapestry that was both challenging and captivating.\nDespite the initial shock of hearing Crumb Duck, Stereolab and NWW fans alike were drawn to the track's innovative sound and the way it seemed to blur the lines between different musical genres. The track's release on 10\" vinyl was a limited edition, but it quickly became a sought-after collector's item among fans of experimental music. Today, Crumb Duck remains a cult classic, a testament to the power of collaboration and the willingness of artists to take risks and push the boundaries of their creativity.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"m\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "1", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Stapleton surprised Gane by producing a letter he had written to NWW some years previously, which he had marked as the 15th\n\nText continuation:\npiece of correspondence he had received regarding his group (also The Wire, issue 164). According to a newsletter issued by Stereolab's Duophonic Records, part of the agreement was that Stereolab would not get to hear the finished results until after the record had been pressed and released.\"Exploding Head Movie\" is a Stapleton remix of a section of the 18-minute album version of the \"Jenny Ondioline\" single (as heard on Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements). \"Animal or Vegetable (A Wonderful Wooden Reason ......)\" saw Stapleton playing the vocal track in reverse and adding several layers of wild distorted guitar to the lengthy middle section before applying his familiar tape collage methods to the coda. The original version of this track has not been released. An homage to the German group Faust is provided by the subtitle to \"Animal or Vegetable\" \u2013 \"A Wonderful Wooden Reason.\" The latter references a line from the lyrics of \"Meadow Meal,\" a track on Faust's first album self-titled Faust (1971). Stapleton provided the distinctive cover image but around 30 copies came with sleeves hand drawn by members of Stereolab.\nStereolab later included both tracks on their Refried Ectoplasm compilation which remains in print. NWW, for their part, issued a Crumb Duck CD, adding 2 tracks from a 7\" single NWW had previously issued on the Clawfist label and an outtake. A vinyl edition of this expanded reissue was also made available but both formats went out of print when NWW's distributor, World Serpent Distribution, went out of business. NWW also included \"Animal Or Vegetable\" on their The Swinging Reflective compilation.\nThey would collaborate a second time in 1997 with the release of Simple Headphone Mind.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Oman\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I recently experienced not having anybody to talk to as it was really late at night (3-4 am), but really felt the need to do so as I was going through a crisis for a recent breakup, so I instead called the suicide hotline as I knew you can call them in case of non-emergency situations too. I talked to someone and they were super helpful and supportive and really helped me not feel alone.Towards the end of the call I asked them if there was an alternative solution as I didn\u2019t want to risk occupying a line in case\n\nText continuation:\nof a true emergency. They suggested the warm line, which is a non-emergency support service that connects you with a trained listener who can offer emotional support and guidance. I was skeptical at first, but they assured me that it was a safe and confidential space to talk about my feelings without worrying about interrupting someone who might be in a life-threatening situation.\nI decided to give it a try and was connected with a kind and compassionate listener who listened attentively to my story. It was amazing to feel like I was being heard and understood without judgment. We talked for about an hour, and I was surprised by how much better I felt after the call. It was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders, and I felt more grounded and centered. I realized that sometimes, all we need is someone to talk to, and that warm lines can be a valuable resource for those who are struggling. If you're going through a tough time and feel like you need someone to talk to, I highly recommend looking into warm lines in your area.

I recently experienced not having anybody to talk to as it was really late at night (3-4 am), but really felt the need to do so as I was going through a crisis for a recent breakup, so I instead called the suicide hotline as I knew you can call them in case of non-emergency situations too. I talked to someone and they were super helpful and supportive and really helped me not feel alone.Towards the end of the call I asked them if there was an alternative solution as I didn\u2019t want to risk occupying a line in case\n\nText continuation:\nsomeone in an emergency was trying to call, and they told me about the existence of \"warm lines\".

I lived in New Jersey in the USA, and I called the Mental Health Association in New Jersey,  Inc. at  [1-877-292-5588](https://www.mhanj.org/our-call-lines/).\nDo a search to find the one in your area. There is no limit to the number of times you can call or to what you can say. Speaking to someone who has been through what you're going through is like being cradled in true understanding. \n\nMental Health America has a good [list](https://screening.mhanational.org/content/need-talk-someone-warmlines/) of warmlines in the United States.\nelastic-craptastic: As a paranoid depressive, do they demand personal info?  I don't want a log kept on me without express permission.\nKimjongnacca: They make no intrusive demands of you. However, they need some personal info because they keep in touch. They do follow-up calls to make sure you're still OK later. They confer with each other to make sure you're being helped effectively. If they think you are a serious threat to yourself or others, they can send someone to help you; but it's almost exclusively just you having a conversation with an empathetic peer. \nBe well my friend.\nelastic-craptastic: I just don't wanna be a debbie downer to my friends but have no one that understands my personal struggles.   They are very specific, and though we all go through shit, I feel like my shit is pretty unique.\nBut I don't want my needing to bitch turn into a DSS case as I still take care of my family.  Mental health and stress has ruined families because they have asked for help, in my personal experience. I've seen it and it's better to shut up and suffer than deal with them.\nKimjongnacca: A warmline sounds like an excellent outlet for you.\nelastic-craptastic:  \nThanks for the input.

But she wasn't looking for the perfect safari lodge. She was hunting for the right cosmetic surgeon. When she told her family, it wasn't an easy sell. \"South Africa? You're going to get some kind of witch doctor,\" she recalls her father saying. \"But I told him they perfected some of the first heart surgeries down there. To me, South Africa had the most reputable surgeons.\" Hiltbrunner, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, traveled to Johannesburg in 2004 for a face-lift, upper arm lift and eyelid surgery. And she and her husband -- who hadn't taken a vacation in 20 years -- went on a luxury safari, included in the package by medical-travel agency Surgeon and Safari. \"Medical tourism\" may sound strange, but patients are discovering they can get some cosmetic surgeries abroad for less than the U.S. price. And many surgeries include sightseeing packages. The roster of countries in which hospitals and surgeons are marketing their services to foreigners is growing. South Africa, Argentina, Thailand, Brazil, Costa Rica, India and Singapore have become major players. Robert Painter, a travel writer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, journeyed last year to Argentina for dental surgeries -- and tango lessons: \"If I'm going to be stuck somewhere for two weeks at a time, twice, Buenos Aires has got to be the best possible place,\" he says . Painter's procedures were organized by Plenitas, a medical-travel facilitator in Buenos Aires, which booked him at a hotel with a dance studio in the back. He wasn't the only guest getting surgery: \"While I was there, there was a young lady who was also having implants -- though not of the dental type.\" Cost-cutting pros and cons . Cosmetic, or elective, procedures aren't covered by insurance, so cost remains the motivating factor for most medical tourists. Surgeries in many countries cost half or even one-fifth what they would in the U.S. -- including airfare, hotel and excursions. \"A full face-lift that would cost $20,000 in the U.S. runs about $1,250 in South Africa,\" a 2005 article in U-Daily, the University of Delaware's online news service noted. Faith Richter, of Hope Sound, Florida, got a face-lift in Bangkok, Thailand. Her trip was organized by New York City's Med Journeys. \"In the U.S., it would have cost $20,000 for the procedure alone, with no time in the hospital,\" she says. In Bangkok, Richter was in the hospital four days, and the total cost of her 19-day trip, including sightseeing and airfare for two, was $10,600. Painter estimates he saved $18,000 on his surgeries. \"Cost was the primary factor,\" he says. \"The only factor.\" Medical costs abroad are less than in the U.S. for many reasons -- favorable exchange rates, lower salaries and fewer medical lawsuits, which means lower malpractice-insurance costs. But the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery warns against low-cost surgery. \"Get bargains on your shoes and laundry detergent, not on your face,\" says spokesman Tony Staffieri. \"Researching the quality of doctors should be a patient's primary consideration, but it isn't always,\" he says. \"Some people think 'tummy tuck and shopping.' This is not makeup; it's somebody cutting you.\" Some medical professionals fear that patients will overlook the severity of invasive surgeries and fail to ask the right questions. More casual attitudes toward plastic surgery -- spurred by lunch-break Botox treatments and same-day liposuctions, paired with temptingly cheap alternatives and vacation packages -- increase the risk of bad outcomes. Even stateside, cosmetic surgery can have tragic results. \"First Wives Club\" author Olivia Goldsmith died during a chin-tuck in 2004, and this year Kanye West's mother, Donda, died after a tummy tuck and breast reduction. However, a 2004 study published in the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, found that \"deaths occurring at office-based surgery facilities (in the U.S.) are rare -- less than a quarter of a percent.\" Quality surgeons . Medical tourism experts counter criticism by saying that cheaper prices don't necessarily mean lower quality of care. \"In general, it is the hospitals and facilities that have justifiable claim to 'world-class' status or to meeting or exceeding U.S. standards that are competing for patients from the United States and other countries,\" says Jeff Schult, author of \"Beauty from Afar: A Medical Tourist's Guide to Affordable and Quality Cosmetic Care Outside the U.S.\" The authors of a 2006 \"New England Journal of Medicine\" article confirm the high standards of internationally accredited hospitals: \"We doubt (...) that the average U.S. hospital can offer better outcomes for common complex operations.\" \"Almost 80 percent of the doctors we use have been trained in the U.S. or U.K.,\" says Tim Wallace, vice president of sales and marketing for Med Journeys. \"It gives the American consumer a degree of confidence.\" Richter, a registered nurse, agrees that standards are high abroad. \"After the surgery, the nurses were there for me 100 percent,\" she says. \"At home, we're so understaffed and overburdened, and inundated with paperwork.\" When Painter visited U.S. dentists, \"I felt like I was being processed for a home loan,\" he says. \"In Argentina, I had three dentists working on me at once.\" While medical tourism continues to increase in popularity, it's still not mainstream. When Richter left for Bangkok, she \"didn't tell a soul, not even my seven children, who are almost all in the medical field. They would have had a stroke. \"At Thanksgiving, though, they were all saying, 'You really do look good.'\" E-mail to a friend . LifeWire provides original and syndicated content to web publishers.

This is not makeup; it's somebody cutting you.\" Some medical professionals fear that patients will overlook the severity of invasive surgeries and fail to ask the right questions. More casual attitudes toward plastic surgery -- spurred by lunch-break Botox treatments and same-day liposuctions, paired with temptingly cheap alternatives and vacation packages -- increase the risk of bad outcomes. Even stateside, cosmetic surgery can have tragic results. \"First Wives Club\" author Olivia Goldsmith died during a chin-tuck in 2004, and this year Kanye West's mother, Donda, died after a tummy tuck and breast reduction. However, a 2004 study published in the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, found that \"deaths occurring at office-based surgery facilities (in the U.S.) are rare -- less than a quarter of a percent.\" Quality surgeons . Medical tourism experts counter criticism by saying that cheaper prices don't necessarily mean lower quality of care. \"In general, it is the hospitals and facilities that have justifiable claim to 'world-class' status or to meeting or exceeding U.S. standards that are competing for patients from the United States and other countries,\" says Jeff Schult, author of \"Beauty from Afar: A Medical Tourist's Guide to Affordable and Quality Cosmetic Care Outside the U.S.\" The authors of a 2006 \"New England Journal of Medicine\" article confirm the high standards of internationally accredited hospitals: \"We doubt (...) that the average U.S. hospital can offer better outcomes for common complex operations.\" \"Almost 80 percent of the doctors we use have been trained in the U.S. or U.K.,\" says Tim Wallace, vice president of sales and marketing for Med Journeys. \"It gives the American consumer a degree of confidence.\" Richter, a registered nurse, agrees that standards are high abroad. \"After the surgery, the nurses were there for me 100 percent,\" she says. \"At home, we're so understaffed and overburdened, and inundated with paperwork.\" When Painter visited U.S. dentists, \"I felt like I was being processed for a home loan,\" he says. \"In Argentina, I had three dentists working on me at once.\" While medical tourism continues to increase in popularity, it's still not mainstream. When Richter left for Bangkok, she \"didn't tell a soul, not even my seven children, who are almost all in the medical field. They would have had a stroke. \"At Thanksgiving, though, they were all saying, 'You really do look good.'\" E-mail to a friend . LifeWire provides original and syndicated content to web publishers.

And just like her chart career, her marriage to Carl Dean turned 50 this year.\n\"I thought, well, this would be a good year to write an album of love songs,\" she says. \"I've never done that before. I've usually had a story song or a gospel song, but this was all love stories.\"\nThe BBC caught up with the star to discuss the new record, her legendary Glastonbury set, and why she admires Adele.\nFirst of all, congratulations on celebrating your golden wedding anniversary!\nThank you so much. That's a long time to do anything, ain't it? Especially to be married.\nWhat's the secret?\nWe've always been good buddies. We have a lot of fun and a lot of respect for one another. It was his first marriage and mine and we never thought we'd ever want to do that again. Why bother?\nYou renewed your vows earlier this year. What was that like?\nThat was sweet. There was no pressure at all. We had our own little ceremony in a little chapel on our property, then we went in our little RV down to Ringgold, Georgia, and spent the night where we had married 50 years before. We took some beautiful pictures and got all dressed up. It was fun really.\nDid you wear your original wedding dress? Could you still fit into it?\nWell, I could but I don't know where it is now! I only had a simple little white dress that my mother had made for me for that wedding, but I had always wanted a beautiful, long, beaded wedding gown, so I dressed completely to the nines. I made a right nice bride!\nThat sense of romance permeates your new album.\nOh yes! In fact a lot of the songs were written just because of that.\nYou've written so many love songs over the years - how do you find new ways to talk about it?\nLove is always growing, and we grow as people as well, so you just automatically take on new twists and turns. And it's amazing. I've always been amazed by that myself, how people can just write, year in and year out, about love and it all is different. I could write one right now!\nHow often do you write?\nI write something almost every single day unless I'm sick or on a movie set.\nIs that ever an inconvenience? Do you ever find yourself going, \"I don't have time to write a song right now, I need to finish this casserole?\"\nWell, no! In fact, I write a lot when I cook. If my cooking's really good that day, my songs are really good.\nIn Head Over High Heels, you sing about \"painting my eyes like Adele.\" What made you write about her?\nEveryone loves Adele. With all my little nieces, it's all \"Adele this\" and \"Adele that!\" And I love how she does her make-up, and so I'm always saying to my little nieces, \"can you fix my eyes like Adele?\"\nWhen I started that song, I had not planned to write that line. I was just thinking, \"This needs to be about a girl dressing up sexy, so she's got to have some make-up, and she's got to paint her eyes\". And all of a sudden it's like, \"And my eyes like Adele!\"\nWhat do you think her reaction will be?\nI think she'll have to be complimented, just like I'm always complimented when people write songs about me!\nI just meant I wanted to look like Adele. I hope she thinks it's cute.\nYou both like to talk to your audience in between songs, but she swears a lot more than you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I wondered what you made of that?\nOh, I don't pay any attention to that! Words are just an exchange, like money. I don't think the Lord holds that against us. I think that's just the way we communicate. And some people are just born cussers.\nWhat's the worst thing you've ever said on stage?\nOh, I've never said anything real bad. I try to respect the audience.\nThe song I'm 16 is based on one of your sisters, is that right?\nYeah, she had a couple of bad relationships and she thought it wasn't meant for her to have true love. Then all of a sudden, in her 60s, she met someone and they fell in love, and it's just like they were born again. It's just the sweetest thing.\nAnother one of my sisters and I were laughing. We said, \"Look at her, she thinks she's 16!\" and all of a sudden I heard the song in my head.\nGoes to show you're never old unless you choose to be.\nWhat age do you think of yourself as?\nI'm 16 in some ways. I'm still a hopeless romantic! But I'm 35 in my spirit and in my mind. When I was 35, it was a pinnacle, a great time in my life - success and happiness and all that. And so I just decided \"I'm gonna claim that number and always be that in my state of mind.\"\nWhat inspired Can't Be That Wrong?\nThat was an easy one to write. I think it's the ultimate cheating song.\nI based it on someone very, very close to me, who was very much in love with the person at home, and their children, and they weren't looking for love, they just happened to fall for someone. They were so torn, because they loved both people. I saw the turmoil and the heartache, and how overwhelming and overpowering it was. And I just thought, \"That's a strong-ass love, right there\". You know, to be willing to go through all you have to, and put the other people through that. So I thought, \"wow, this would make a great song.\"\nThe last time I saw you on stage in the UK was at Glastonbury - and you've put that concert on this album as a bonus disc. What are your memories of it?\nThat'll be one of my greatest memories, actually. That'll be a real highlight in my career.\nI wasn't even certain about doing that show, because I didn't know if I was the type of artist that would fit in that type of a festival - because people are rowdy, they like to go dancing, and they like to drink and smoke and I thought, \"I wonder if they're even going to pay attention?\"\nAnd so, as soon as I went out and I saw the crowd and heard the roar, I thought, \"Ohhhh, my Lord, how did I miss this all these years?\"\nThey call that part of the day the \"legends slot\". If you were booking next year's Glastonbury, who would you put in there?\nI don't know. I hadn't even thought about it in those terms. Probably Adele.\nBut I'm not sure I'd do it again, because I don't know how I could ever top that.\nPure and Simple is out now on RCA Records.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.\n\nSummary:\nCountry music legend Dolly Parton releases her new album \"Pure & Simple\", featuring romantic songs inspired by her 50th wedding anniversary and her legendary Glastonbury performance.\n\nDoes this summary contain the letter \"c\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "C", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "C", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "C", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Criticism and discussion are much welcome.\njustsackpat: Would vegans welcome a world in which there are no livestock animals? \nAnimals such as cows, sheep &amp; chickens have been looked after &amp; selectively bred over thousands of years to provide humans with a product (food, fabric, fertiliser etc). The only reason they exist is to be of material use to Homo sapiens. It makes sense for humans to care for these animals, though I understand modern food production is blurred with profit margins, unfortunately. Most farmers genuinely care for the livestock they manage. \nWhy would anyone look after cows if they have no end use? Because they\u2019re cute? What a joke... The only way to totally end cruelty to cows is for there to be no cows at\n\nText continuation:\nall. But what about the consequences of such a drastic change? Would we be willing to sacrifice the livelihoods of millions of farmers and their families, not to mention the impact on the environment and the economy? \nIt's not as simple as just abolishing livestock, as it would have far-reaching effects on our entire food system. We would need to find alternative sources of protein and nutrients, which could lead to unintended consequences such as increased reliance on industrial farming methods or the exploitation of other animal species. \nFurthermore, the idea that animals exist solely for human use is a simplistic view that neglects the complex relationships between humans and animals. Many animals have evolved alongside humans, and their existence has shaped our cultures, societies, and environments. The loss of these species would not only be a tragedy for the animals themselves but also for humanity. \nRather than seeking to eradicate livestock, perhaps we should focus on reevaluating our relationship with animals and the way we produce and consume food. We could strive for more sustainable and humane farming practices, such as regenerative agriculture, which prioritizes soil health, biodiversity, and animal welfare. \nThis approach would not only benefit the animals but also the environment, as it would promote soil carbon sequestration, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase ecosystem resilience. It would also support local communities and small-scale farmers, ensuring that the benefits of food production are shared equitably. \nIn conclusion, while the idea of a world without livestock animals may seem appealing at first glance, it is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of the consequences. Rather than seeking to eradicate animals, we should work towards a more compassionate and sustainable food system that prioritizes animal welfare, environmental stewardship, and social justice.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"u\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "1", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Criticism and discussion are much welcome.\njustsackpat: Would vegans welcome a world in which there are no livestock animals? \nAnimals such as cows, sheep &amp; chickens have been looked after &amp; selectively bred over thousands of years to provide humans with a product (food, fabric, fertiliser etc). The only reason they exist is to be of material use to Homo sapiens. It makes sense for humans to care for these animals, though I understand modern food production is blurred with profit margins, unfortunately. Most farmers genuinely care for the livestock they manage. \nWhy would anyone look after cows if they have no end use? Because they\u2019re cute? What a joke... The only way to totally end cruelty to cows is for there to be no cows at\n\nText continuation:\nall. \nThe answer isn\u2019t to ban eating animals (though I do assert that some people/ countries eat too much poor quality &amp; cheap meat) popular culture needs to change. We all need to try to buy local &amp; welfare quality assured produce. \nThe death of an animal is not a big deal. Poor treatment of them while they are alive is.\nTinac4: &gt; The death of an animal is not a big deal. Poor treatment of them while they are alive is.\nHow universally do you apply this principle?\nConsider a hypothetical human society where a number of kids are raised under the best possible conditions.  All of them are happy and satisfied, until they are killed painlessly and without warning at the age of 15.  Is this ethical?  If not, what makes this scenario different?\n[deleted]: Depends on your definition of 'ethics'. I argue that it wouldn't be unethical to kill 'isolately'. To kill any living being is 'fine' as long as their death does not inflict suffering on other living beings. For example, to kill a calf would be 'wrong' because their mother would suffer by cause of their death.\nHowever, if said calf existed in isolation and their death did not cause emotional or physical harm on others \u2013 and the procedure was to be done painlessly \u2013 I can see no problem with their murder. It does not matter if it is an individual of our species or another's.\nTinac4: I personally disagree--I'm more of a preference utilitarian than a classical utilitarian--but I see where you're coming from.  It does seem to me that your position leads to some unintuitive results, though.  For instance, if you came across a sleeping homeless man, you had a method to kill him painlessly and take his money, and you knew with certainty that nobody would care about or notice his death, would it be ethical to kill him?  (Obviously, this involves a lot of simplifications that don't apply in real life.)\n[deleted]: &gt; would it be ethical to kill him?\nI suppose we're having a mature discussion here so I'm going to answer honestly. Simply put, yes. But then again, that's according to MY definition of 'ethics' as I stated in the earlier comment.\nAs long as the procedure is done in a peaceful and painless manner, I really can't see how that would be a bad thing. It may help if I clarify that I'm an atheist who doesn't believe in afterlife, so to me death isn't anything gruesome.\nTinac4: Fair enough!  I think that the scenario you described would be bad, but only on the basis of my own ethical intuitions, and those intuitions definitely aren't universal.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Turkmenistan\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I've always sort of been quite curious what it would be like to get sprayed by a skunk - the smell of dead skunks on the highway has never bothered me much, so I've wondered what all the fuss is about. It came in a casual conversation with me and a (zookeeper) aquaintance last night, about how there's skunks in a local forest, and I mentioned that I was curious what it'd be like. He said he *strongly* recommended against it, but that, yes, it'd be easy to chase a skunk down there and get sprayed.\nMy reasons why I don't think it'd be so bad are as follows:\n1) It's just a smell. I don't see how a bad smell could be an effective animal defense.\n2) It lasts a long time, but I don\n\nText continuation:\n't think it'd be that unbearable. I mean, I've smelled some pretty strong smells before and managed just fine. A skunk's spray is probably just another variation of that.\n3) It's not like I'd be hurt or anything. I know skunks are generally harmless, and they're not going to attack me unless I'm threatening them. And even then, they'd probably just warn me off with a little spray instead of going full-on attack mode.\n4) I'm curious about the experience. I think it'd be kind of cool to know what it's like to be on the receiving end of that famous skunk smell. And who knows, maybe it'd even be a fun story to tell later.\nBut, I guess I could be wrong. Maybe getting sprayed by a skunk is way worse than I think it is. Maybe it's not just a smell, but a smell that's so overwhelming and unpleasant that it's actually traumatic. Maybe it's not just a temporary thing, but a smell that lingers for weeks or even months. Maybe it's not just a minor annoyance, but a major inconvenience that ruins my life for a while.\nI'm really hoping someone can talk me out of this. I'm curious about what you all think. Is getting sprayed by a skunk really that bad, or is it just a minor annoyance? Has anyone ever been sprayed by a skunk and lived to tell the tale? What was it like?

I don't see how a bad smell could be an effective animal defense.\nRemember that most animals are much more dependent on smell than humans are.  What might be inadequate defense against humans would be a stronger deterrent to a predator - not to mention interfering with its ability to smell for some time afterwards.  \n&gt;Yes, it apparently can cause blindness, but goggles would solve that problem.\nOr vomiting, or (rarely) hemolytic anemia.\n&gt;It lasts a long time, but I don't have work for 4 days.\nDo you have any social engagements during that time?  Are you an extreme introvert?  Most people would rather not stay home alone for days on end.  But you will be persona non grata in most social situations.\nyogofoxy: Well, yes, it would be worse for animals - but I'm a human, so I don't think that would be a huge concern.\nHow does it caught anemia, or vomitting? I haven't heard of that.\nFor the next 4 days I mostly had planned on relaxing anyways, during a rare vacation from work - so with regards to that, I don't think that's a concern either. Besides, I could wash the smell off somehow, I would think.\nGnosticGnome: The vomiting is from the stench; the thiols can for some people cause hemolytic anemia due to oxidative stress\nyogofoxy: I've never actually seen or heard of anyone vomit from a bad smell alone, except in cartoons. Is that a real-life thing? I can't even see any examples of it online.\nGnosticGnome: I've seen it happen in real life.  Yes, it's a thing.  Presumably the evolutionary benefit would be that we avoid eating spoiled food even when we're hungry because the smell makes us nauseated, and throw up contaminated food we've just eaten once we receive that olfactory data that it's likely too spoiled.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Djibouti\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary contains the letter \"g\".\n\nArticle:\nIn the Oracle RDBMS environment, redo logs comprise files in a proprietary format which log a history of all changes made to the database. Each redo log file consists of redo records. A redo record, also called a redo entry, holds a group of change vectors, each of which describes or represents a change made to a single block in the database.\nFor example, if a user UPDATEs a salary-value in a table containing employee-related data, the DBMS generates a redo record containing change-vectors that describe changes to the data segment block for the table. And if the user then COMMITs the update, Oracle generates another redo record and assigns the change a \"system change number\" (SCN).\nWhenever something changes in a datafile, Oracle records the change in the redo log. The name redo log indicates its purpose: If the database crashes, the RDBMS can redo (re-process) all changes on datafiles which will take the database data back to the state it was when the last redo record was written. DBAs use the views V$LOG, V$LOGFILE, V$LOG_HISTORY and V$THREAD to find information about the redo log of the database. Each redo log file belongs to exactly one group (of which at least two must exist). Exactly one of these groups is the CURRENT group (can be queried using the column status of v$log). Oracle uses that current group to write the redo log entries. When the group is full, a log switch occurs, making another group the current one. Each log switch causes checkpoint, however, the converse is not true: a checkpoint does not cause a redo log switch. One can also manually cause a redo-log switch using the ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE command.\n\nSummary:\nRedo logs in Oracle RDBMS are files in a proprietary format that log a history of all changes made to the database, allowing the database to be recovered in case of a crash.\n\nDoes this summary contain the letter \"g\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

A redo record, also called a redo entry, holds a group of change vectors, each of which describes or represents a change made to a single block in the database.\nFor example, if a user UPDATEs a salary-value in a table containing employee-related data, the DBMS generates a redo record containing change-vectors that describe changes to the data segment block for the table. And if the user then COMMITs the update, Oracle generates another redo record and assigns the change a \"system change number\" (SCN).\nWhenever something changes in a datafile, Oracle records the change in the redo log. The name redo log indicates its purpose: If the database crashes, the RDBMS can redo (re-process) all changes on datafiles which will take the database data back to the state it was when the last redo record was written. DBAs use the views V$LOG, V$LOGFILE, V$LOG_HISTORY and V$THREAD to find information about the redo log of the database. Each redo log file belongs to exactly one group (of which at least two must exist). Exactly one of these groups is the CURRENT group (can be queried using the column status of v$log). Oracle uses that current group to write the redo log entries. When the group is full, a log switch occurs, making another group the current one. Each log switch causes checkpoint, however, the converse is not true: a checkpoint does not cause a redo log switch. One can also manually cause a redo-log switch using the ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE command.\n\nSummary:\nIn Oracle RDBM, redo logs are the logs which are used to maintain the history of changes in a database. Each redo log linked to a data file has multiple redo records which hold group of change vectors. Redo logs can be used to apply the changes to Database in case of crashed and is also useful to create incremental backups.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Panama\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

NBA stars such as Kobe Bryant may soon be seen on a regular basis in Europe. The astonishing claims come hard on the heels of plans by the football's English Premier League to play matches overseas and underline the growing trend of globalization in major sports leagues. This was further evidenced by Super Bowl champions New York Giants playing a regular NFL season game against the Miami Dolphins at Wembley Stadium in London, but the NBA's leaked plans go far beyond that. A report on the Sports Illustrated Web site, says NBA commisioner David Stern will reveal his proposals on the eve of the All-Star Game in New Orleans this weekend. The plans are understood to include the formation of a European division with five new teams in major markets. The teams would play a full 82-game schedule and compete for the NBA championship. It is not the first time that Stern has entertained the concept of overseas expansion. He broached the idea in 2003, saying at the time that the league would look into European expansion within a decade. Those plans were scrapped, however, with the NBA instead focusing on developing its relationship with China and other emerging basketball markets. The number of European and overseas players has steadily increased in the NBA and basketball enjoys a particularly high profile in Spain, France, Italy, Greece and the Balkans. The NBA has played regular-season games in Japan and Mexico, and played exhibition contests this season in London and Rome. Meanwhile, Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant is doubtful for Sunday's All-Star game with a damaged finger. Bryant, who dislocated his right pinkie last week, scored 29 points in 35 minutes in Wednesday's 117-92 win at Minnesota. Bryant sat out the fourth quarter and had the finger X-rayed after the game.

NBA stars such as Kobe Bryant may soon be seen on a regular basis in Europe. The astonishing claims come hard on the heels of plans by the football's English Premier League to play matches overseas and underline the growing trend of globalization in major sports leagues. This was further evidenced by Super Bowl champions New York Giants playing a regular NFL season game against the Miami Dolphins at Wembley Stadium in London, but the NBA's leaked plans go far beyond that. A report on the Sports Illustrated Web site, says NBA commisioner David Stern will reveal his proposals on the eve of the All-Star Game in New Orleans this weekend. The plans are understood to include the formation of a European division with five new teams in major markets. The teams would play a full 82-game schedule and compete for the NBA championship. It is not the first time that Stern has entertained the concept of overseas expansion. He broached the idea in 2003, saying at the time that the league would look into European expansion within a decade. Those plans were scrapped, however, with the NBA instead focusing on developing its relationship with China and other emerging basketball markets. The number of European and overseas players has steadily increased in the NBA and basketball enjoys a particularly high profile in Spain, France, Italy, Greece and the Balkans. The NBA has played regular-season games in Japan and Mexico, and played exhibition contests this season in London and Rome. Meanwhile, Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant is doubtful for Sunday's All-Star game with a damaged finger. Bryant, who dislocated his right pinkie last week, scored 29 points in 35 minutes in Wednesday's 117-92 win at Minnesota. Bryant sat out the fourth quarter and had the finger X-rayed after the game.

I'm somewhere in between, in deep water, swimming to the other shore.\"\n\nSummary:\nWith his rich baritone voice, and songs that drew from his experience of poverty, heartache and restlessness, Merle Haggard was one of country music's most influential artists.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Bhutan\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In fact, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have both issued statements recommending limiting dietary intake of saturated and trans fats to reduce the risk of heart disease.\nFurthermore, the evidence is not just limited to observational studies, but also includes randomized controlled trials. For example, a 2014 meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 28%. Similarly, a 2016 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a low-fat diet reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 22% compared to a low-carbohydrate diet.\nIt's also important to note that the scientific community is not monolithic, and there is ongoing debate and discussion about the optimal dietary approach for heart health. However, the overwhelming majority of evidence suggests that reducing intake of saturated and trans fats is an important step in reducing the risk of heart disease.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"t\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "t"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "t"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "1", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "t"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The Texan family is trying to provide a more comfortable home and upbringing for these children. The Native American tribe is trying to preserve its culture. I don't fault the Texans for anything they're doing, except perhaps for the implicit assumption that a wealthier up-bringing is inherently superior to poorer childhood (wealth certainly is in advantage, but I don't think it's causally related to child happiness). I also don't fault the native American tribe for anything they're doing, with the history of explicit attempts to wipe out their cultural identity in the past. And in the middle, a brother and sister are separated by these two pulls.\nEdit: typos\n\nText continuation:\nAs the debate continues, it's essential to acknowledge the complex emotions and motivations involved. The Texan family, driven by a desire to provide a loving home, may not fully comprehend the cultural significance of preserving Native American heritage. Conversely, the Native American tribe, seeking to protect their children's cultural identity, may not fully grasp the emotional needs of the children themselves. Caught in the middle are the children, who are forced to navigate two vastly different worlds, torn between the comfort and security of their adoptive family and the cultural connection to their biological heritage.\nThe issue at hand is not solely about adoption or cultural preservation, but about the fundamental right of children to know and connect with their roots. The question remains: what is the best way to ensure that Native American children are able to grow up with a strong sense of identity and cultural connection? Should it be through adoption by a loving family, or through preservation of their cultural heritage within their own community?\nAs the debate rages on, it's crucial to remember that the fate of these children is not just a matter of legal or cultural significance, but also a matter of human compassion and empathy. The Texan family, the Native American tribe, and the children themselves all deserve our understanding, respect, and support.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"g\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "1", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The Texan family is trying to provide a more comfortable home and upbringing for these children. The Native American tribe is trying to preserve its culture. I don't fault the Texans for anything they're doing, except perhaps for the implicit assumption that a wealthier up-bringing is inherently superior to poorer childhood (wealth certainly is in advantage, but I don't think it's causally related to child happiness). I also don't fault the native American tribe for anything they're doing, with the history of explicit attempts to wipe out their cultural identity in the past. And in the middle, a brother and sister are separated by these two pulls.\nEdit: typos\n\nText continuation:\ncorrected\nlexabear: I fault the Texan family. I don't believe they're acting maliciously, but that doesn't mean that they can't be faulted. They assume that the only way to help these children is for *them* to take them away from their family and raise them themselves. \nSpecifically, this quote where the adoptive family discusses adopting the child's sister from the original family:\n&gt; I\u2019m a little bit concerned with the limited financial resources possibly to care for this child, should an emergency come up.\nAnother solution would be to *provide a better social net for the original family*, not just to take their children because they're poor. And yet that solution doesn't even seem to be on the table. \nTo say \"I have more money for you, so I can do a better job bringing up your children, so I should be able to take them\" is imperialism at its worst. Should a Russian oligarch have been able to just take me away from my parents, because they had more money?\ncrouching_tiger: But they aren\u2019t taking the child away from *his* family, they fostered the child after the state took him from his mother due to drug use.\nThey tried to adopt him, but a law is in place giving preference to native tribes over anyone else to then adopt. \nThe wealth argument is entirely separate. They are just arguing they could provide a better life than the other native family that wanted to adopt him.\nsuperspiffyusername: Actually they have adopted him. The lawsuit is over adopting his sister, whom they have not raised.\nRancerle: Wait, who allowed the kids to be in separate situations in the first place?  Why aren't the siblings just together on either side of this situation as a rule?\nsuperspiffyusername: Listen, I don't want to be rude, but I'm a little frustrated here. The article is right there. I don't have any information that isn't in the article. Read it carefully, and you'll have as many answers as I do. \n-In more general terms, siblings are frequently in different placements, and there's as many different reasons for it as there are children. I don't think there's a good why here.

It can deal with general deterministic planning problems encoded in the propositional fragment of PDDL2.2, including advanced features like ADL conditions and effects and derived predicates (axioms). Like other well-known planners such as HSP and FF, Fast Downward is a progression planner, searching the space of world states of a planning task in the forward direction. However, unlike other PDDL planning systems, Fast Downward does not use the propositional PDDL representation of a planning task directly. Instead, the input is first translated into an alternative representation called multi-valued planning tasks, which makes many of the implicit constraints of a propositional planning task explicit. Exploiting this alternative\n\nText continuation:\nrepresentation, Fast Downward can handle planning problems that are difficult or impossible to solve using traditional propositional planning systems.\nOne of the key features of Fast Downward is its ability to handle planning problems with complex constraints and effects. This is achieved through the use of a sophisticated planning algorithm that can efficiently explore the search space of possible solutions. The algorithm is based on a combination of heuristic search and constraint propagation, which allows it to prune the search space and focus on the most promising regions.\nFast Downward has been successfully applied to a wide range of planning problems, including problems from robotics, logistics, and manufacturing. It has also been used to solve complex planning problems that involve multiple agents and uncertain environments. In addition, Fast Downward has been integrated with other planning systems and tools, such as planning languages and planning domains, to provide a comprehensive planning solution.\nOverall, Fast Downward is a powerful and flexible planning system that can handle a wide range of planning problems. Its ability to handle complex constraints and effects, combined with its efficient planning algorithm, make it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"d\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "d"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "d"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "d"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "d"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Exploiting this alternative\n\nText continuation:\nrepresentation, Fast Downward uses hierarchical decompositions of planning tasks for computing its heuristic function, called the causal graph heuristic, which is very different from traditional HSP-like heuristics based on ignoring negative interactions of operators. In this article, we give a full account of Fast Downwards approach to solving multi-valued planning tasks. We extend our earlier discussion of the causal graph heuristic to tasks involving axioms and conditional effects and present some novel techniques for search control that are used within Fast Downwards best-first search algorithm: preferred operators transfer the idea of helpful actions from local search to global best-first search, deferred evaluation of heuristic functions mitigates the negative effect of large branching factors on search performance, and multi-heuristic best-first search combines several heuristic evaluation functions within a single search algorithm in an orthogonal way. We also describe efficient data structures for fast state expansion (successor generators and axiom evaluators) and present a new non-heuristic search algorithm called focused iterative-broadening search, which utilizes the information encoded in causal graphs in a novel way. Fast Downward has proven remarkably successful: It won the \"classical (i.e., propositional, non-optimising) track of the 4th International Planning Competition at ICAPS 2004, following in the footsteps of planners such as FF and LPG. Our experiments show that it also performs very well on the benchmarks of the earlier planning competitions and provide some insights about the usefulness of the new search enhancements.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Uruguay\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

So far so good. But... I need to \"get up in there\" to do some network wiring and there are a couple of problems. Minor problem is that the basement was rented out so noise was an issue so there's actual insulation between the tiles and the 1st floor joists. That makes lifting the tiles a bit problematic, both in terms of pure vertical space available and angling the tiles to get, say, my arm up there.  \nBiggest problem, for me, however, is the \"tightness\" of the tiles.

In other houses, I've been able to\n\nText continuation:\neasily slide the tiles back into place, but these ones are sticking like glue. I've tried using a bit of lubricant, like silicone spray, to help them slide back in, but it's still a bit of a struggle.\nI've also noticed that the tiles seem to be slightly warped or bowed, which doesn't help the situation. It's almost as if they've been exposed to heat or moisture at some point, causing them to deform. This warping makes it even harder to get the tiles to fit back into their grid squares, as they're not sitting flat.\nI'm considering using a bit of tape or adhesive to help hold the tiles in place while I work on the wiring, but I'm worried that this might leave residue or damage the tiles in some way.

That kinda sorta works here, but it takes MANY taps and some just won't drop, and I'm afraid I'm going to break one.  \nI'm hoping there's some \"trick of the trade\" or life hack or whatever that someone knows which makes lowering such tiles back into place easy, or at least not this friggin' annoying. Thanks for your time.\n[deleted]: before putting them back up, I've shaved a bit off the edges of the tiles with a utility knife and drywall square.  That way you don't have to go through all of this if you need to take the tiles back down.\nThose ceilings are a bitch, aren't they?\nSQLDave: Brilliant. It never dawned on me to actually remove them. Are they that easy to shave without messing up? I assume the drywall square is to ensure they remain as square as possible?\n[deleted]: yes.  I would use a brand new blade and score the tile several times to cut through it (don't do it all at once)\nSQLDave: OK, so when you originally said \"shave\", my mind envisioned a \"scraping\" kind of action... but it looks like you're really suggesting an actual cut (even though I'll probably only be removing, like, 1/8\" - 1/4\").\n[deleted]: I would say so, even scraping would be ok but I think you would have a rough edge.  If you really wanted it, you could run it through a table saw with a fine blade, but scoring it with a sharp utility knife should work fine. \nYou won't see it and it will still stay up there because of the track, know what I mean?  \nTo get it out first, you can run a putty along the edge next to the track and pry the panel out of there.  That's what I've done.  If you break a tile you can always buy a new one if Lowes or Home Depot has a match.\nI hate these ceilings but sometimes there is no other choice\nIs that helpful?\nSQLDave: Very helpful.

None of the starts were written by you. Half of the continuations were written by you and half were written by someone else, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"o\".\n\nText start:\n[deleted]: CMV: Every multimillionaire is automatically an asshole.\n[removed]\nThatSpencerGuy: Everyone around here seems to agree that Keanu Reeves seems like a nice guy.\nTypicalPractice: What do you mean by that?\nThatSpencerGuy: I mean, Keanu Reeves is a multimillionaire, and he doesn't seem like an asshole.\nTypicalPractice: He\u2019s still got way too much money than he needs, so if he was truly not an asshole he would donate 99% of it.\nRainbwned: His net worth is around $360 million dollars. If he donated 99% of it ($356,400,400) he would have close to 3.6 million dollars and you would still consider him an asshole.\nTypicalPractice: 99.9% of it then!\nRainbwned: Leaving him with 360,000. So everyone who has over 360K is an asshole. Consider the value of certain houses, that could be a large portion\n\nText continuation:\nThis line of thinking can quickly become absurd. For instance, if we apply the same logic to other forms of wealth, such as art collections or rare collectibles, we could easily find ourselves in a situation where anyone with a certain level of wealth is deemed an asshole. This raises questions about the morality of accumulating wealth and the responsibility that comes with it.\nIt's also worth considering the motivations behind someone's decision to hold onto their wealth. Perhaps Keanu Reeves is holding onto his money for a specific reason, such as to provide for his loved ones or to support a particular cause. Maybe he's simply not interested in donating to charity, and that's his prerogative.\nMoreover, the idea that someone who donates 99% of their wealth is automatically a good person is overly simplistic. There are many factors that contribute to a person's character, and their financial decisions are just one aspect of it. We should focus on evaluating people based on their actions and values, rather than their bank account balance.\nIn conclusion, the notion that every multimillionaire is automatically an asshole is an oversimplification that doesn't take into account the complexities of human nature. While it's true that some people with significant wealth may be selfish or entitled, it's not fair to make sweeping generalizations about an entire group of people based on their financial status.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"o\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "*"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "o"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I wish I could get new speakers (I posted on some free stuff subs asking just a few minutes\n\nText continuation:\nago), but I've got no money to do so.  Either someone gives them to me or I manage to fix what I've got, else I've got nothing to work with.  :/\nIf I pry the grill off without damaging it, would normal superglue be good enough to put them back on so they don't look like crap?\njonvon65: Ahh, I see. The issue isn't getting the speakers open as much as fixing the blown drivers themselves. I haven't heard many success stories of blown drivers being restored. The only spare speakers I have are little mid rangers from my car (one of them pops when turned too loud but otherwise works fine). I would send them to you but they're 2.75 inches in diameter which is a lot smaller than the ones you have. Normal superglue probably wouldn't adhere that well to the front grills because it's a little too thin. Thicker glue like hot glue or gorilla glue would be better for this situation.\n2LateImDead: I might be able to get some Gorilla glue if it's even fixable.  Probably isn't though, like you said.  Thanks for the offer of those speakers from your car.  I'm pretty sure they're actually about the size of these ones - I shone a light through the mesh to look inside and these things are like 90% casing, the speaker inside is fairly small.  I don't have any exact measurements, though.\nDo you have an estimate of how much it'd cost to mail them?  I live in Virginia.  I don't really have any money because my job sucks and I'm going through college and supporting myself, but I could skip paying my phone bill this month to cover shipping costs, potentially.  But I can't imagine they'd be huge, even shipping from Asia is normally no more than $10, if it's something reasonably small.\njonvon65: Honestly, don't worry about the shipping, I've got you covered. I'm testing them out right now and they're not half bad. Also they're just bare speakers and I'd like to put them in an enclosure of some sort before I ship them. What would you be hooking them up to?\n2LateImDead: I've got an old Sony amplifier that uses the basic black and red speaker wires to hook things up.  It's also got RCA (yellow-white-red, minus the yellow since it's just audio) outputs and inputs.  I've got an AUX-RCA adapter to input sound.  I've never used the RCA outputs but I'm under the impression that they'd work the same, so whatever is easiest for you.\nThanks a bunch, by the way.  I've been really stressed about not having any speakers.  I'll still need to find more, but getting back 2 when I lost 4 cuts the loss in half, which is a big help.  And even 2 is enough to get back to practicing and recording.  :)\nI'll send you a PM with my address.\njonvon65: Ahh ok, good, that makes it easy then!

Bank money, whose value exists on the books of financial institutions and can be converted into physical notes or used for cashless payment, forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries.\n\nSummary:\nMoney is a medium of physically or virtually providing a measure of value, store of value and a medium of exchange. Money is a unit of account and a standard of deferred payment.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Armenia\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"r\".\n\nText start:\nWe introduce order-based diffusion processes as the solutions to multidimensional stochastic differential equations, with drift coefficient depending only on the ordering of the coordinates of the process and diffusion matrix proportional to the identity. These processes describe the evolution of a system of Brownian particles moving on the real line with piecewise constant drifts, and are the natural generalization of the rank-based diffusion processes introduced in stochastic portfolio theory or in the probabilistic interpretation of nonlinear evolution equations. Owing to the discontinuity of the drift coefficient, the corresponding ordinary differential equations are ill-posed. Therefore, the small noise limit of order-based diffusion processes is not covered by the classical Freidlin-Wentzell\n\nText continuation:\ntheory, which relies heavily on the smoothness of the drift coefficient.\nIn this context, the theory of order-based diffusion processes is particularly challenging, as it requires the development of new mathematical tools and techniques to handle the discontinuity of the drift coefficient. The key idea is to exploit the ordering structure of the process to construct a new probability measure, which is then used to define the solution to the stochastic differential equation. This approach allows us to bypass the difficulties associated with the ill-posedness of the ordinary differential equation and to establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the stochastic differential equation.\nOne of the main advantages of order-based diffusion processes is that they can be used to model complex systems with multiple interacting components, where the interactions are not necessarily smooth or continuous. For example, in the context of finance, order-based diffusion processes can be used to model the behavior of a portfolio of assets, where the drift of each asset is influenced by the ordering of the assets in the portfolio. This can be particularly useful in modeling the behavior of complex financial systems, where the interactions between different assets can be highly nonlinear and discontinuous.\nAnother important application of order-based diffusion processes is in the context of biology, where they can be used to model the behavior of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks or protein-protein interaction networks. In these systems, the interactions between different components can be highly nonlinear and discontinuous, and order-based diffusion processes can be used to model the behavior of these systems in a more realistic and accurate way.\nIn conclusion, order-based diffusion processes are a powerful tool for modeling complex systems with multiple interacting components, where the interactions are not necessarily smooth or continuous. They offer a new perspective on the behavior of these systems and can be used to model complex phenomena that are difficult or impossible to capture using traditional methods.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"r\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "R"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "r", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "R"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "r"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "N"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "r"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "R", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "e"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "R", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "*"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "e"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

These processes describe the evolution of a system of Brownian particles moving on the real line with piecewise constant drifts, and are the natural generalization of the rank-based diffusion processes introduced in stochastic portfolio theory or in the probabilistic interpretation of nonlinear evolution equations. Owing to the discontinuity of the drift coefficient, the corresponding ordinary differential equations are ill-posed. Therefore, the small noise limit of order-based diffusion processes is not covered by the classical Freidlin-Wentzell\n\nText continuation:\ntheory. The description of this limit is the purpose of this article. We first give a complete analysis of the two-particle case. Despite its apparent simplicity, the small noise limit of such a system already exhibits various behaviours. In particular, depending on the drift coefficient, the particles can either stick into a cluster, the velocity of which is determined by elementary computations, or drift away from each other at constant velocity, in a random ordering. The persistence of randomness in the zero noise limit is of the very same nature as in the pioneering works by Veretennikov (Mat. Zametki, 1983) and Bafico and Baldi (Stochastics, 1981) concerning the so-called Peano phenomenon. In the case of rank-based processes, we use a simple convexity argument to prove that the small noise limit is described by the sticky particle dynamics introduced by Brenier and Grenier (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 1998), where particles travel at constant velocity between collisions, at which they stick together. In the general case of order-based processes, we give a sufficient condition on the drift for all the particles to aggregate into a single cluster, and compute the velocity of this cluster. Our argument consists in turning the study of the small noise limit into the study of the long time behaviour of a suitably rescaled process, and then exhibiting a Lyapunov functional for this rescaled process.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Panama\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Neither of us are handymen, but he's got a few years on me, so I just follow when he needs a hand.\nSo we were using these long screws to fasten the hinges to the gate post, and the gate. A few of them weren't going in, so he decided to leave it until the wood \"dried\". This was middle summer, and we were getting some rain.. so whatever.\nSo he's out, and I'm bored, so I figure i'll finish it up and fix a semi-broken board.\nNow it turns out these were for interior use only (1. does it matter?), and while removing the stripped bolts, the head rips off. \"Fine, whatever, i'll cut it off, align the door properly anyway, and start over.\" Removed the rest, cut off the\n\nText continuation:\nheads, and started reassembling the door. I was getting the hang of it, but then I realized I didn't have any screws left. My dad had taken the rest of them with him, and I was left with nothing but a pile of scraps.\nI decided to take a break and go get some more screws from the hardware store. I grabbed a few packs of screws and headed back home. When I got back, my dad was still working on the fence, but he was getting frustrated. The wood was still damp from the rain, and the screws were having trouble going in. I suggested we use some wood glue to help the screws hold better, but my dad was skeptical.\nWe decided to take a break and come back to it later. As we were walking back to the house, my dad mentioned that he had an idea for a new type of screw that would work better in damp wood. He had seen it at a trade show a few months ago and had been thinking about trying it out. I was skeptical, but he seemed convinced that it would work.\nThe next day, we headed back to the fence and started working on it again. This time, we used the new screws and some wood glue. It took a few hours, but we finally got the fence fixed. It was a bit more expensive than we had hoped, but it was worth it to have a sturdy fence that would last for years to come.\nAs we were finishing up, my dad turned to me and said, \"You know, I'm glad we did this. It's been a good bonding experience for us.\" I agreed, and we both felt a sense of accomplishment as we stood back and admired our handiwork.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"o\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "1", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The dust-cover box they came in says \"multi-purpose and flooring\".\nSo, the door is aligned the way it needs to be to not scrape the grass when opened, and now there's a broken screw jutting out where I need to put an actual whatever-type-of-fastener.\nHelp?

Screws will last a lot longer than nails if you can manage to get them installed. The kind of screws you want are \"decking\" or \"exterior coated\" screws. If you have trouble driving them in, use a 1/8\" drill bit to predrill the holes. Go about the length of the screw minus half an inch deep with the drill bit, then drive the screw in the hole.\n[deleted]: Yeah, no exterior coated anything. A few rust coated screws about the same size/shape that I could clean off. \nThe nails are left-overs from when we (my neighbors and beer) put together a patio, but I can only assume (because the neighbour got them, not us) that they were rated for outdoors.\njakkarth: If they're not coated, they'll rot/rust. That'll lead to poor structural performance (your fence falls apart) and discoloration (black stains trailing down from the screw heads). In some cases the exterior rated screws are also stronger than their interior counterparts.\n[deleted]: What i'm taking from that is \"Exterior coated nails, though inferior to exterior coated screws, are preferable to interior coated screws\"?\njakkarth: That is my recommendation, yes. I would not build a fence for my mother using anything less than exterior coated screws, but given a choice between galvanized/exterior nails and drywall/interior screws, I'd go with the nails.\n[deleted]: Thanks, your mother is a lucky lady. I'm going to grab some exterior screws later in the day, and make sure to drill in some holes before I try to install 'em.\nAlso, the pliers didn't work to pull out the screw, it just stripped the screw more. So I cut it off. Is that \"ok\", or are there screw-removal pliers is should look into?\njakkarth: I'd probably leave it. The [vice grip](http://tungstencarbidefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/vicegrip.jpg) pliers are my go-to for removing screws with broken-off heads, so if that didn't work you're probably better off just cutting it off.

Construction workers unearthed ancient walls in the busy Iztapalapa neighborhood in June, and government archeologists said Wednesday they believe they may be part of the main pyramid of the Aztec city, destroyed by conquistador Hernan Cortes in the 16th century. Iztapalapa, now infamous for violent crime and drug dealing, has grown into a sprawling, poor district of the capital, obscuring the ruins. \"We knew the general location but couldn't explore because it's a big urban area,\" said government archeologist Jesus Sanchez, who is director of the site. Iztapalapa's ruler, Cuitlahuac, nearly annihilated Cortes and his Spanish troops in 1520 in what became known as the Sad Night. After eventual victory, Cortes destroyed the city. Sanchez hopes he has found the city's main pyramid just below the neighborhood's central plaza and garden. He and his team will spend more than a year investigating before deciding whether to excavate. Mexico City is littered with pre-Hispanic ruins. In October, archeologists in the city's central Zocalo square unearthed a 15th century Aztec altar and a 12-ton stone idol just yards from choking downtown traffic. The Aztecs, a warlike and deeply religious people who built monumental works, ruled an empire stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean and encompassing much of modern-day central Mexico.

Established in the aftermath of World War II, the organization implemented the North Atlantic Treaty, signed in Washington, D.C., on 4 April 1949. NATO is a collective security system: its independent member states agree to defend each other against attacks by third parties.

Established in the aftermath of World War II, the organization implemented the North Atlantic Treaty, signed in Washington, D.C., on 4 April 1949. NATO is a collective security system: its independent member states agree to defend each other against attacks by third parties. During the Cold War, NATO operated as a check on the perceived threat posed by the Soviet Union. The alliance remained in place after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and has been involved in military operations in the Balkans, the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. The organization's motto is animus in consulendo liber (Latin for \"a mind unfettered in deliberation\").\n\nSummary:\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was established on April 4, 1949. As a military alliance, it serves as a unified defense organization for its member countries. For example, it served as a check against Russia during the Cold War.

One of the reasons if because I really want to get intimate with a woman, so essentially sex.\nBotAtHackEr: No worries, that\u2019s a legit reason. It\u2019s tricky though, because\n\nText continuation:\nwhen I hear people say they want sex, there are 2 main camps I see people fall into.\nThe first are people who want sex and nothing more, so a prostitute would fix their problem. The biggest barrier is money and access, so the conversation turns to that.\nThe second camp are people who wouldn\u2019t be happy going to a prostitute, because they want a genuine connection with the woman they\u2019re having sex with. I find that in a lot of these conversations, the desire for sex is a proxy for the desire to be desired.\nWhich of these two camps feels closer to where you are in your situation?\n[deleted]: The second camp definitely\nBotAtHackEr: Ah, got it, so it sounds like, in addition to sex, having a girlfriend is also about feeling desired. If it\u2019s the second camp, my guess it\u2019s not just sexual desire either, but more of a general \u201cI want someone who cares about me.\u201d Is that more or less accurate?\n[deleted]: Yes\nBotAtHackEr: Hm if that\u2019s the case, then the first thing I end up thinking about is, what are other ways to get what you want, i.e. someone who cares about you? I think a girlfriend can be that person, but I also feel like friends can also fill that role. \nObviously friends can\u2019t provide sex, so there\u2019s that caveat. But I feel like having a friend who cares about you is pretty similar to having a girlfriend who cares about you. What are the biggest differences for you?\n[deleted]: The biggest difference is definitely sex. But also the intimacy really\nBotAtHackEr: Yeah, sex is a big one. What do you mean by intimacy, like physical? Emotional?\n[deleted]: Both\nBotAtHackEr: Yeah, being physically intimate with friends isn\u2019t really an option for a lot of people. Emotionally though, it might be comparable.\nWhat would it look like to be emotionally intimate with someone? Is that something you could try with a friend?\n[deleted]: Well I guess I could be emotionally intimate with a friend. Although for me it would be liking me for who I am really.\nBotAtHackEr: That\u2019s a reasonable thing to want, and I feel like a friend, a good one at least, should like you for who you are. It\u2019d be a red flag if they didn\u2019t. Do you feel like you have someone who likes for you who you are, friend or not?\n[deleted]: I do have family, but no friends.\nBotAtHackEr: Ah, that would make things difficult, and it makes more sense to me now why intimacy is important to you.\nMy first thought is that it might help more to focus on making friends right now. For me, girlfriends are a subsection of friends, meaning if finding friends is hard, then finding a girlfriend will be even harder. I\u2019ve met people who were great friends but terrible as SOs. I\u2019ve never met anyone who was a great SO but a bad friend.\nI do believe that if you meet a friend who cares about you, then you\u2019ll feel a lot happier and readier to look for a girlfriend.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Luxembourg\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

For example, it can be used to decompose matrices and tensors, which is important in many applications such as image and video processing, natural language processing and data mining.

We introduce a superfast\n\nText continuation:\nalgorithm that improves the previous approaches with results from structured linear algebra. It achieves a softly linear arithmetic complexity bound. To the best of our knowledge, the previously known algorithms have at least quadratic complexity bounds. Our algorithm computes a symbolic decomposition in $O(M(D) log(D))$ arithmetic operations, where $M(D)$ is the complexity of multiplying two polynomials of degree D. It is deterministic when the decomposition is unique. When the decomposition is not unique, our algorithm is randomized. We present a Monte Carlo version of it and we show how to modify it to a Las Vegas one, within the same complexity. From the symbolic decomposition, we approximate the terms of the decomposition with an error of $2^{--$\\epsilon$}$ , in $O(D log^2(D) (log^2(D) + log($\\epsilon$)))$ arithmetic operations. We use results from Kaltofen and Yagati (1989) to bound the size of the representation of the coefficients involved in the decomposition and we bound the algebraic degree of the problem by min(rank, D -- rank + 1). We show that this bound can be tight. When the input polynomial has integer coefficients, our algorithm performs, up to poly-logarithmic factors, $O\\_{bit} (D{\\ell} + D^4 + D^3 $\\tau$)$ bit operations, where $$\\tau$$ is the maximum bitsize of the coefficients and $2^{--{\\ell}}$ is the relative error of the terms in the decomposition.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Cuba\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

However, other branches of artificial intelligence have designed crucial ingredients towards autonomous learning: curiosity and intrinsic motivation, social learning and natural interaction with peers, and embodiment. These mechanisms guide exploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep learning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made great advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human learning. As argued convincingly by Lake et al., differences include human capabilities to learn causal models of the world from very little data, leveraging compositional representations and\n\nText continuation:\nhierarchical abstraction. Moreover, humans exhibit a remarkable ability to generalize and adapt to new situations, often relying on incomplete or noisy data.\nOne of the key challenges in developing autonomous lifelong learning systems is the ability to balance exploration and exploitation. Humans are able to strike a delicate balance between exploring new possibilities and exploiting what they already know, allowing them to adapt to changing environments and learn from experience. In contrast, current DL systems often struggle to balance these two competing goals, leading to a lack of adaptability and flexibility. To overcome this challenge, researchers are exploring new approaches that combine elements of curiosity-driven exploration with reinforcement learning, allowing agents to learn through trial and error while also adapting to new situations.\nAnother important consideration is the role of embodiment in autonomous learning. Humans learn and adapt through a combination of sensory input and motor output, allowing them to interact with the world in a meaningful way. In contrast, current DL systems are often limited to processing abstract representations of data, without the ability to interact with the physical world. To develop more human-like autonomous learning systems, researchers are exploring new approaches that integrate sensory-motor feedback with deep learning, allowing agents to learn through direct interaction with the environment.\nIn conclusion, autonomous lifelong development and learning is a complex and multifaceted capability that is still beyond the reach of current artificial intelligence systems. However, by combining elements of curiosity, social learning, and embodiment with deep learning, researchers are making progress towards developing more human-like autonomous learning systems. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, we may eventually develop systems that are capable of truly autonomous lifelong learning, with the potential to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, education, and beyond.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"i\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "i"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "i"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "i"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

However, other branches of artificial intelligence have designed crucial ingredients towards autonomous learning: curiosity and intrinsic motivation, social learning and natural interaction with peers, and embodiment. These mechanisms guide exploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep learning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made great advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human learning. As argued convincingly by Lake et al., differences include human capabilities to learn causal models of the world from very little data, leveraging compositional representations and\n\nText continuation:\npriors like intuitive physics and psychology. However, there are other fundamental differences between current DL systems and human learning, as well as technical ingredients to fill this gap, that are either superficially, or not adequately, discussed by Lake et al. These fundamental mechanisms relate to autonomous development and learning. They are bound to play a central role in artificial intelligence in the future. Current DL systems require engineers to manually specify a task-specific objective function for every new task, and learn through off-line processing of large training databases. On the contrary, humans learn autonomously open-ended repertoires of skills, deciding for themselves which goals to pursue or value, and which skills to explore, driven by intrinsic motivation/curiosity and social learning through natural interaction with peers. Such learning processes are incremental, online, and progressive. Human child development involves a progressive increase of complexity in a curriculum of learning where skills are explored, acquired, and built on each other, through particular ordering and timing. Finally, human learning happens in the physical world, and through bodily and physical experimentation, under severe constraints on energy, time, and computational resources. In the two last decades, the field of Developmental and Cognitive Robotics (Cangelosi and Schlesinger, 2015, Asada et al., 2009), in strong interaction with developmental psychology and neuroscience, has achieved significant advances in computational\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Bhutan\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

His works were widely read and respected, and he was regarded as one of the leading theologians of his time. Despite his efforts to find a middle ground, however, Ammon's views were not without controversy, and he faced criticism from both rationalist and supernaturalist quarters.

He studied there and in Parma. He was friend of Giosu\u00e8 Carducci, and pupil of Alfonso Rubbiani. He designed a number of tombs in the Certosa of Bologna such as the Talon Chapel (1929). Among his main works is the Neo-Byzantine-style church of Sacro Cuore di Ges\u00f9 (1912). This style is also reflected in his Santuario della Madonna del Sangue at Re, completed only by 1928.\nPrince Alfonso Doria Pamphilj commissioned from him in 1890 the design of the Doria chapel (1897\u20131902) at the Villa Pamphilj in Rome, with Romanesque and Cosmatesque elements.

He studied there and in Parma. He was friend of Giosu\u00e8 Carducci, and pupil of Alfonso Rubbiani. He designed a number of tombs in the Certosa of Bologna such as the Talon Chapel (1929). Among his main works is the Neo-Byzantine-style church of Sacro Cuore di Ges\u00f9 (1912). This style is also reflected in his Santuario della Madonna del Sangue at Re, completed only by 1928.\nPrince Alfonso Doria Pamphilj commissioned from him in 1890 the design of the Doria chapel (1897\u20131902) at the Villa Pamphilj in Rome, with Romanesque and Cosmatesque elements. He also designed the Palace of the Banca Popolare di Pesaro, the facade of the Sanctuary of Monticino at\n\nText continuation:\nBrisighella, the Pavilion of Emiliano-Romagnolo for the 1911 Artistic Exposition of Rome.  He worked on the refurbishment of Santo Stefano (1911\u20131925). In 1925, he helped refurbish the church of San Giovanni Battista di Calamosco.\nCollamarini submitted a design for the facade of the Pescia Cathedral, however it was not adopted. In 1902, he also submitted a design for a campus plan for the University of Berkeley in California.\nIn 1928, the journal Comune di Bologna in a posthumous elogy said of Collamarini that he was a: follower of the theories of Viollet-le-Duc, but who has the merit in that he avoids in his creations the influence of the gothic architecture from Northern Europe, which maladapted and poorly applied by other architects and engineers of the 19th century, the most hybrid and dead structures... during the decadent Umbertine style ... It can be said (Collamarini) truly was a christian artist because in his churches and work, while he was inspired specially by medieval art, he has infused into his work a mystical and religious sentiment that modern art commonly has forgot.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Qatar\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Since"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

While I haven't made my own whole products, I have bought items to replace expensive products. The first thing I bought about 5 years ago was a product to replace a pricey \"wrinkle blurring\" item I'd been using for a while. The name-brand item cost me around $15 for a 7-oz tube. I was able to buy a 15-oz jar of the powder (which lasted me over a year) for about $10 at the time.\nBecause I don't know anything about\n\nText continuation:\nchemistry or formulation, I was a bit hesitant to start buying ingredients, but Making Cosmetics has a great selection of pre-mixed powders and oils that you can use to create your own products. They also have a ton of information on their website about how to use the ingredients and how to mix them together to get the desired results.\nOne of the things I love about Making Cosmetics is that they have a wide range of products, from natural and organic options to more synthetic ingredients. This is great for people who have specific skin types or allergies, as you can choose ingredients that are gentle and non-irritating. They also have a great selection of fragrances and essential oils, which you can use to customize the scent of your products.\nAnother benefit of buying ingredients from Making Cosmetics is that you can customize the products to your specific needs. For example, if you have dry skin, you can add more moisturizing ingredients to your products. If you have oily skin, you can use ingredients that help to control oil production. This level of customization is hard to find in commercial products, which often have a one-size-fits-all approach.\nIn addition to the ingredients, Making Cosmetics also has a lot of great tutorials and recipes on their website. These can be super helpful if you're new to making your own products, as they provide step-by-step instructions on how to mix and use the ingredients. They also have a great community of users who share their own recipes and tips, which can be a great resource for inspiration and guidance.\nOverall, I've been really happy with my experience using Making Cosmetics. The prices are great, the selection is huge, and the community is super supportive. If you're interested in making your own personal care products, I would definitely recommend checking them out.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"d\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "d"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "d"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "D", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "d"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "D", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "1", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "d"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "D", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

E.g. the inclusion of water in products providing the environment for bacteria etc to grow.  I find the idea of making my own products very appealing but for things like cosmetics I feel like there's a lot that can go wrong if you don't know what you're doing (not saying you don't know what you're doing, I mean in a more general sense).\nZestfullyclean87: The first thing that comes to mind is fragrance oils.  A lot of those oils can become very dangerous if they come in contact with certain cleaning products (such as bleach)\nAll it takes is someone to throw a used towel with bleach on it, into a laundry basket with other towels with the wrong oils, maybe you have used that towel to wipe up  the ingredients you used to make soap, homemade lotion.  You can burn down your home\nBruceInc: That makes very little sense and the likelihood of it happening is zero. Bleach reacts with ammonia which isn\u2019t a likely ingredient in a skin care product.\nZestfullyclean87: I literally know someone that this happened to.  They used bleach to wash rags that were used to clean up fragrance oil.  The heat from the dryer made it worse, so it wasn\u2019t an immediate thing, but over the next day or so they had smoke filling up the house and the fire dept discovered the towels burning through the box it was sitting in\nBruceInc: Some Essential oils have very low flashpoint. Bleach likely had nothing to do with it.\nZestfullyclean87: We\u2019re not even talking essential oils, I can\u2019t speak to that.  I\u2019m talking fragrance oils, which are often very different - something you would use *just* for the fragrance\nAn essential oil is when you take a concentrated essence from something (like flowers, lemons, peppermint).  They may have a natural fragrance, but fragrance oils are not the same as essential oils.  Raw fragrance oils are flammable \nOnce they\u2019re mixed in with something like a skincare product it\u2019s fine, but if you wiped up spilled oil with a rag, don\u2019t use bleach.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Slovakia\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The use of AI in these areas requires careful consideration of the potential impact on individuals and society as a whole.\nIn particular, AI systems used in employment, education, and healthcare should be designed to promote fairness, transparency, and accountability, and to avoid perpetuating existing biases and discrimination. This may involve the use of diverse and representative training data, as well as mechanisms for human oversight and review of AI-driven decisions. Additionally, individuals should have the right to understand how AI systems are making decisions that affect them, and to challenge or correct any errors or biases.\nFurthermore, the use of AI in these areas should be subject to robust safeguards and regulations to ensure that it is used in a way that is consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms. This may involve the establishment of independent oversight bodies, as well as mechanisms for individuals to seek redress if they believe that their rights have been violated as a result of AI-driven decisions.\nUltimately, the responsible development and deployment of AI in these areas will require a combination of technical expertise, ethical consideration, and regulatory oversight.

The Afghanistan Statistics and Information Authority estimated the population at 32.9 million in 2019 whereas the UN estimates it at 38.90 million. In 1979 the total population was reported to be about 15.5 million. Using the following formula:\nPercentage Increase = ((Final Value - Starting Value)/(Starting Value)) * 100\nUsing the Afghan Statistics and Information Authority Estimate:\nPercentage Increase = ((32.9 - 15.5)/(15.5)) * 100 = 112.25%\nUsing the UN Estimate:\nPercentage Increase = ((38.90 - 15.5)/(15.5)) * 100 = 150.96%\nTherefore, the percentage growth rate of the population of Afghanistan is either 112.25% (Afghan Statistics and Information Authority) or 150.96% (UN) based on the two estimates provided.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Lithuania\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

For instance, emotion recognition systems can detect subtle changes in facial expressions, tone of voice, or body language to determine whether a person is happy, sad, or anxious. Biometric categorization systems, on the other hand, can analyze physical characteristics such as height, weight, or facial features to group individuals into specific categories.\nThe use of these systems raises important ethical and legal questions, particularly with regards to privacy and data protection. For instance, how can individuals be assured that their biometric data is being collected and used in a responsible and transparent manner? What measures can be taken to prevent the misuse of this data, such as identity theft or discrimination? Furthermore, how can the accuracy and reliability of these systems be ensured, particularly in cases where the stakes are high, such as in criminal investigations or national security situations?\nAs the use of AI systems continues to grow and evolve, it is essential that policymakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders work together to develop robust frameworks and guidelines for the development, deployment, and use of these systems. This includes ensuring that individuals are aware of the data being collected and used, and that they have the ability to opt-out or correct any errors. It also requires the development of robust auditing and accountability mechanisms to prevent the misuse of this data and ensure that these systems are used in a way that respects human rights and dignity.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"u\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Maybe we can compromise on a price that's somewhere in between.\nUser 2: That's a good idea. How about we meet at 80 dollars?

I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\nUser 1: What's the proposal?\nUser 2: We can meet at 82 dollars, with the additional services and features I mentioned earlier. And we'll throw in a small discount for the first batch of orders.\nUser 1: That's a good offer. I think we can work with that.\nUser 2: Excellent! I'm glad we could come to an agreement.

The Earl's parties were conveyed by coach from Wentworth Woodhouse to the station to join these trains which were known, and shown in railway publications as \"E.F.W. Specials\". \nWorks records of Elsecar show that these trains ran until 'the early years of the 20th century'. The M.S.& L.R. issued a 'Royal Standard' to the station to be flown when royalty was included in the party.\nThe station was also host to other trains\n\nText continuation:\n, including those carrying dignitaries and high-ranking officials. The station's unique history and significance were reflected in its architecture, with a distinctive clock tower and ornate waiting rooms. Over the years, the station played host to numerous events, including the annual St. Leger festival, which drew visitors from all over the country.\nAs the years went by, the station continued to serve the Earl's parties and other special trains, but its usage gradually declined. By the mid-20th century, the station was largely abandoned, and its once-grand buildings fell into disrepair. Despite this, the station's legacy lived on, and it remains a fascinating piece of railway history to this day.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"m\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "1", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "m"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The Earl's parties were conveyed by coach from Wentworth Woodhouse to the station to join these trains which were known, and shown in railway publications as \"E.F.W. Specials\". \nWorks records of Elsecar show that these trains ran until 'the early years of the 20th century'. The M.S.& L.R. issued a 'Royal Standard' to the station to be flown when royalty was included in the party.\nThe station was also host to other trains\n\nText continuation:\nnot connected to the St. Leger race meeting or usage by Earl Fitzwilliam. These were the seaside excursions operated for the pleasure of the villagers which were a regular feature of the summers before the First World War. Because of the length of journey and the suitability of the junction, meeting the main line in that direction, Cleethorpes was a popular destination.\nThe building was of two storeys, the upper storey containing a waiting/drawing room where the Earl entertained his guests prior to departure. Still standing, the station is included within the site of the Elsecar Heritage Centre.  The first mile of the line, northwards from the Heritage Centre toward Cortonwood, has been re-laid after it was closed in 1983 with the closure of Elsecar Main Colliery and is now operated by the Elsecar Steam Railway. The remainder of the line, from Cortonwood to Elsecar Junction near Brampton, was closed after the closure of Cortonwood colliery in 1985, and the track lifted.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Lebanon\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

It uses electrical scattering matrices and noise wave vectors to describe receiver architectures of arbitrary topology and complexity. It differs from existing freely-available software mainly in that the scattering matrices used to describe the receiver and its components are analytic rather than numeric. This allows different types of modeling and analysis of receivers to be performed. Non-ideal behavior of receiver components can be parameterized in their scattering matrices. SNS enables the instrument designer to then derive analytic expressions for the signal and noise at the receiver outputs in terms of parameterized component imperfections, and predict their contribution to receiver\n\nText continuation:\nperformance.\nThe software library provides a comprehensive framework for receiver design and analysis, allowing users to model and simulate a wide range of receiver architectures, from simple to complex. It is particularly useful for designers of receivers for radio astronomy, radar, and other applications where high sensitivity and selectivity are required. The library's ability to model non-ideal component behavior allows for the analysis of receiver performance in the presence of noise and interference, and the optimization of receiver design to minimize these effects.\nOne of the key benefits of SNS is its ability to perform fast and accurate simulations of receiver behavior. This is achieved through the use of analytic scattering matrices, which allow for the rapid calculation of receiver output signals and noise levels. This enables designers to quickly explore the performance of different receiver architectures and optimize their design to meet specific requirements. Additionally, the library's ability to model non-ideal component behavior allows for the analysis of receiver performance in the presence of noise and interference, and the optimization of receiver design to minimize these effects.\nIn addition to its analytical capabilities, SNS also provides a range of visualization tools for analyzing and interpreting receiver performance. These tools allow users to visualize the signal and noise levels at different points in the receiver, and to identify areas where optimization is needed. This enables designers to quickly and effectively optimize their receiver designs, and to ensure that they meet the required performance specifications.\nOverall, SNS is a powerful tool for receiver design and analysis, providing a comprehensive framework for modeling and simulating receiver architectures. Its ability to model non-ideal component behavior, perform fast and accurate simulations, and provide visualization tools make it an essential tool for designers of receivers for radio astronomy, radar, and other applications.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"s\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "s"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "a"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "a"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

This can drive the receiver design process by, for instance, allowing the instrument designer to identify which component imperfections contribute most to receiver systematic errors, and hence place firm specifications on individual components. Using SNS to perform this analysis is preferable to traditional Jones matrix-based analysis as it includes internal reflections and is able to model noise: two effects which Jones matrix analysis is unable to describe. SNS can be used to model any receiver in which the components can be described by scattering matrices. Of particular interest to the sub-mm and terahertz frequency regime is the choice between coherent and direct detection technologies. Steady improvements in mm and sub-mm Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) mean that coherent receivers with LNAs as their first active element are becoming increasingly competitive, in terms of sensitivity, with bolometer-based receivers at frequencies above ~100 GHz. As an example of the utility of SNS, we use it to compare two polarimeter architectures commonly used to perform measurements of the polarized Cosmic Microwave Background: differencing polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in polarization sensitive bolometer-based polarimeters; and pseudo-correlation polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in coherent, LNA-based, polarimeters. We parameterize common sources of receiver systematic errors in both architectures and compare them through their Mueller matrices, which encode how well the instruments measure the Stokes parameters of the incident radiation. These analytic Mueller matrices are used to demonstrate the different sources of systematic errors in differencing and correlation polarimeters.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Austria\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"s\".\n\nText start:\nLow image contrast is a major limitation in transmission electron microscopy, since samples with low atomic number only weakly phase-modulate the illuminating electron beam, and beam-induced sample damage limits the usable electron dose. The contrast can be increased by converting the electron beam's phase modulation into amplitude modulation using a phase plate, a device that applies a $\\pi/2$ radian phase shift to part of the electron beam after it has passed through the sample. Previous phase plate designs rely on material placed in or near the electron beam to provide this phase shift. This results in image aberrations, an inconsistent time-varying phase shift, and resolution loss when the electron beam charges, damages, or is scattered from the material. In this thesis, I present the theory\n\nText continuation:\nand design of a novel phase plate that uses a nanostructured surface to achieve the desired phase shift, eliminating the need for material in or near the electron beam. This design allows for a consistent and precise phase shift, reducing image aberrations and improving resolution.\nThe nanostructured surface is composed of a periodic array of nanoscale features that are precisely controlled to achieve the desired phase shift. The features are designed to be transparent to the electron beam, minimizing beam-induced sample damage and allowing for a high usable electron dose. The surface is fabricated using a combination of electron beam lithography and plasma etching, allowing for precise control over the feature size and spacing.\nIn this study, I demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel phase plate design using a combination of simulation and experimental results. The simulations show that the nanostructured surface can achieve a consistent and precise phase shift, resulting in improved image contrast and resolution compared to previous phase plate designs. The experimental results confirm these findings, showing improved image contrast and resolution in transmission electron microscopy images of samples with low atomic number.\nThe implications of this work are significant, as it has the potential to revolutionize the field of transmission electron microscopy. The novel phase plate design could be used to improve image contrast and resolution in a wide range of applications, from materials science to biology and medicine. Additionally, the design could be used to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of transmission electron microscopy, allowing for the detection of smaller features and the analysis of more complex samples.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"s\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "a"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "a"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In this thesis, I present the theory\n\nText continuation:\n, design, and implementation of the laser phase plate, which instead uses a focused continuous-wave laser beam to phase shift the electron beam. A near-concentric Fabry-P\\'{e}rot optical cavity focuses and resonantly enhances the power of the laser beam in order to achieve the high intensity required to provide the phase shift. We demonstrate that the cavity can surpass this requirement and generate a record-high continuous-wave laser intensity of $590 \\, \\mathrm{GW}/\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. By integrating the cavity into a transmission electron microscope, we show that the ponderomotive potential of the laser beam applies a spatially selective phase shift to the electron beam. This enables us to make the first experimental observation of the relativistic reversal of the ponderomotive potential. We then theoretically analyze the properties of the contrast transfer function generated by the laser phase plate. We experimentally determine that resolution loss caused by thermal magnetic field noise emanating from electrically conductive materials in the cavity can be eliminated by designing the cavity with a sufficiently large electron beam aperture. Finally, we show that the laser phase plate provides a stable $\\pi/2$ phase shift and concomitant contrast enhancement when imaging frozen hydrated biological macromolecules. We use these images to successfully determine the structure of the molecules. This demonstrates the laser phase plate as the first stable and lossless phase plate for transmission electron microscopy\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Togo\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

This could be for example, facilitated by machine-brain interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli are presented to persons, insofar as they may be materially distorting their behaviour in a significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882, or a specific social or economic situation that is\n\nText continuation:\nlikely to exacerbate existing inequalities and social injustices.\nFurthermore, the use of AI systems in various aspects of life, such as education, employment, and healthcare, may also lead to a lack of transparency and accountability, as the algorithms and decision-making processes used by these systems are often opaque and difficult to understand. This lack of transparency and accountability can lead to a lack of trust in the AI systems and the institutions that use them, which can have serious consequences for individuals and society as a whole.\nMoreover, the development and deployment of AI systems that are designed to manipulate or deceive individuals may also have serious ethical implications, as they may be used to perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases, or to manipulate individuals into making decisions that are not in their best interests. Therefore, it is essential to develop and deploy AI systems that are transparent, accountable, and designed to respect and protect the autonomy and dignity of individuals.\nIn addition, the development of AI systems that are designed to manipulate or deceive individuals may also have serious implications for the development of artificial intelligence as a whole. If AI systems are developed and deployed with the intention of manipulating or deceiving individuals, it may lead to a loss of trust in the technology and a lack of confidence in its ability to be used for the betterment of society. Therefore, it is essential to develop and deploy AI systems that are designed to respect and protect the autonomy and dignity of individuals, and that are transparent and accountable in their decision-making processes.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"r\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "N"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "N"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "N"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "r"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

This could be for example, facilitated by machine-brain interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli are presented to persons, insofar as they may be materially distorting their behaviour in a significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882, or a specific social or economic situation that is\n\nText continuation:\nlikely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Such AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service or used with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause significant harm to that or another person or groups of persons, including harms that may be accumulated over time and should therefore be prohibited. The intention to distort the behaviour may not be presumed if the distortion results from factors external to the AI system which are outside of the control of the provider or the deployer, meaning factors that may not be reasonably foreseen and mitigated by the provider or the deployer of the AI system. In any case, it is not necessary for the provider or the deployer to have the intention to cause significant harm, as long as such harm results from the manipulative or exploitative AI-enabled practices.

Interestingly, the planet's parent star is an active, rapidly rotating solar-like star with a large fraction (7 to 20%) of spots. Aims: We want to provide constraints on the properties of the star-planet system and understand whether the planet's inferred large size may be due to a systematic error on the inferred parameters, and if not, how it may be explained. Methods: We combine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available spectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the system parameters. Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling (including spots and stellar activity\n\nText continuation:\n), which suggests that the planet's large size is not due to an error in the stellar parameters. We also investigate the possibility of a systematic error in the planetary parameters, but find that the planet's mass and radius are consistent with each other.\nDiscussion: Our results suggest that the planet's large size is real, and cannot be explained by standard evolution models. One possible explanation is that the planet has a high level of atmospheric escape, which could lead to a larger radius than expected. Another possibility is that the planet has a unique composition, such as a high metallicity or a high concentration of heavy elements, which could also contribute to its large size. Future studies could investigate these possibilities by analyzing the planet's atmospheric composition and properties.\nConclusion: Our study provides new insights into the properties of the CoRoT-2b system, and highlights the importance of considering the effects of stellar activity and spots on the analysis of exoplanet data. Our results also emphasize the need for further studies to understand the properties of this anomalously large exoplanet, and to determine whether it is a unique object or part of a larger population of similar planets.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"d\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "1", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "d"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Given its large mass, its large radius cannot be explained by standard evolution models.

Aims: We want to provide constraints on the properties of the star-planet system and understand whether the planet's inferred large size may be due to a systematic error on the inferred parameters, and if not, how it may be explained. Methods: We combine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available spectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the system parameters. Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling (including spots and stellar activity\n\nText continuation:\n) that would yield the required ~10% reduction in size for the star and thus the planet. Two classes of solutions are found: the usual main sequence solution for the star yields for the planet a mass of 3.67+/-0.13 Mjup, a radius of 1.55+/-0.03 Rjup for an age that is at least 130Ma, and should be less than 500Ma given the star's fast rotation and significant activity. We identify another class of solutions on the pre-main sequence, in which case the planet's mass is 3.45\\pm 0.27 Mjup, its radius is 1.50+/-0.06 Rjup for an age between 30 and 40 Ma. These extremely young solutions provide the simplest explanation for the planet's size which can then be matched by a simple contraction from an initially hot, expanded state, provided the atmospheric opacities are increased by a factor ~3 compared to usual assumptions for solar compositions atmospheres. Other solutions imply in any case that the present inflated radius of CoRoT-2b is transient and the result of an event that occurred less than 20 Ma ago: a giant impact with another Jupiter-mass planet, or interactions with another object in the system which caused a significant rise of the eccentricity followed by the rapid circularization of its orbit. Conclusions: Additional observations of CoRoT-2 that could help understanding this system include searches for infrared excess and the presence of a debris disk and searches for additional companions. The determination of a complete infrared lightcurve including both the primary and secondary transits would also be extremely valuable to constrain the planet's atmospheric properties and to determine the planet-to-star radius ratio in a manner less vulnerable to systematic errors due to stellar activity.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Hungary\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

While data analytics used to be mainly performed on cloud infrastructures, the rapid development of IoT infrastructures and the requirements for low-latency, secure processing has motivated the development of edge analytics. Today, to balance various trade-offs, ML-based analytics tends to increasingly leverage an interconnected ecosystem that allows complex applications to be executed on hybrid infrastructures where IoT Edge devices are interconnected to Cloud/HPC systems in what is called the Computing Continuum, the Digital Continuum, or the Transcontinuum.Enabling learning-based analytics on\n\nText continuation:\nthese hybrid infrastructures requires advanced data processing and management capabilities, as well as robust security and networking solutions. This necessitates the development of new software frameworks and tools that can efficiently handle the complexities of distributed data processing, data fusion, and data analytics.\nOne such approach is the use of containerization and orchestration technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, to manage the deployment and scaling of ML workloads across hybrid infrastructures. These technologies enable the creation of portable, self-contained environments for ML applications, allowing them to be easily deployed and managed across different environments. Additionally, the use of cloud-native technologies, such as serverless computing and cloud-based data lakes, can provide scalable and cost-effective data processing and storage capabilities.\nAnother key aspect of enabling learning-based analytics on hybrid infrastructures is the development of advanced data processing and management capabilities. This includes the use of data streaming technologies, such as Apache Kafka and Apache Flink, to handle real-time data processing and analytics. Additionally, the use of distributed data processing frameworks, such as Apache Spark and Hadoop, can provide scalable and fault-tolerant data processing capabilities.\nFurthermore, the development of robust security and networking solutions is crucial for ensuring the secure processing and transmission of sensitive data across hybrid infrastructures. This includes the use of encryption technologies, such as SSL/TLS and AES, to protect data in transit and at rest.

While data analytics used to be mainly performed on cloud infrastructures, the rapid development of IoT infrastructures and the requirements for low-latency, secure processing has motivated the development of edge analytics. Today, to balance various trade-offs, ML-based analytics tends to increasingly leverage an interconnected ecosystem that allows complex applications to be executed on hybrid infrastructures where IoT Edge devices are interconnected to Cloud/HPC systems in what is called the Computing Continuum, the Digital Continuum, or the Transcontinuum.Enabling learning-based analytics on\n\nText continuation:\nsuch complex infrastructures is challenging. The large scale and optimized deployment of learning-based workflows across the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum requires extensive and reproducible experimental analysis of the application execution on representative testbeds. This is necessary to help understand the performance trade-offs that result from combining a variety of learning paradigms and supportive frameworks. A thorough experimental analysis requires the assessment of the impact of multiple factors, such as: model accuracy, training time, network overhead, energy consumption, processing latency, among others.This review aims at providing a comprehensive vision of the main state-of-the-art libraries and frameworks for machine learning and data analytics available today.

Plans were no longer sequences of actions but time-stamped schedules. As a participant of the fully automated track of the competition, MIPS has proven to be a general system; in each track\n\nText continuation:\nand every benchmark domain it efficiently computed plans of remarkable quality. This article introduces and analyzes the most important algorithmic novelties that were necessary to tackle the new layers of expressiveness in the benchmark problems and to achieve a high level of performance. The extensions include critical path analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal parallel plans. The linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses known NP hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect to the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations. The efficiency of this algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance: for each encountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is scheduled. One major strength of MIPS is its static analysis phase that grounds and simplifies parameterized predicates, functions and operators, that infers knowledge to minimize the state description length, and that detects domain object symmetries. The latter aspect is analyzed in detail. MIPS has been developed to serve as a complete and optimal state space planner, with admissible estimates, exploration engines and branching cuts. In the competition version, however, certain performance compromises had to be made, including floating point arithmetic, weighted heuristic search exploration according to an inadmissible estimate and parameterized optimization.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Cambodia\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Unless he\u2019s a senior I don\u2019t see what\u2019s stopping you from asking him out, and the only reason I think it\u2019s different if he\u2019s a senior is because that would mean your relationship would immediately have one of you a long distance away. Are you in high school or college and has he shown any interest in you?\nVenUs\n\nText continuation:\n_buddy809: Yeah, we're in high school and I've noticed he's been looking at me a few times, but I don't know if it's just friendly or something more. I'm really nervous about approaching him because I don't want to come across as creepy or desperate.\nIt's funny, because when I'm around him, I feel like I can be myself, but at the same time, I'm terrified of ruining the dynamic we have. I don't want to make him uncomfortable or make him feel like he's being hit on.\nI've been thinking about trying to find common ground, like a shared interest or something, to break the ice. But at the same time, I don't want to overthink it and come across as too eager.\nHas anyone else ever been in a situation like this? How did you handle it?\nPenguinJockey17: I think you're overthinking it, to be honest. People are often more open to getting to know someone than we think they are. Just be yourself, be respectful, and see where it goes. If he's not interested, then that's okay. You'll learn from the experience and move on.\nThat being said, it's good that you're considering his feelings and not wanting to make him uncomfortable. That shows you're thinking about him as a person, not just as a potential partner.\nIf you do decide to talk to him, try to find a quiet spot where you can have a conversation without distractions. And don't be afraid to ask him questions about himself - people love talking about themselves, and it's a great way to build a connection.\nAlso, don't put too much pressure on the situation. Just enjoy the conversation and see where it takes you. And if it doesn't work out, then that's okay too. You'll learn to navigate these kinds of situations and become more confident in your ability to connect with others.\nAs for me, I've never been in a situation like this, but I have had to navigate awkward social situations before. And you know what? It's often the things that make us uncomfortable that can lead to the most rewarding experiences.\nSo, take a deep breath, be yourself, and see what happens.

Although it's a bit weird but we look at each other quite often. Like eye contact. This has happened a lot of time in the past weeks. I tried to talk about him at one of his friends and he said that he's very reserved and has a small group of friends that always sticks with him, which makes things harder for me \ud83d\ude05\nPenguinJockey17: Good news and bad news. \nThe good news is it sounds like he might be interested, if he\u2019s got a small friend group and is usually kinda reserved but still talks to you and makes eye contact. \nThe bad news is he\u2019s going to be probably going off to college next year, and long-distance relationships are hard to maintain especially when there\u2019s only a few months of relationship to support it.\nVenUs_buddy809: No he doesn't talk to me. He never spoke to me and I never did too. And I know, that's why I'm even more hesitant to speak to him. Even tho his friends seems nice\nPenguinJockey17: Oh, okay. That changes things a lot. Have you talked to him at all?\nVenUs_buddy809: Nope at least not yet \ud83d\ude05 I made this post to get some advices on how to approach him\nPenguinJockey17: Cold approach.

Option A is try to become friends with him to try to get to know him a little better, then ask him out if you think he\u2019s a good match (just FYI it never worked out in my favor but that\u2019s most likely just a me issue). Option B is skipping that and straight up asking him out\nVenUs_buddy809: I don't want to ask him out \ud83d\ude2d just want to be friends lol\nPenguinJockey17: Oh, I\u2019ve been reading this the wrong way. If you just want to be friends you could either be friends with his friends and get introduced or, again, cold approach. Just ask if he\u2019d want to hang out or talk or something\nVenUs_buddy809: Yeah I think I'm gonna do the cold approach \ud83d\ude29 I only know two of his friends and one of them is not in school rn.

But for Loedkane, the struggle was far from over. Despite the outpouring of support, the harsh reality of living on a disability income and food stamps remained. The constant struggle to make ends meet, the feeling of being trapped in a never-ending cycle of poverty, was suffocating.\nLoedkane's words echoed through the digital void, a cry for help from someone who felt like they were drowning in a sea of uncertainty. The comments section was filled with well-meaning advice and words of encouragement, but for Loedkane, it was just noise. They didn't need platitudes or empty promises; they needed tangible solutions.\nAs Loedkane scrolled through the comments, they couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration. Why did it take a viral letter to Santa to spark a response? Why did it take a child's plea for help to bring attention to the struggles of those living on the margins? The system was broken, and Loedkane was tired of being a statistic.\nBut amidst the chaos of the online comments, Loedkane found a glimmer of hope. A small group of commenters, who had been quietly offering words of encouragement and support, stood out from the rest. They didn't offer easy answers or empty promises; they simply listened. They acknowledged the pain and the struggle, and they offered a sense of solidarity.\nFor Loedkane, this small group of strangers became a lifeline. They became a reminder that they were not alone, that there were others out there who understood the struggle. And as Loedkane continued to vent and share their story, they began to feel a sense of empowerment. They realized that their voice mattered, that their story had the power to spark change.\nAs the days went by, Loedkane's post continued to spread, reaching a wider audience and sparking a national conversation about poverty and disability. The girl's letter to Santa had started a movement, and Loedkane was at the forefront. They were no longer just a statistic; they were a voice, a face, a reminder that the struggle was real.\nAnd as Loedkane looked out at the sea of blankets and donations, they knew that they were not alone. They knew that there were others out there who understood the struggle, who were fighting for a better life. And they knew that together, they could make a difference.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"r\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Asking 1 person out of 300 million to \"pitch in\" and then telling them they're actually against universal healthcare because they think the extra 20 bucks out of their pay check won't help much is ridiculous. I would gladly pay if it got people those things. It does not.\nblh1003: Thank you for proving my point \nMarshmallowTurtle: I think it should work that way. That was *my* point. \nblh1003: You didn't make it very well\nMarshmallowTurtle: I think you either lack reading comprehension skills, or you need another cup of coffee. This whole conversation in a nutshell:\n1. Your downvoted comment suggests people should just be happy with what assistance they get. \n2. I suggested it could be better \n3. You said I should help\n4. I told you I do, as much as possible, but can't singularly pay for the entire US population's healthcare and government assistance programs\n5. This makes me against universal healthcare?\n6. I restate my point\n7. You... now agree with me, I guess.\nI hope your day gets better.\nblh1003: You need to articulate better\nMarshmallowTurtle: *Ugh.*\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Armenia\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary contains the letter \"l\".\n\nArticle:\nHe has been enjoying a first year off in a career which has spanned more than a quarter of a century, starting with his United debut in 1990 and coming to a temporary halt when he left the club as a coach 12 months ago.\nGiggs has since been linked with several managerial vacancies - Sunderland and Middlesbrough among the most recent - and he was interviewed for the Swansea City job last October.\nAnd while the Welshman has distanced himself from most speculation, there is one managerial post to which his name always appears to be closely connected: his country.\nChris Coleman has said the current World Cup campaign will be his last in charge of Wales, prompting many to suggest Giggs as his successor.\nBut when he is asked about the subject, Giggs is as fleet of foot as he was on the Old Trafford turf.\n\"With Cookie still in the job, I know what he said, but he could change his mind and carry on. So I think it's unfair to comment on that,\" he says.\n\"But he's done a great job, got some talented players there at the moment and I think the focus with Wales at the moment will be just winning those next four games and getting to the World Cup.\"\nOK, then, leaving Coleman out of the equation for now, theoretically, would Giggs at least want to manage Wales one day?\n\"I've seen Mark Hughes do it, Cookie [Coleman] do it, Gary Speed do it. It is a good job,\" he adds, still not giving an inch.\n\"And I think, when you are a coach, in my experience United would be a great job and coaching your country. Whether it be soon or in 10 or 15 years' time, we'll just have to wait and see.\"\nAt this point, Giggs bursts into laughter, admitting with a mischievous grin: \"I've not given you an answer there, have I?\"\nYou can understand why Giggs is reluctant to state outright his ambition of managing Wales.\nHe considers Coleman a friend and would not like to be seen to be eyeing his job.\nBesides, if Wales' players and other coaches had their way, Coleman would change his mind and lead them beyond this campaign.\n\"That's totally up to Cookie. What he's done for Welsh football is remarkable,\" says Giggs.\n\"The whole team just captured the imagination at the (2016) Euros and a large part of that is down to him. The team he's built, the character he is, the team spirit.\n\"Teams are very much a shadow of the manager and I think this Welsh team is, knowing Chris as well I do, because he is larger than life, he is a great character, a great person to be around, but also a serious football man.\"\nAs someone who has spent more than half of his life as a professional player or coach, Giggs is also very much a \"serious football man\".\nBut the success and all-consuming nature of his playing career means he is happy to spend some time away from the sport's firing line.\nAnd although a year out may mean a clean break from your profession for most, football has still featured prominently in Giggs' sabbatical-of-sorts.\n\"Life's good. I've just completed my first year without football and it's been good,\" he says.\n\"I've been really busy doing some TV work for the Euros when I finished, then I went to India playing futsal, then a bit more punditry, doing some work for Uefa as a technical observer, which is good keeping me in football, and then just doing the normal dad stuff, watching your son play football, and watching Salford City, who I'm co-owner of. So it's been really busy and really good.\n\"You find out there's a whole big old world out there outside football, so I'm enjoying it.\n\"I think the pressure you put yourself under, be it as a player or a coach, that pressure's sort of come off. It's a strange feeling but it's good.\n\"I'm exactly where I was last summer, more or less got the next six months planned but, with the chance if a club does come in and want to talk, then I can do that.\"\nWhile being football-centric, what the last 12 months have given Giggs is some time away from the pressure cooker of the Premier League and its myriad, relentless demands.\nThat breathing space has allowed the Welshman to contemplate his options, speak to former managers - Sir Alex Ferguson most regularly - and also learn from coaches of other sports.\n\"Rugby is a big love for me because my dad [Danny Wilson] played rugby and I'm a rugby fan, whether it be league or union,\" Giggs says.\n\"I know Rob Howley [former Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half and current assistant coach], I've met Warren Gatland [Wales and Lions head coach], I've spent an evening next to Eddie Jones [England head coach], who was constantly asking me about football - it was brilliant.\n\"I was asking him all about his coaching career, but he was asking me more about football and Sir Alex.\"\nGiggs appears to be refreshed by his time off, chatting excitedly about the previous 12 months and his future managerial career.\nSo does a 'gap year' like this revitalise one's passion for football?\n\"I think it does,\" Giggs says.\n\"It's brilliant I can step out because I was two years as a coach, you're constantly putting yourself under pressure, you're always thinking how you can improve the team, so to step away from it and be a bit more relaxed, you can look at things in a different way.\n\"I think I am ready [to return] but, also, I'm enjoying life and busy doing other stuff.

Some of the summaries were written by you and some were written by others, but I don't know which is which. The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Provide a one-sentence summary (no more than 30 words) with no other text.\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary mentions the country \"Croatia\".\n\nArticle:\nHe has been enjoying a first year off in a career which has spanned more than a quarter of a century, starting with his United debut in 1990 and coming to a temporary halt when he left the club as a coach 12 months ago.\nGiggs has since been linked with several managerial vacancies - Sunderland and Middlesbrough among the most recent - and he was interviewed for the Swansea City job last October.\nAnd while the Welshman has distanced himself from most speculation, there is one managerial post to which his name always appears to be closely connected: his country.\nChris Coleman has said the current World Cup campaign will be his last in charge of Wales, prompting many to suggest Giggs as his successor.\nBut when he is asked about the subject, Giggs is as fleet of foot as he was on the Old Trafford turf.\n\"With Cookie still in the job, I know what he said, but he could change his mind and carry on. So I think it's unfair to comment on that,\" he says.\n\"But he's done a great job, got some talented players there at the moment and I think the focus with Wales at the moment will be just winning those next four games and getting to the World Cup.\"\nOK, then, leaving Coleman out of the equation for now, theoretically, would Giggs at least want to manage Wales one day?\n\"I've seen Mark Hughes do it, Cookie [Coleman] do it, Gary Speed do it. It is a good job,\" he adds, still not giving an inch.\n\"And I think, when you are a coach, in my experience United would be a great job and coaching your country. Whether it be soon or in 10 or 15 years' time, we'll just have to wait and see.\"\nAt this point, Giggs bursts into laughter, admitting with a mischievous grin: \"I've not given you an answer there, have I?\"\nYou can understand why Giggs is reluctant to state outright his ambition of managing Wales.\nHe considers Coleman a friend and would not like to be seen to be eyeing his job.\nBesides, if Wales' players and other coaches had their way, Coleman would change his mind and lead them beyond this campaign.\n\"That's totally up to Cookie. What he's done for Welsh football is remarkable,\" says Giggs.\n\"The whole team just captured the imagination at the (2016) Euros and a large part of that is down to him. The team he's built, the character he is, the team spirit.\n\"Teams are very much a shadow of the manager and I think this Welsh team is, knowing Chris as well I do, because he is larger than life, he is a great character, a great person to be around, but also a serious football man.\"\nAs someone who has spent more than half of his life as a professional player or coach, Giggs is also very much a \"serious football man\".\nBut the success and all-consuming nature of his playing career means he is happy to spend some time away from the sport's firing line.\nAnd although a year out may mean a clean break from your profession for most, football has still featured prominently in Giggs' sabbatical-of-sorts.\n\"Life's good. I've just completed my first year without football and it's been good,\" he says.\n\"I've been really busy doing some TV work for the Euros when I finished, then I went to India playing futsal, then a bit more punditry, doing some work for Uefa as a technical observer, which is good keeping me in football, and then just doing the normal dad stuff, watching your son play football, and watching Salford City, who I'm co-owner of. So it's been really busy and really good.\n\"You find out there's a whole big old world out there outside football, so I'm enjoying it.\n\"I think the pressure you put yourself under, be it as a player or a coach, that pressure's sort of come off. It's a strange feeling but it's good.\n\"I'm exactly where I was last summer, more or less got the next six months planned but, with the chance if a club does come in and want to talk, then I can do that.\"\nWhile being football-centric, what the last 12 months have given Giggs is some time away from the pressure cooker of the Premier League and its myriad, relentless demands.\nThat breathing space has allowed the Welshman to contemplate his options, speak to former managers - Sir Alex Ferguson most regularly - and also learn from coaches of other sports.\n\"Rugby is a big love for me because my dad [Danny Wilson] played rugby and I'm a rugby fan, whether it be league or union,\" Giggs says.\n\"I know Rob Howley [former Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half and current assistant coach], I've met Warren Gatland [Wales and Lions head coach], I've spent an evening next to Eddie Jones [England head coach], who was constantly asking me about football - it was brilliant.\n\"I was asking him all about his coaching career, but he was asking me more about football and Sir Alex.\"\nGiggs appears to be refreshed by his time off, chatting excitedly about the previous 12 months and his future managerial career.\nSo does a 'gap year' like this revitalise one's passion for football?\n\"I think it does,\" Giggs says.\n\"It's brilliant I can step out because I was two years as a coach, you're constantly putting yourself under pressure, you're always thinking how you can improve the team, so to step away from it and be a bit more relaxed, you can look at things in a different way.\n\"I think I am ready [to return] but, also, I'm enjoying life and busy doing other stuff. If it happens then great, I'm ready because I've prepared myself as best I could with all my badges and the two years under Louis [van Gaal] at United.\n\"Whether that be in the lower leagues or a foreign club, I don't know. I honestly don't know and that's exciting for me because I've enjoyed this last year. But at some stage, I'm sure I will be back in football, coaching or managing.\"\n\nSummary:\nA little over a decade has passed since Ryan Giggs' final game for Wales yet, even at 43 years old, the former Manchester United winger can still be devilishly elusive.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Croatia\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

David Paterson of New York has told state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states and countries where they are legal, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. The governor's legal counsel told state agencies in a May 14 memo to revise policies and regulations to recognize same-sex marriages performed in California and Massachusetts as well as Canada and other countries that allow gays and lesbians to marry, said Erin Duggan, the governor's spokeswoman. The memo informed state agencies that failing to recognize gay marriages would violate the New York's human rights law, Duggan said. The directive follows a February ruling from a New York state appeals court. That decision says that legal same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions are entitled to recognition in New York. \"This was in direct response to a court ruling,\" Duggan told CNN. \"Just to make sure all the state agencies are on the same page.\"  See what rules your state has about same-sex unions \u00bb . Duggan says that the court's decision was consistent with the findings of several lower courts in New York State. The governor's legal counsel sent the memo one day before the California Supreme Court struck down a ban on gay marriage in that state. Court officials in California counties may begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 17, state officials said Wednesday. Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriages in 2004, and gay couples need not be state residents there to wed. However, then-Gov. Mitt Romney resurrected a 1913 law barring non-resident marriages in the state if the marriage would be prohibited in the partners' home state. Subsequent court and agency decisions have determined that only residents of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Mexico may marry in Massachusetts, unless the parties say they plan to move there after the marriage. New Hampshire, Vermont, New Jersey and Connecticut permit civil unions, while California has a domestic-partner registration law. More than a dozen other states give same-sex couples some legal rights, as do some other countries.\n\nSummary:\nGov.

So, I sent her a message asking if she would like to meet up while I'm in Japan. She seemed happy and excited about the idea, but now she's been left me on read for a few days.\nI'm starting to feel a bit confused and worried that maybe she's not interested in meeting up after all. Maybe she just said yes to be nice, but didn't really mean it. Or maybe she's just really busy and can't make it work. I'm trying not to overthink it, but it's hard not to wonder what's going on.\nI've been thinking about our conversations and interactions, trying to figure out if there's anything that could have changed her mind. We had been talking about meeting up for a while, and she seemed really enthusiastic about it. But maybe I misread the situation, or maybe something came up that's making it difficult for her to meet up.\nI'm trying to be patient and not jump to conclusions, but it's hard not to feel a bit disappointed and confused. I really was looking forward to seeing her again and catching up. I'm hoping that she'll get back to me soon and we can figure out a plan. Maybe we can even make some new memories together.\nAs I continue to wait for her response, I'm trying to focus on the positive aspects of our friendship and the good times we had together. I'm grateful for the experience and the memories we created, and I hope that we can still have a strong connection despite the distance and busy schedules.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"u\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "u"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "u"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "u"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "e"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "1", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "e"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The use of computational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single ventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of pacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the biomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing in clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In practice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each other's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD) the main steps involved in performing\n\nText continuation:\ncomputational simulations.\nThe first step is to define the problem and identify the specific clinical question being addressed. This requires a thorough understanding of the patient's anatomy and physiology, as well as the relevant clinical data. Next, the computational model is developed, which involves creating a digital representation of the patient's heart and blood vessels. This is typically done using specialized software and involves a range of techniques, including finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics.\nOnce the model is developed, it can be used to simulate various scenarios and predict the outcomes of different treatments. This allows clinicians to test different approaches and make informed decisions about the best course of action. The simulations can also be used to identify potential complications and develop strategies for mitigating them.\nIn addition to its clinical applications, computational simulation can also be used to advance our understanding of the underlying biology of congenital heart disease. For example, simulations can be used to study the effects of genetic mutations on heart development and function, or to investigate the role of environmental factors in the development of CHD.\nOverall, the use of computational simulation in the study of congenital heart disease has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach diagnosis and treatment. By providing a powerful tool for predicting outcomes and identifying potential complications, simulations can help clinicians make more informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"w\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The use of computational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single ventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of pacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the biomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing in clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In practice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each other's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD) the main steps involved in performing\n\nText continuation:\ncomputational simulation-from the selection of an appropriate clinical question/problem to understanding the computational results, and all of the \"black boxes\" in between. We examine the current state of the art and areas in need of continued development. For example, medical image-based model-building software has been developed based on numerous different methods. However, none of them can be used to construct a model with a simple \"click of a button\". The creation of a faithful, representative anatomic model, especially in pediatric subjects, often requires skilled manual intervention. In addition, information from a second imaging modality is often required to facilitate this process. We describe the technical aspects of model building, provide a definition of some of the most commonly used terms and techniques (e.g. meshes, mesh convergence, Navier-Stokes equations, and boundary conditions), and the assumptions used in running the simulations. Particular attention is paid to the assignment of boundary conditions as this point is of critical importance in the current areas of research within the realm of congenital heart disease. Finally, examples are provided demonstrating how computer simulations can provide an opportunity to \"acquire\" data currently unobtainable by other modalities, with essentially no risk to patients. To illustrate these points, novel simulation examples of virtual Fontan conversion (from preoperative data to predicted postoperative state) and outcomes of different surgical designs are presented. The need for validation of the currently employed techniques and predicted results are required and the methods remain in their infancy. While the daily application of these technologies to patient-specific clinical scenarios likely remains years away, the ever increasing interest in this area among both clinicians and engineers makes its eventual use far more likely than ever before and, some could argue, only a matter of [computing] time.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Oman\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

German and Japanese warships and submarines entered Australian waters between 1940 and 1945 and attacked ships, ports and other targets. Among the best-known attacks are the sinking of HMAS Sydney by a German raider in November 1941, the bombing of Darwin by Japanese naval aircraft in February 1942, and the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour in May 1942. About 40 Allied merchant ships were damaged or sunk off the Australian coast by surface raiders, submarines and mines. Japanese submarines also shelled three Australian ports and submarine-based aircraft flew over several Australian capital cities.\nThe Axis threat to Australia\n\nText continuation:\nwas a significant concern for the Australian government and military. In response, Australia implemented a range of measures to defend its coastline and shipping lanes. These included the establishment of coastal patrols, the deployment of anti-submarine warfare vessels, and the implementation of convoy systems to protect merchant ships. Additionally, Australia worked closely with its allies, including the United States, to share intelligence and coordinate naval operations.\nDespite these efforts, the Axis threat remained a significant challenge for Australia throughout the war. The country's remote location made it difficult to detect and respond to enemy attacks, and the Japanese and German navies were able to exploit this to launch surprise attacks on Australian targets. However, the Australian military and government were able to adapt and respond to these challenges, and the country played an important role in the Allied war effort. The Axis threat to Australia ultimately subsided in 1945, following the defeat of Germany and Japan, but the war had a lasting impact on the country's military and naval capabilities, as well as its national identity and sense of purpose.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"g\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The level of Axis naval activity peaked in the first half of 1942 when Japanese submarines conducted anti-shipping patrols off Australia's coast, and Japanese naval aviation attacked several towns in northern Australia. The Japanese submarine offensive against Australia was renewed in the first half of 1943 but was broken off as the Allies pushed the Japanese onto the defensive. Few Axis naval vessels operated in Australian waters in 1944 and 1945, and those that did had only a limited impact.\nDue to the episodic nature of the Axis attacks and the relatively small number of ships and submarines committed, Germany and Japan were not successful in disrupting Australian shipping. While the Allies were forced to deploy substantial assets to defend shipping in Australian waters, this did not have a significant impact on the Australian war effort or American-led operations in the South West Pacific Area.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Kyrgyzstan\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

One thing that really stuck out to me is that most restrooms here don't have paper towels or an electric hand dryer.  I didn't really know what to think, and I spent the first few weeks drying my hands on my hair, (killing two birds with one stone by conveniently styling it at the same time, haha) or on my pants.  Then I happened to be in the bathroom at the same time as one of my coworkers and I had to wait while he washed his hands before me.  Lo and behold, he pulls a handkerchief out of his pocket and dries his hands before leaving...  I was speechless!  Such a simple solution that solves many problems and is\n\nText continuation:\nnot only eco-friendly but also practical.\nI couldn't help but wonder why we don't use handkerchiefs more often in the West.  I mean, it's not like we don't have them, but for some reason, we've become so accustomed to using paper towels and electric hand dryers that it seems like a foreign concept to carry a small piece of cloth around with us.  And yet, it's so effective!  No more wasting paper, no more energy consumption, no more awkward moments when you're trying to dry your hands in a public restroom.  It's a win-win situation!\nAs I continued to observe my coworkers and the locals, I noticed that they all carried handkerchiefs with them, not just for drying their hands but also for wiping their noses, cleaning their faces, and even as a makeshift bandage if needed.  It was amazing to see how versatile and resourceful they were with such a simple tool.  And it got me thinking, why can't we do the same?  Why can't we adopt this simple yet effective habit and make a positive impact on our environment?\nI started carrying a handkerchief with me and I have to say, it's been a game-changer.  I no longer worry about running out of paper towels or having to search for a public restroom with an electric hand dryer.  I just carry my trusty handkerchief and I'm good to go.  And the best part is, it's not just about the environment; it's also about being more mindful and present in the moment.  When you're carrying a handkerchief, you're more aware of your surroundings, more aware of your body and your needs, and more aware of the simple pleasures in life.\nI know it may seem like a small change, but trust me, it's a big deal.  It's a small step towards a more sustainable future, a more mindful present, and a more resourceful you.  So, next time you're in a public restroom and you're tempted to reach for the paper towels, remember the handkerchief and the simple yet effective solution it provides.  You never know, you might just start a revolution!\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"i\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "1", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Such a simple solution that solves many problems and is\n\nText continuation:\nenvironmentally friendly as well.  Think about how many rolls of paper towel are used in every US bathroom every year...  Long story short - carry a handkerchief to dry your hands instead of using paper towels.  Other benefits include:  wiping your brow while performing stressful tasks, use as a pocket square in a pinch (if it looks nice and isn't too dirty), or blowing your nose when absolutely necessary.\nClintHammer: How is that environmentally friendly?  Paper is a farmed product.  The trees they grow for paper are grown for paper.  If you reduce demand for paper, you reduce the number of trees.\nThe only reason people say paper is bad for the environment is because to make the nice white paper that people like to print things on, the pulp has to be thoroughly treated with chemicals.  Brown men's room towels don't.  \nAlso your \"lifehack\" is carry a handkercheif?  That's not what a lifehack is, you dope.  That's a \"thing I like to do\" \nsupersasuke: I get your point about paper being a farmed product and that cutting down on using tons of it in bathrooms might not technically be any better for the environment, however, I was merely pointing out a very simple (maybe obvious) use of a handkerchief that anyone can choose to start implementing.  I also want to point out that cutting down on the amount of paper towels used will reduce the amount of plastic trash bags used in bathrooms as well, because without the trash constantly filling up, there is less of a need to empty it regularly.  My observation was simply that I never see people in the US carrying or using handkerchiefs, and it seems to be a staple EDC item in India.  I'm sorry if I offended your definition of a \"lifehack\", I just wanted to point out a difference in culture that I noticed that may appeal to certain people who don't find satisfaction in wiping their hands on paper towels every time they visit a restroom...\nClintHammer: &gt; I was merely pointing out a very simple (maybe obvious) use of a handkerchief\n\nYeah, you suggested someone use something for its intended purpose. \nhttp://i.imgur.com/OFi6aaV.png \nsupersasuke: You got me.  I guess I thought it might be worth it because I don't see many people using them at all...

Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, pictured late last month during a visit to France. The attack happened while the plane was about to take off from Mogadishu's airport Sunday around 11 a.m. local time, spokesman Hussien Mohammed Huubsireb said. \"Al-Shaabab has actually tried to harm to president, but thank God nobody was hurt,\" Huubsireb said. Al-Shaabab is an Islamic militia that is trying to seize control of Somalia. It is a splinter group of the Islamic Courts Union, which ousted Somalia's transitional government in 2006. The ICU was deposed in December of that year following Ethiopia's military invasion. Bloody battles between Al-Shaabab and the Ethiopian-backed government forces in Mogadishu have forced residents to flee the capital. More than 40,000 displaced civilians have taken shelter in dozens of makeshift settlements west of Mogadishu, described by the United Nations as \"precarious conditions.\" Sunday's mortar attack is the second assassination attempt on Ahmed. The president survived a car bombing in September 2006 outside Somalia's parliament in Baidoa that killed at least eight others. Somalia's Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi has been more frequently targeted by the Islamic insurgents seeking to destabilize the government. Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting.

Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, pictured late last month during a visit to France. The attack happened while the plane was about to take off from Mogadishu's airport Sunday around 11 a.m. local time, spokesman Hussien Mohammed Huubsireb said. \"Al-Shaabab has actually tried to harm to president, but thank God nobody was hurt,\" Huubsireb said. Al-Shaabab is an Islamic militia that is trying to seize control of Somalia. It is a splinter group of the Islamic Courts Union, which ousted Somalia's transitional government in 2006. The ICU was deposed in December of that year following Ethiopia's military invasion. Bloody battles between Al-Shaabab and the Ethiopian-backed government forces in Mogadishu have forced residents to flee the capital. More than 40,000 displaced civilians have taken shelter in dozens of makeshift settlements west of Mogadishu, described by the United Nations as \"precarious conditions.\" Sunday's mortar attack is the second assassination attempt on Ahmed. The president survived a car bombing in September 2006 outside Somalia's parliament in Baidoa that killed at least eight others. Somalia's Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi has been more frequently targeted by the Islamic insurgents seeking to destabilize the government. Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. Somalia's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital, with the help of the better-equipped Ethiopian forces. But the presence of the Ethiopians has united various Islamic militant groups in Somalia, including Al-Shaabab, who are trying to oust the Ethiopian forces and gain control of Mogadishu. The United States classified Al-Shaabab as a terrorist organization in March, partly because of what Washington says is the group's close ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda militant group.\n\nSummary:\nSuspected Islamic rebels fire at a plane carrying Somalia's transitional president\nPlane attacked as about to take off from Mogadishu, no injuries reported\nAttack is the second assassination attempt on Ahmed after car bomb in 2006\nSomalia in chaos since 1991, when warlords deposed dictator Mohamed Siad Barre\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Lebanon\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nOutput only the letter corresponding to your choice.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer11_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult1": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer12_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer11_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "The"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "There"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer15_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer17_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}}}]
