Fury at Labour government's \u00a31m compensation for innocent Brit\".\nHe said the man's release in 2004 had \"followed a Parliamentary and massive media campaign led by the Daily Mail... and strongly supported by the then Conservative Opposition\".\nThe former PM continued: \"He was not paid compensation by my government.

Fury at Labour government's \u00a31m compensation for innocent Brit\".\nHe said the man's release in 2004 had \"followed a Parliamentary and massive media campaign led by the Daily Mail... and strongly supported by the then Conservative Opposition\".\nThe former PM continued: \"He was not paid compensation by my government. The compensation was agreed in 2010 by the [coalition] government...\"\nLord Blunkett, who was home secretary at the time of al-Harith's release, said he had never campaigned for his return, but \"fully accepted that the situation of British citizens held without trial there, was unsustainable and legally and morally indefensible\".\nThe government in 2004 had \"acted responsibly\" he said, adding that \"public controversy\" at the time had been about whether enough was being done to release detainees \"and not the wisdom of providing balanced reassurance\".\nLord Blunkett said those returning from Guantanamo Bay were kept under surveillance and monitored by the security services.\nJack Straw, who was foreign secretary in 2004, said he \"never regarded\" al-Harith as innocent \"and neither Mr Blair nor I ever said that he was innocent\".\n\"We judged that the risk was not so great as to prevent his release.\n\"Whenever you're making decisions about the release of prisoners you have to make a judgement, and sometimes those judgements are not borne out by events.\"\nLeon Jameson, al-Harith's older brother, says they last spoke two years ago on the phone, before he went to Syria.\nMr Jameson described his sibling as \"fun\" when he was growing up and \"always helping other people\".\nWhen asked about his brother's suicide bombing he said: \"I can't actually commend him about it because it isn't right, but he's done it.

It's been great working with you,\" she said afterwards.\n\"We work really hard but we also have fun.\"\nBrengle, the world number 84, was a surprise finalist having come through qualifying, but the 24-year-old made the early running in the final.\nAfter a rain-interrupted semi-final there was another early shower on Saturday, and Watson then survived a 14-minute opening service game that included six break points.\nThe service struggles continued in the wind and Watson twice fell a break behind but was able to hit back immediately each time, levelling at 3-3 after a scrappy 44 minutes.\nWatson then made the decisive move as she reeled off three games to take the set, and after a steadier start to the second she went ahead again at 4-3.\nThere was a hint of nerves when she slipped 15-30 behind while serving for the match, but Watson closed out the win and headed to the stands to hug coach Veronelli.\n\"When I won Osaka in 2012, it was more of a surprise,\" said Watson. \"But here, I feel like I belong.\n\"I'm obviously very happy. It was tough conditions again today, very windy, and I knew Madison would be tough - we know each other very well on and off the court, and we practise a lot in Florida.\n\"It really was my toughest match of the week.

He gifted an opportunity and it is another one to put in the list of failures.\n\"He looks in two minds at the crease, unsure whether to go for the full-on aggressive shot or a checked drive.\"\nHales, who has passed 50 only once in seven innings in the series, is the eighth opening partner for Cook since the retirement of former skipper Andrew Strauss in 2012.\nThe current captain showed a welcome return to form, however, looking assured in his first fifty of the series - and the 47th of his Test career - and is only 50 short of becoming the first England player to score 10,000 Test runs.\nJoe Root edged a delivery fractionally short of De Kock behind the stumps as the occasional ball misbehaved but England's two leading batsmen put on 60 to take them to the close without further loss.\nHaving reprieved centurions Stephen Cook and Hashim Amla with dropped catches on day one, England were guilty of further errors in the field as South Africa pressed on to a commanding first innings total.\nIn only the third over of the day De Kock scythed James Anderson to gully where a diving Ben Stokes could not grasp the chance.\nOn 80, De Kock edged the luckless Chris Woakes and bisected wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and wide first slip Alastair Cook, neither of whom went for the catch.\nTen runs later, De Kock's drive at Moeen Ali went through the hands of Cook at short extra-cover.\nThe left-hander played an array of shots all around the wicket and was particularly severe on Moeen Ali.\nHe scored 45 runs off the spinner in only 28 balls, including two mighty leg-side sixes, one of which nearly landed on a cameraman behind the long-on boundary.\nFormer South Africa wicketkeeper Mark Boucher: \"The pitch is not going to get any better; those cracks are going to widen. Batting from now on is going to be hard graft. In the last innings it will be a real lottery.\n\"You do feel that if South Africa get it right in a session, they will do some proper damage.

He gifted an opportunity and it is another one to put in the list of failures.\n\"He looks in two minds at the crease, unsure whether to go for the full-on aggressive shot or a checked drive.\"\nHales, who has passed 50 only once in seven innings in the series, is the eighth opening partner for Cook since the retirement of former skipper Andrew Strauss in 2012.\nThe current captain showed a welcome return to form, however, looking assured in his first fifty of the series - and the 47th of his Test career - and is only 50 short of becoming the first England player to score 10,000 Test runs.\nJoe Root edged a delivery fractionally short of De Kock behind the stumps as the occasional ball misbehaved but England's two leading batsmen put on 60 to take them to the close without further loss.\nHaving reprieved centurions Stephen Cook and Hashim Amla with dropped catches on day one, England were guilty of further errors in the field as South Africa pressed on to a commanding first innings total.\nIn only the third over of the day De Kock scythed James Anderson to gully where a diving Ben Stokes could not grasp the chance.\nOn 80, De Kock edged the luckless Chris Woakes and bisected wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and wide first slip Alastair Cook, neither of whom went for the catch.\nTen runs later, De Kock's drive at Moeen Ali went through the hands of Cook at short extra-cover.\nThe left-hander played an array of shots all around the wicket and was particularly severe on Moeen Ali.\nHe scored 45 runs off the spinner in only 28 balls, including two mighty leg-side sixes, one of which nearly landed on a cameraman behind the long-on boundary.\nFormer South Africa wicketkeeper Mark Boucher: \"The pitch is not going to get any better; those cracks are going to widen. Batting from now on is going to be hard graft. In the last innings it will be a real lottery.\n\"You do feel that if South Africa get it right in a session, they will do some proper damage. You could have a session where England go 60-4.\"\nEx-England skipper Michael Vaughan: \"There's going to be more low bounce over the next three days. You're under a lot of pressure when a team gets 475 on the board - you're only one bad session away from losing the match.\n\"If England get out of this Test with something, they'll have done brilliantly.\"\n\nSummary 1:\nSouth Africa's Quinton de Kock scored 129 not out as his team made 475 in their first innings, while England's Alastair Cook held firm with 67 in response.\n\nSummary 2:\nQuinton de Kock's maiden Test century put South Africa in command of the final Test as England closed day two in Centurion 337 runs behind on 138-2.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

He is currently not hosting the show.\nGiving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Fox said he had worked with \"hundreds\" of female colleagues during his career, but had never been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour until last year.\nUnder questioning from his defence counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, he told the court his teams had kept their energy up during live broadcasts by playing loud music, dancing and creating makeshift obstacle courses.\n\"It sounds daft, but it was the way we, I, got myself going, and the team would join in very much as well. They would be part of that.\"\nHe said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a \"full performance\" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another.\nMr Caplan asked: \"Could those comments become edgy or sexual?\"\nMr Fox replied: \"Of course they could. Like any office. Some of it could be saucy, cheeky, over-the-top.\"\nReferring to the \"horseplay\" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, \"otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio\".\nAsked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: \"I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it?\n\"Laws have changed. HR has changed. Political correctness has changed.\"\nHe added: \"But I don't think my behaviour has changed. I'm the same guy now, with the same morals, as I was then.\"\nOne former colleague has accused the DJ of squeezing her breasts from behind.

Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nMr Fox, 54, from London, denies eight counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault between 1988 and 2014.\nHe said there was often \"horseplay\" with colleagues, involving \"piggybacks, tickling and squeezing\".\nBut he told Westminster Magistrates' Court such behaviour was consensual.\nMr Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, became well known for presenting the chart show on Capital Radio, and was a judge on the ITV show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell.\nHe joined Magic 105.4 in 2005, where he presents the breakfast show, Foxy in the Morning. He is currently not hosting the show.\nGiving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Fox said he had worked with \"hundreds\" of female colleagues during his career, but had never been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour until last year.\nUnder questioning from his defence counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, he told the court his teams had kept their energy up during live broadcasts by playing loud music, dancing and creating makeshift obstacle courses.\n\"It sounds daft, but it was the way we, I, got myself going, and the team would join in very much as well. They would be part of that.\"\nHe said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a \"full performance\" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another.\nMr Caplan asked: \"Could those comments become edgy or sexual?\"\nMr Fox replied: \"Of course they could. Like any office. Some of it could be saucy, cheeky, over-the-top.\"\nReferring to the \"horseplay\" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, \"otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio\".\nAsked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: \"I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it?\n\"Laws have changed. HR has changed. Political correctness has changed.\"\nHe added: \"But I don't think my behaviour has changed. I'm the same guy now, with the same morals, as I was then.\"\nOne former colleague has accused the DJ of squeezing her breasts from behind. Asked about that, he said: \"That would be wholly wrong, totally disrespectful, and it's not something I would do.\"\nThe complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also said Mr Fox once pushed her over and simulated having sex with her.\nAddressing that allegation, he said people in his then-workplace often pretended to have been caught in compromising positions - it was a \"play-acting high jinks thing\", he said.\nMr Fox told the court he had seen it \"many times\", but agreed that out of context, the \"Benny Hill-style\" comedy could have seemed inappropriate.\nProsecutor John Price QC said: \"She says that when you did that to her, she did not consent to it.

He does not normally like being in areas of the pitch where he cannot affect the game in a positive way.\nBut obviously he was asked to play a different role by Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat because of their circumstances and he did a brilliant job for the team.\nI have never seen Defoe work as hard as he did to contribute defensively on Sunday - he tracked back on the left too and at one point he was making sliding tackles near his own corner flag, which was a first.\nHe is 32 now and he will not want to be doing that permanently. But knowing him like I do, if he is asked to do any kind of job for his team to help them stay in the Premier League then he will always give it his all.\nI do not think playing him there gets the best out of him, but it worked for Sunderland on Sunday.\nUltimately, Defoe only had one shot at goal in his 80 minutes on the pitch, but it was a world-class finish to win Sunderland the game and three vital points.\nThat is what they signed him for, and you could see from his celebration how much it meant to him.\nI have played in midfield behind Defoe and he is a very special talent in that he does not solely rely on through-balls.\nIf you get the ball to his feet, he has got the capability around the box to beat people himself and shoot from range with real power.\nDefoe has pace and thrives on being put through too of course, but one of the reasons he has scored as many goals as he has done in his career is that there are so many different elements to his game.\nYes he will get in the six-yard box to score you a tap-in but he can create goals for himself and, as Newcastle found out, score from distance as well.\nBefore that goal, he had not scored for six games which will have been hurting him because he is not used to it.\nBut I know that it will not have knocked his confidence because he is the sort of player that never loses faith in himself, and for good reason.\nThat bit of class he produced against Newcastle was the kind of moment of brilliance I have come to expect from him after playing with and against him down the years.\nDefoe's appetite was typical of the rest of the Sunderland team.\nWhat Dick Advocaat's side lack in quality, they make up for in physicality and endeavour which is a massive positive for them.\nThey have got some powerful players and they look fit, which is an often overlooked factor at this stage of the season.\nAgainst Newcastle, both of their full-backs - Billy Jones and Patrick van Aanholt - did brilliantly, flying up the wings.\nThey also have a few clever players, like Jordi Gomez and Seb Larsson, who have been in this position at the bottom of the table before and will be used to the pressure involved when you are fighting relegation.\nFrom what I saw of them in this game, they have got enough about them to beat the drop.\nBut that is mainly because of the quality Defoe gives them in the final third.

He does not normally like being in areas of the pitch where he cannot affect the game in a positive way.\nBut obviously he was asked to play a different role by Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat because of their circumstances and he did a brilliant job for the team.\nI have never seen Defoe work as hard as he did to contribute defensively on Sunday - he tracked back on the left too and at one point he was making sliding tackles near his own corner flag, which was a first.\nHe is 32 now and he will not want to be doing that permanently. But knowing him like I do, if he is asked to do any kind of job for his team to help them stay in the Premier League then he will always give it his all.\nI do not think playing him there gets the best out of him, but it worked for Sunderland on Sunday.\nUltimately, Defoe only had one shot at goal in his 80 minutes on the pitch, but it was a world-class finish to win Sunderland the game and three vital points.\nThat is what they signed him for, and you could see from his celebration how much it meant to him.\nI have played in midfield behind Defoe and he is a very special talent in that he does not solely rely on through-balls.\nIf you get the ball to his feet, he has got the capability around the box to beat people himself and shoot from range with real power.\nDefoe has pace and thrives on being put through too of course, but one of the reasons he has scored as many goals as he has done in his career is that there are so many different elements to his game.\nYes he will get in the six-yard box to score you a tap-in but he can create goals for himself and, as Newcastle found out, score from distance as well.\nBefore that goal, he had not scored for six games which will have been hurting him because he is not used to it.\nBut I know that it will not have knocked his confidence because he is the sort of player that never loses faith in himself, and for good reason.\nThat bit of class he produced against Newcastle was the kind of moment of brilliance I have come to expect from him after playing with and against him down the years.\nDefoe's appetite was typical of the rest of the Sunderland team.\nWhat Dick Advocaat's side lack in quality, they make up for in physicality and endeavour which is a massive positive for them.\nThey have got some powerful players and they look fit, which is an often overlooked factor at this stage of the season.\nAgainst Newcastle, both of their full-backs - Billy Jones and Patrick van Aanholt - did brilliantly, flying up the wings.\nThey also have a few clever players, like Jordi Gomez and Seb Larsson, who have been in this position at the bottom of the table before and will be used to the pressure involved when you are fighting relegation.\nFrom what I saw of them in this game, they have got enough about them to beat the drop.\nBut that is mainly because of the quality Defoe gives them in the final third.

And, although the first half was pretty turgid, we've got the job done in the end.\"\nWasps captain James Haskell told BBC Sport:\n\"It was a great way to start here. We've finished one chapter and started a new one.\n\"It took us 55 minutes to really get going, but we were disciplined and controlled. We just hope we've done enough to make people want to come back here and watch us again.\"\nLondon Irish coach Brian Smith:\n\"We knew what to expect and we made a decent fist of it, but we're disappointed with the blow-out at the back end.\n\"I don't want to take anything away from Wasps, as this was their day, but we have a frustrated group of players in the dressing room.\n\"When a young ref gets a crack in front of a big crowd, you are concerned.

And, although the first half was pretty turgid, we've got the job done in the end.\"\nWasps captain James Haskell told BBC Sport:\n\"It was a great way to start here. We've finished one chapter and started a new one.\n\"It took us 55 minutes to really get going, but we were disciplined and controlled. We just hope we've done enough to make people want to come back here and watch us again.\"\nLondon Irish coach Brian Smith:\n\"We knew what to expect and we made a decent fist of it, but we're disappointed with the blow-out at the back end.\n\"I don't want to take anything away from Wasps, as this was their day, but we have a frustrated group of players in the dressing room.\n\"When a young ref gets a crack in front of a big crowd, you are concerned. The penalty count was 10-2 at half-time and you have to hope it levels out, but it didn't. But you just have to wear it and move on.\n\"You have to applaud Wasps for their enterprise in making this move up here to Coventry and good luck to them.\"\nWasps: Masi; Wade, Daly, Bell, Tagicakibau; Goode, Simpson; Mullan, Shervington, Cooper-Woolley; Davies, Gaskell; Johnson, Haskell (capt), Hughes.\nReplacements: Lindsay, McIntyre, Cittadini, Myall, Jones, Davies, Lozowski, Miller.\nLondon Irish: Homer; Ojo, Griffin, Sheridan, Fenby; Geraghty, Steele; Court, Paice, Cross, Skivington (capt), Cox, Sinclair, Cowan, Narraway.\nReplacements: Allen, Halavatau, Aulika, Leo, Gilsenan, Allinson, Noakes, Lewington.\nSin Bin: Paice (61).\nAttendance: 28,254\nReferee: Tom Foley (RFU).\n\nSummary 1:\nAndy Goode scored 33 points, including a try and eight penalties, as Wasps defeated London Irish 36-16 in a Premiership match at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry.\n\nSummary 2:\nAndy Goode set a new Premiership points record on his home patch as Wasps overpowered London Irish to make a dream start to life at the Ricoh Arena.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

I have a fairly low tolerance for idiots,\" Senator Leyonhjelm told the BBC from his offices in Sydney.\n\"It was fairly idiotic email, so I wrote back to her and called her a bimbo.  I had no idea [but] it turns out she is in her 70s or 80s or something like that and she complained to this sports writer.\"\n\"He contacted my office and asked for a comment and one of my staff replied we had no comment for him about the particular matter but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 said 'well, usually he [the Senator] tells people like that to [profanity]-off, and he didn't in this case, so we're worried that he is mellowing.\n\"Apparently that enraged this guy.\"\nIt sure did. A fired-up FitzSimons added that \"with such personal abuse, the Senator disgraces the office he holds\".\nThis is not the first time the Liberal Democratic MP has been castigated in the press. In August, the Herald labelled him a \"hate-speech apologist\" and \"a boorish, supercilious know-all with the empathy of a [concrete] besser block\".\nAt issue is the senator's push to repeal section 18C of Australia's Racial Discrimination Act, which outlaws behaviour that is likely to \"offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate\" someone because of their race or ethnicity. Here is where he channels memories of \"Chopper\" Read, who died in 2013 after serving 23 years in jail in Australia for kidnapping and malicious wounding.\n\"Our right to free speech is not a frivolous matter, but it is time for sooks and whingers to take a leaf from Chopper. It's not the government's job to protect us from hurt feelings,\" Senator Leyonhjelm said on his official website.\nFeelings were certainly singed following a tweet soon after the death from cancer of the celebrated sports journalist Rebecca Wilson.\n\"Doubt there'll be many #WSW [Western Sydney Wanderers] fans at Rebecca Wilson's funeral #innocentlivesdamaged,\" he tweeted in reference to the late reporter's identification of fans allegedly on a banned list for poor behaviour, most of whom were followers of Western Sydney Wanderers.\n\"He takes bluntness to a higher level. He can be obscene at times but it is in Australia's more rough and tumble tradition,\" explained Dr Peter Chen, senior lecturer in the department of government and international relations at the University of Sydney.\n\"He originally was a member of the Labor Party.

Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nDavid Leyonhjelm, a cat-loving former veterinarian and Liberal Democratic senator for New South Wales, has twice been elected to federal parliament, and is one of a disparate group of cross-benchers who hold the balance of power in an unpredictable upper house.\nHe is his libertarian party's sole representative in Canberra, and has been branded \"the nastiest, most sexist politician in Australia\" by Sydney Morning Herald columnist Peter FitzSimons.\nFitzSimons, a former rugby union international, told his readers a story about an elderly female reader who had taken exception to the senator's relaxed view on Donald Trump's crass remarks about women.\nShe complained and received a brusque response saying she was \"not fit to use a computer\".\n\"Apparently a constituent wrote to me and made some fairly silly remarks.  I have a fairly low tolerance for idiots,\" Senator Leyonhjelm told the BBC from his offices in Sydney.\n\"It was fairly idiotic email, so I wrote back to her and called her a bimbo.  I had no idea [but] it turns out she is in her 70s or 80s or something like that and she complained to this sports writer.\"\n\"He contacted my office and asked for a comment and one of my staff replied we had no comment for him about the particular matter but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 said 'well, usually he [the Senator] tells people like that to [profanity]-off, and he didn't in this case, so we're worried that he is mellowing.\n\"Apparently that enraged this guy.\"\nIt sure did. A fired-up FitzSimons added that \"with such personal abuse, the Senator disgraces the office he holds\".\nThis is not the first time the Liberal Democratic MP has been castigated in the press. In August, the Herald labelled him a \"hate-speech apologist\" and \"a boorish, supercilious know-all with the empathy of a [concrete] besser block\".\nAt issue is the senator's push to repeal section 18C of Australia's Racial Discrimination Act, which outlaws behaviour that is likely to \"offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate\" someone because of their race or ethnicity. Here is where he channels memories of \"Chopper\" Read, who died in 2013 after serving 23 years in jail in Australia for kidnapping and malicious wounding.\n\"Our right to free speech is not a frivolous matter, but it is time for sooks and whingers to take a leaf from Chopper. It's not the government's job to protect us from hurt feelings,\" Senator Leyonhjelm said on his official website.\nFeelings were certainly singed following a tweet soon after the death from cancer of the celebrated sports journalist Rebecca Wilson.\n\"Doubt there'll be many #WSW [Western Sydney Wanderers] fans at Rebecca Wilson's funeral #innocentlivesdamaged,\" he tweeted in reference to the late reporter's identification of fans allegedly on a banned list for poor behaviour, most of whom were followers of Western Sydney Wanderers.\n\"He takes bluntness to a higher level. He can be obscene at times but it is in Australia's more rough and tumble tradition,\" explained Dr Peter Chen, senior lecturer in the department of government and international relations at the University of Sydney.\n\"He originally was a member of the Labor Party. He joined the Liberal Party and he fell out with both sides of politics, most recently with his membership of the Liberal Party over the introduction of gun laws in Australia following the Port Arthur shooting about 20 years ago,\" Dr Chen added.\nSenator Leyonhjelm is broadly in favour of immigration, supports same-sex marriage, lower taxes and assisted suicide, but it's restrictions on firearms that make his blood boil.\n\"I find that distressing because it is wrong and it is very unkind to me and 800,000 licensed shooters in the country, who are absolutely vilified, treated like we are criminals-in-waiting and whose sporting implements are constantly under threat,\" he explained.\nHis critics argue that his stance on guns ignores the opinions of most Australians, who back tough laws.\n\"He is using extreme tactics to push through his quite dangerous agenda,\" said fellow New South Wales Senator Lee Rhiannon, from the Greens, who is her party's gun control spokesperson. \"He has been provocative, blunt, extreme, at times rude.\"\nShe concedes, however, that Senator Leyonhjelm and Pauline Hanson's right-wing anti-immigration One Nation Party are tapping into anti-establishment rage in Australia.\n\"We're seeing a real anger build up within the community with regard to machine politics, the political class, whatever name you want to call it, who are worried how their kids are going to buy a home and feeling left out of how society is working,\" Ms Rhiannon told the BBC.\n\"They think that globalisation has robbed them of a life that they think is fair.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats say they have recruited hundreds of disaffected former supporters of the governing Liberal Party and hope to mount a show of force at the next year's state election in Western Australia.\nThat campaign promises to be anything but dull.

Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nIn her resignation letter she said her decision would enable her party to have a \"real discussion\" about its future.\nSenior party members had \"questioned my place in this new phase\", she said.\nEarlier, the 56-year-old said some Labour MPs were \"dinosaurs\" who failed to see \"Scotland has changed forever\".\nMs Lamont had wanted more autonomy for the party in Scotland and significant new powers for the Scottish Parliament.\nBut in an interview with the Daily Record she accused Westminster colleagues of treating Scotland like a \"branch office\".\nLabour has 41 MPs in Scotland who will fight for their Westminster seats at next May's General Election. The party also has 38 MSPs in Edinburgh's Holyrood parliament and they will seek re-election in 2016.\nIn her resignation letter to Scottish Labour chairman Jamie Glackin Ms Lamont said the referendum had \"opened a new chapter in the debate about the future of the Scottish Labour Party\".\nShe added: \"In order that we can have the real discussion about how we take Scottish Labour forward, I believe it would be best if I took  myself out of the equation and stepped down as leader.\"\nShe described Labour's challenge in Scotland as \"serious\", but added \"I strongly believe that the Labour Party is not only our best chance of achieving a better, fairer Scotland, it's our only chance\".\nThere are two versions of this story.  In one version, Scottish Labour's departing leader, Johann Lamont, accuses her Westminster colleagues - and, by implication, Ed Miliband - of undermining her and failing to grasp how much Scotland has changed.  She says some of her MP colleagues are \"dinosaurs\".\nThe alternative version is that Johann Lamont wasn't up to the job - that she failed to counter the SNP, that she failed to modernise the party sufficiently to cope with a new Scotland where people are no longer prepared to back Labour as a duty, that she failed to attract new talent who might freshen up the party's portrait for the electorate in 2016, when Holyrood goes to the polls.\nReacting to news of the resignation, SNP deputy leader Nicola Sturgeon said that Ms Lamont \"carries my personal best wishes\".\nBut she added: \"There is no question that her shock resignation reveals Labour to be in complete meltdown in Scotland.\"\nMs Sturgeon said: \"The scale of the infighting between Scottish Labour and Labour at Westminster is exposed for all to see.\"\nThe timetable for choosing a new leader will be set out soon.\nIn the meantime, deputy leader Anas Sarwar is in charge and an MSP will be chosen to stand in for Ms Lamont at Holyrood.\nWhoever replaces her will become Scottish Labour's seventh leader since the Scottish Parliament was established 15 years ago.\nMs Lamont, a former English teacher who joined the Labour Party as a teenager, has represented the Glasgow Pollok constituency at Holyrood since 1999.\nShe took over as the party's Scottish leader in the aftermath of the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, when Labour suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the SNP.\nIn the weeks after the independence referendum, she said she wanted to lead Labour to victory in the next Holyrood election in 2016 and become first minister.\nLabour leader Ed Miliband said she deserved \"significant credit\" for the successful \"No\" vote in the Scottish referendum campaign.\nHe added: \"She campaigned the length and breadth of Scotland making the case for social justice within the United Kingdom.\n\"She has led the Scottish Labour Party with determination. I know she will continue to serve her constituents.\n\"Having elected a new leader, I believe the party will show the same will and determination it did in the referendum campaign to help us to victory in the general election of 2015 and the Scottish elections of 2016.\"\nFormer prime minister Gordon Brown has constantly been linked to the job, as has fellow MP Jim Murphy, who also played a prominent role in the referendum campaign.\nMr Brown said he was sorry to hear that Ms Lamont had resigned.\nHe added; \"She brought determination, compassion and a down-to-earth approach to the leadership and deserves great credit for taking on the challenge after 2011.\n\"I wish her well in the future.\"\nSenior Labour sources have indicated that both the former Prime minister, Gordon Brown and the former Scottish Secretary , Jim Murphy, will be approached to see if they are willing to lead the Labour Party in Scotland.\nIf the two men refuse another scenario being canvassed is for a joint ticket between the MP Anas Sarwar and the MSP Kezia Dugdale.\nMr Sarwar would be the leader and would seek to improve relations between Westminster and Holyrood.

The party also has 38 MSPs in Edinburgh's Holyrood parliament and they will seek re-election in 2016.\nIn her resignation letter to Scottish Labour chairman Jamie Glackin Ms Lamont said the referendum had \"opened a new chapter in the debate about the future of the Scottish Labour Party\".\nShe added: \"In order that we can have the real discussion about how we take Scottish Labour forward, I believe it would be best if I took  myself out of the equation and stepped down as leader.\"\nShe described Labour's challenge in Scotland as \"serious\", but added \"I strongly believe that the Labour Party is not only our best chance of achieving a better, fairer Scotland, it's our only chance\".\nThere are two versions of this story.  In one version, Scottish Labour's departing leader, Johann Lamont, accuses her Westminster colleagues - and, by implication, Ed Miliband - of undermining her and failing to grasp how much Scotland has changed.  She says some of her MP colleagues are \"dinosaurs\".\nThe alternative version is that Johann Lamont wasn't up to the job - that she failed to counter the SNP, that she failed to modernise the party sufficiently to cope with a new Scotland where people are no longer prepared to back Labour as a duty, that she failed to attract new talent who might freshen up the party's portrait for the electorate in 2016, when Holyrood goes to the polls.\nReacting to news of the resignation, SNP deputy leader Nicola Sturgeon said that Ms Lamont \"carries my personal best wishes\".\nBut she added: \"There is no question that her shock resignation reveals Labour to be in complete meltdown in Scotland.\"\nMs Sturgeon said: \"The scale of the infighting between Scottish Labour and Labour at Westminster is exposed for all to see.\"\nThe timetable for choosing a new leader will be set out soon.\nIn the meantime, deputy leader Anas Sarwar is in charge and an MSP will be chosen to stand in for Ms Lamont at Holyrood.\nWhoever replaces her will become Scottish Labour's seventh leader since the Scottish Parliament was established 15 years ago.\nMs Lamont, a former English teacher who joined the Labour Party as a teenager, has represented the Glasgow Pollok constituency at Holyrood since 1999.\nShe took over as the party's Scottish leader in the aftermath of the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, when Labour suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the SNP.\nIn the weeks after the independence referendum, she said she wanted to lead Labour to victory in the next Holyrood election in 2016 and become first minister.\nLabour leader Ed Miliband said she deserved \"significant credit\" for the successful \"No\" vote in the Scottish referendum campaign.\nHe added: \"She campaigned the length and breadth of Scotland making the case for social justice within the United Kingdom.\n\"She has led the Scottish Labour Party with determination. I know she will continue to serve her constituents.\n\"Having elected a new leader, I believe the party will show the same will and determination it did in the referendum campaign to help us to victory in the general election of 2015 and the Scottish elections of 2016.\"\nFormer prime minister Gordon Brown has constantly been linked to the job, as has fellow MP Jim Murphy, who also played a prominent role in the referendum campaign.\nMr Brown said he was sorry to hear that Ms Lamont had resigned.\nHe added; \"She brought determination, compassion and a down-to-earth approach to the leadership and deserves great credit for taking on the challenge after 2011.\n\"I wish her well in the future.\"\nSenior Labour sources have indicated that both the former Prime minister, Gordon Brown and the former Scottish Secretary , Jim Murphy, will be approached to see if they are willing to lead the Labour Party in Scotland.\nIf the two men refuse another scenario being canvassed is for a joint ticket between the MP Anas Sarwar and the MSP Kezia Dugdale.\nMr Sarwar would be the leader and would seek to improve relations between Westminster and Holyrood. Ms Dugdale  would lead the group at Holyrood. One Labour source described this as the \"ideal option\".\nOthers believe Mr Murphy should be encouraged to stand. One figure said that if \"Jim doesn't stand it will be a disaster\", but added he believed the shadow cabinet member could be persuaded.\n\nSummary 1:\nScottish Labour leader Johann Lamont has resigned saying senior party members had \"questioned\" her role amid the \"serious challenges\" faced by the party after September's referendum.\n\nSummary 2:\nJohann Lamont, the leader of the Scottish Labour Party, has resigned, citing a need for a \"real discussion\" about the party's future and criticizing Westminster colleagues for treating Scotland like a \"branch office\".\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nThe title pacesetters would always be able to recover from a bad result - but how would they cope with the exclusion of their firebrand top scorer after a training ground bust-up and suggestions of interest from China?\nChelsea gave their answer with an impressive 3-0 win at Leicester City that, combined with the weekend's other results, put them firmly back in control of their Premier League destiny.\nSo, after 21 games and another weekend of significant matches, how are the top six clubs shaping up?\nForm: Won 14 out of past 15.\nUpcoming fixtures: 22 January - Hull (home), 31 January - Liverpool (away), 4 February - Arsenal (home).\nConte will have demanded an instant Premier League response from his team after that 2-0 loss at White Hart Lane, which he rightly placed in context by pointing out it was inflicted by a quality side with title aspirations of their own.\nThe wildcard was provided by the sudden falling out with influential striker Costa that provided an unexpected backdrop to Saturday's events at the King Power Stadium and gave the first hint of dissent in Chelsea and Conte's camp this season.\nIn the end, the Italian boss was given the opportunity to prove the versatility and flexibility of his squad in Costa's absence as Willian, Eden Hazard and Pedro provided the attacking threat.\nIn the absence of any suggestion Blues owner Roman Abramovich will bow to pressure to sell in January, the priority now is to get the combustible Spain striker back on side and ensure any unrest does not spread.\nIf that can be done, then Chelsea can look back at a weekend where their title position was strengthened as they now stand seven points clear.\nVerdict: Back on track and clear title favourites.\nForm: Won past six.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Manchester City (away), 31 January - Sunderland (away), 4 February - Middlesbrough (home).\nMauricio Pochettino's side are a growing force in this title race and the 4-0 demolition of West Bromwich Albion was further evidence of their growing authority.\nIt was their sixth straight league win since their loss at Manchester United in December - and they have only lost two games out of 21.\nHarry Kane is firing on all cylinders, shown by his hat-trick against West Brom, and with Dele Alli scoring seven goals in his past five league games Spurs are starting to look the full package.\nThey ran out of steam towards the end of last season, but Pochettino is a top-class operator who will surely have learned his lesson and tailored his team's intense style accordingly.\nThe Argentine will still hope to avoid injuries and there is a real worry over influential defender Jan Vertonghen, who Pochettino fears has suffered a \"bad\" ankle injury.\nNext weekend's game at Manchester City will tell us even more about them.\nVerdict: Flew under the radar for a while but now right at the heart of the title race.\nForm: One defeat in past 19.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Swansea (home), 31 January - Chelsea (home), 4 February - Hull (away).\nLiverpool will be disappointed they could not hold on for victory at Manchester United on Sunday, but there is plenty of encouragement to take from their performance.\nThe disappointment will come because they were within six minutes of securing a win that would not only have inflicted even more damage on United, but also would have sent a strong message to those nearer the top of the table.\nIt is to the Reds' credit that they came so close to victory despite key men such as Philippe Coutinho still not fit enough to start, Nathaniel Clyne out with a rib injury and Joel Matip sidelined because of confusion surrounding his absence from Cameroon's Africa Cup Of Nations squad.\nManager Jurgen Klopp rightly believes they are still in a strong position but will surely be frustrated that Zlatan Ibrahimovic's late goal means Chelsea stretched their advantage to seven points.\nVerdict: Remain title contenders but top four would still be fine achievement.\nForm: Unbeaten in past four.\nUpcoming fixtures: 22 January - Burnley (home), 31 January - Watford (home), 4 February - Chelsea (away).\nArsenal's win at Swansea City could not have been more convincing and they have responded well to successive losses at Everton and Manchester City, when they conceded winning positions and showed the vulnerability that has haunted them for seasons.\nEven at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday they made a slow start, but it is hard to argue with a 4-0 away win.\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants the Gunners to stay in the title shake-up until the closing stages - and they are certainly doing that so far.\nAre they, however, potential Premier League winners? They cannot be ruled out but it is hard to see where they will pick up the points to haul in Chelsea.\nVerdict: In the mix as their manager demands, but will a soft centre let them down?\nForm: Two defeats in past three.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Tottenham (home), 1 February - West Ham (away), 5 February - Swansea (home).\nManager Pep Guardiola effectively wrote off Manchester City's title challenge after they were giving a thorough working over and beaten 4-0 at Everton.\nCity now face a fight to finish in the top four with a side seemingly physically weak, riddled with defensive frailty and a goalkeeper in Claudio Bravo who hardly ever seems to save a shot. Failure to make next season's Champions League would represent a catastrophe in the Spaniard's first season.\nAnd this is Guardiola's responsibility after he shipped out England keeper Joe Hart on loan to Torino. Out of the past 22 shots Bravo has faced, 14 have been goals.\nOnly five teams have a lower haul than City's tally of four clean sheets and they have conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their past seven games.\nThe problems are there for all to see, although Guardiola has so far done little to correct the faults.\nCity have suffered two damaging defeats on Merseyside in recent weeks - and do not look like a side who have the slightest chance of making up a 10-point deficit on Chelsea.\nVerdict: Forget the title.

They cannot be ruled out but it is hard to see where they will pick up the points to haul in Chelsea.\nVerdict: In the mix as their manager demands, but will a soft centre let them down?\nForm: Two defeats in past three.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Tottenham (home), 1 February - West Ham (away), 5 February - Swansea (home).\nManager Pep Guardiola effectively wrote off Manchester City's title challenge after they were giving a thorough working over and beaten 4-0 at Everton.\nCity now face a fight to finish in the top four with a side seemingly physically weak, riddled with defensive frailty and a goalkeeper in Claudio Bravo who hardly ever seems to save a shot. Failure to make next season's Champions League would represent a catastrophe in the Spaniard's first season.\nAnd this is Guardiola's responsibility after he shipped out England keeper Joe Hart on loan to Torino. Out of the past 22 shots Bravo has faced, 14 have been goals.\nOnly five teams have a lower haul than City's tally of four clean sheets and they have conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their past seven games.\nThe problems are there for all to see, although Guardiola has so far done little to correct the faults.\nCity have suffered two damaging defeats on Merseyside in recent weeks - and do not look like a side who have the slightest chance of making up a 10-point deficit on Chelsea.\nVerdict: Forget the title. Manchester City are in a top-four fight now.\nForm: Unbeaten in past 12.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Stoke (away), 1 February - Hull (home), 5 February - Leicester (away).\nManchester United are showing definite signs of improvement under manager Jose Mourinho, but like neighbours City their fight is now for the top four rather than the title.\nThey could have closed to within two points of Liverpool with victory at Old Trafford on Sunday, but 12 points is surely an impossible gap to breach between United and Chelsea.\nUnited have drawn seven league games - including five at home - and the simple fact is they have squandered too many points to make up the deficit.\nMourinho is definitely moving United forward, but not fast enough to make them title contenders this season.\nVerdict: Top four should be the target.

I hit the first one as hard as I really could considering how close the pin was to the edge of the green.\"\nThe world number four went straight to the practice green after taking 35 putts in round one but he said his efforts on Friday, when he took 30, were \"pathetic\".\n\"Putting let me down at [the US Open in June at] Oakmont and then putting let me down here again,\" he said.\n\"My tee to green game - there's not much wrong with that. It's pretty solid. If you had given anyone else in this field my tee shots this week, they would have been up near the top of the leaderboard.\n\"It just shows you how bad I was around the greens.\"\nThe Swede was grouped with the year's other two major winners - Masters champion Danny Willett and US Open victor Dustin Johnson - and he outscored them on both days.\nHe dropped to one under par after three-putt bogeys on the 12th and 13th holes but a three-foot eagle putt on the par-five 18th, his ninth, followed by three birdies on the front nine, moved him one clear of the field.\n\"I got off to a bit of a wobbly start and stood over a six-foot putt on the 14th to avoid going three over, so I'm quite happy that went in and I turned it on from 18,\" said the 40-year-old, who won his first major at Royal Troon two weeks ago.\n\"That could easily have gone the wrong way but I was hanging in there and got the good stuff coming in.\"\nWillett birdied the ninth to card a 70 and make the cut on one over, but pre-tournament favourite Johnson is going home after adding a 72 to his opening 77 for a nine-over total.\nNeither American has never won a major and while Walker has five victories on the PGA Tour, Streb has just one and has missed nine cuts in 23 events in 2016.\nWalker, 37, made a solid start to round two with two birdies and seven pars in his opening nine holes before moving clear of the field with a run of three successive birdies from the 12th.\nHe pulled his tee shot on the 17th into a hospitality area and escaped with a free drop and par five but an almost identical shot on the last was not so lucky, ending up in a lake and resulting in a dropped shot.\n\"The finish wasn't what I was looking for, but it's fine,\" said Walker. \"I think you take 66 at any tournament all day every day. So it's good.\n\"I will watch the leaderboard on Saturday. I don't think that's a big deal. I enjoy watching it.

I hit the first one as hard as I really could considering how close the pin was to the edge of the green.\"\nThe world number four went straight to the practice green after taking 35 putts in round one but he said his efforts on Friday, when he took 30, were \"pathetic\".\n\"Putting let me down at [the US Open in June at] Oakmont and then putting let me down here again,\" he said.\n\"My tee to green game - there's not much wrong with that. It's pretty solid. If you had given anyone else in this field my tee shots this week, they would have been up near the top of the leaderboard.\n\"It just shows you how bad I was around the greens.\"\nThe Swede was grouped with the year's other two major winners - Masters champion Danny Willett and US Open victor Dustin Johnson - and he outscored them on both days.\nHe dropped to one under par after three-putt bogeys on the 12th and 13th holes but a three-foot eagle putt on the par-five 18th, his ninth, followed by three birdies on the front nine, moved him one clear of the field.\n\"I got off to a bit of a wobbly start and stood over a six-foot putt on the 14th to avoid going three over, so I'm quite happy that went in and I turned it on from 18,\" said the 40-year-old, who won his first major at Royal Troon two weeks ago.\n\"That could easily have gone the wrong way but I was hanging in there and got the good stuff coming in.\"\nWillett birdied the ninth to card a 70 and make the cut on one over, but pre-tournament favourite Johnson is going home after adding a 72 to his opening 77 for a nine-over total.\nNeither American has never won a major and while Walker has five victories on the PGA Tour, Streb has just one and has missed nine cuts in 23 events in 2016.\nWalker, 37, made a solid start to round two with two birdies and seven pars in his opening nine holes before moving clear of the field with a run of three successive birdies from the 12th.\nHe pulled his tee shot on the 17th into a hospitality area and escaped with a free drop and par five but an almost identical shot on the last was not so lucky, ending up in a lake and resulting in a dropped shot.\n\"The finish wasn't what I was looking for, but it's fine,\" said Walker. \"I think you take 66 at any tournament all day every day. So it's good.\n\"I will watch the leaderboard on Saturday. I don't think that's a big deal. I enjoy watching it. I think you need to know where you are at.\"\nStreb started on the 10th and had four birdies and a bogey in his opening nine holes and closed with three in four holes to become the 30th player to card a 63 in a major - no player has ever shot a 62.\nThe 29-year-old, who missed the cut at each of the first three majors of 2016, said he turned up this week \"just to see if I could play some good golf and have fun\".\nHe added: \"Obviously it's going pretty well, but my expectations are pretty low, which maybe is a good thing.\"\nDay was Friday's other big mover, knocking in seven birdies in eight holes from the eighth to sit two off the lead.\n\"I kind of gave myself a little bit of a kick up the bum with the double bogey on seven,\" he said.\n\"It was a bit of a mess but to come back and birdie eight and nine made things a lot better for me on the back nine.\"\nFormer world number one and two-time major winner Spieth had five birdies in his opening nine holes to get to four under par but missed several opportunities to better his score on his back nine, while a bogey saw him close on three under.\n\"It was a really solid round and I'm back in contention,\" said the American. \"I'm hitting the ball fantastic.

He dropped back to level with bogeys on the fifth and seventh holes, but he then birdied the eighth.\n\"Every hole, man, I get so many nice comments,\" said the 27-year-old. \"Even after the fifth hole, when I three-putted, they are like, 'Don't worry, Beef, come on, bounce back, you've got this one'.

Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nThousands of commercial vessels from around the world enter UK waters every year, bringing a chance for international criminal gangs to surreptitiously move drugs over water and on to shore.\nIf illegal substances are being smuggled, it is the job of the National Deep Rummage Team (NDRT) to find where.\nBut vessels are vast structures with many hiding places - some are capable of carrying 14,000 containers, equal in length to a 44-mile long train.\nDrugs could be concealed anywhere from under a cabin bed bunk to the harder to reach places like tanks filled with liquid or buried deep within the bulkhead.\nPaul Tunney, the team's senior officer, said: \"It's like a giant game of hide and seek but there's no-one to tell us if we're getting warmer.\n\"You've got to go on board with imagination and with the mindset that you are going to find something.\"\nWorking vessels are hostile environments and with it brings the risk of danger to rummagers.\nThey have to climb in and inspect tanks, crawl into the vessel's inner structure or scale the hull walls of the cargo holds.\nBecause of the specialised nature of their work, they also have to be trained in immediate life support first aid and self rescue, rather than rely on other emergency services.\n\"When we're on a vessel it is working, it is discharging and loading cargo so there are lots of things on the move,\" said Mr Tunney.\n\"If we're going into a confined space it needs to be aerated, there could be gases or a lack of oxygen in it.\n\"If we're going into a tank, we have to check the atmosphere of the tank and go in wearing breathing apparatus.\n\"People have died in accidents on vessels and we don't want that to happen to our officers.\"\nAs crucial as hunting out and searching the confined spaces is, the 'bread and butter' of rummage work is talking to those on board.\n\"We talk to the captain and crew, monitor their body language, see how they feel about us being on board and take all those factors into account,\" said Mr Tunney.\n\"There are clues, it's just recognising them. It may be that the captain says no-one has been in a particular area but you notice footprints or you see some new piece of construction.\n\"Vessels don't smuggle, it's people that smuggle.\"\nThe Border Force's NDRT formed in 2004. There are now four specialist teams based at Liverpool, Immingham, Felixstowe and Southampton.\nSince its launch, the teams have found some 777 kilos of class A drugs with a street value of approximately \u00c2\u00a3155m.\nThe teams are responding to an ever-changing shipping world.\nCrew previously made their fortunes smuggling tea, silk and brandy into UK ports.\nNow highly organised international crime groups are able to bring drugs, cigarettes and illegal immigrants into the UK.\nMr Tunney said: \"Often we find people involved in smuggling are going on diving holidays thinking they can learn to dive and then collect drugs attached to the hull of vessels over here.\n\"Diving in water near ships is totally different to swimming in the Red Sea.\n\"It's an unforgiving environment and people can very quickly get disorientated.\"\nThe team works closely with other maritime authorities, the police dive teams, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and other government departments.\nVessels are selected for searching by an intelligence-driven method, with those presenting the highest risk targeted.\nMuch of the team's success comes down to having access to the MV Altea - a ship that was impounded after being caught attempting to smuggle 17 tonnes of cannabis into the country in 1989.\nIt was agreed by the Treasury to let the rummaging team use it as their training facility and the vessel is now permanently moored in Liverpool Docks.\nMr Tunney said: \"At the end of the day we're stopping illegal goods onto the streets of the UK, we're protecting our families and communities and that's where we get our buzz.\"\n\nSummary 1:\nThe National Deep Rummage Team searches commercial vessels entering UK waters for illegal drugs and other contraband, using specialized training and tactics to find hidden substances in vast and complex cargo ships.\n\nSummary 2:\nSpecialist Border Force officers have given BBC News a rare insight into the high-stakes game of \"hide-and-seek\" they are involved in on a daily basis in the hunt for smuggled drugs aboard ships entering UK ports.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

The pollution swathes the city, wreathing everything in grey.\nTo get a sense of it, take a look at this slideshow of before and after pictures that give a sense of what China's toxic sky is really like.\nA combination of coal emissions, dirty diesel and industrial gases, the smog has smothered everything for days. On Thursday, levels still hovered around the \"very unhealthy\" mark.\nAs the official Xinhua news agency reported, more flights were delayed at Tianjin close to Beijing. Visibility in Shandong province south of Beijing was just 50m (164ft).\nOn Thursday, too, there were reported to be more than 100 cars in crashes in Beijing. The roads were icy and slippery, but poor visibility cannot have helped.\nWhat were billed as \"tough\" measures brought in by Beijing's government this week to try to improve things simply have not been enough.\nOn Tuesday, 103 factories were ordered to shut down, and a third of government cars ordered off the roads to combat what was already being described as the worst January smog since 1954.\nBut even state-controlled media now say Beijing's tough measures were ignored by city officials themselves.\nMore than 800 government vehicles ordered off the roads were still in use, and several construction sites ordered suspended were still active on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.\nSo everyone now is looking at the weather forecast, hoping the smog will be blown away by winds forecast for Friday.\nThat's about the only thing that will bring some respite.\nA bigger question will linger even after the smog has cleared: can China curb its polluting ways for good?\nJanuary's pollution has afflicted not just Beijing and its 20 million people, but more than 30 major cities and many tens of millions of people in addition.\nAs the Communist Party's English-language tabloid the Global Times put it in an editorial on Thursday: \"China's rapid development has brought us many benefits as well as accumulated many problems. Environmental protection should take up a more prominent position in China's future strategy even if it means that China's economic development will slow down.\"\n\"Chinese people,\" the paper said, \"should not tolerate environmental pollution for the pursuit of wealth...

The pollution swathes the city, wreathing everything in grey.\nTo get a sense of it, take a look at this slideshow of before and after pictures that give a sense of what China's toxic sky is really like.\nA combination of coal emissions, dirty diesel and industrial gases, the smog has smothered everything for days. On Thursday, levels still hovered around the \"very unhealthy\" mark.\nAs the official Xinhua news agency reported, more flights were delayed at Tianjin close to Beijing. Visibility in Shandong province south of Beijing was just 50m (164ft).\nOn Thursday, too, there were reported to be more than 100 cars in crashes in Beijing. The roads were icy and slippery, but poor visibility cannot have helped.\nWhat were billed as \"tough\" measures brought in by Beijing's government this week to try to improve things simply have not been enough.\nOn Tuesday, 103 factories were ordered to shut down, and a third of government cars ordered off the roads to combat what was already being described as the worst January smog since 1954.\nBut even state-controlled media now say Beijing's tough measures were ignored by city officials themselves.\nMore than 800 government vehicles ordered off the roads were still in use, and several construction sites ordered suspended were still active on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.\nSo everyone now is looking at the weather forecast, hoping the smog will be blown away by winds forecast for Friday.\nThat's about the only thing that will bring some respite.\nA bigger question will linger even after the smog has cleared: can China curb its polluting ways for good?\nJanuary's pollution has afflicted not just Beijing and its 20 million people, but more than 30 major cities and many tens of millions of people in addition.\nAs the Communist Party's English-language tabloid the Global Times put it in an editorial on Thursday: \"China's rapid development has brought us many benefits as well as accumulated many problems. Environmental protection should take up a more prominent position in China's future strategy even if it means that China's economic development will slow down.\"\n\"Chinese people,\" the paper said, \"should not tolerate environmental pollution for the pursuit of wealth... We cannot keep going with the situation that we have today.\"\nThe difficult bit is how to change the path China is on.\nOn the plus side, then, there is a growing realisation things have to change, and the media are now being allowed to debate the issue.\nChina's government seems to be in agreement.

So I think it's unfair to comment on that,\" he says.\n\"But he's done a great job, got some talented players there at the moment and I think the focus with Wales at the moment will be just winning those next four games and getting to the World Cup.\"\nOK, then, leaving Coleman out of the equation for now, theoretically, would Giggs at least want to manage Wales one day?\n\"I've seen Mark Hughes do it, Cookie [Coleman] do it, Gary Speed do it. It is a good job,\" he adds, still not giving an inch.\n\"And I think, when you are a coach, in my experience United would be a great job and coaching your country. Whether it be soon or in 10 or 15 years' time, we'll just have to wait and see.\"\nAt this point, Giggs bursts into laughter, admitting with a mischievous grin: \"I've not given you an answer there, have I?\"\nYou can understand why Giggs is reluctant to state outright his ambition of managing Wales.\nHe considers Coleman a friend and would not like to be seen to be eyeing his job.\nBesides, if Wales' players and other coaches had their way, Coleman would change his mind and lead them beyond this campaign.\n\"That's totally up to Cookie. What he's done for Welsh football is remarkable,\" says Giggs.\n\"The whole team just captured the imagination at the (2016) Euros and a large part of that is down to him. The team he's built, the character he is, the team spirit.\n\"Teams are very much a shadow of the manager and I think this Welsh team is, knowing Chris as well I do, because he is larger than life, he is a great character, a great person to be around, but also a serious football man.\"\nAs someone who has spent more than half of his life as a professional player or coach, Giggs is also very much a \"serious football man\".\nBut the success and all-consuming nature of his playing career means he is happy to spend some time away from the sport's firing line.\nAnd although a year out may mean a clean break from your profession for most, football has still featured prominently in Giggs' sabbatical-of-sorts.\n\"Life's good. I've just completed my first year without football and it's been good,\" he says.\n\"I've been really busy doing some TV work for the Euros when I finished, then I went to India playing futsal, then a bit more punditry, doing some work for Uefa as a technical observer, which is good keeping me in football, and then just doing the normal dad stuff, watching your son play football, and watching Salford City, who I'm co-owner of. So it's been really busy and really good.\n\"You find out there's a whole big old world out there outside football, so I'm enjoying it.\n\"I think the pressure you put yourself under, be it as a player or a coach, that pressure's sort of come off. It's a strange feeling but it's good.\n\"I'm exactly where I was last summer, more or less got the next six months planned but, with the chance if a club does come in and want to talk, then I can do that.\"\nWhile being football-centric, what the last 12 months have given Giggs is some time away from the pressure cooker of the Premier League and its myriad, relentless demands.\nThat breathing space has allowed the Welshman to contemplate his options, speak to former managers - Sir Alex Ferguson most regularly - and also learn from coaches of other sports.\n\"Rugby is a big love for me because my dad [Danny Wilson] played rugby and I'm a rugby fan, whether it be league or union,\" Giggs says.\n\"I know Rob Howley [former Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half and current assistant coach], I've met Warren Gatland [Wales and Lions head coach], I've spent an evening next to Eddie Jones [England head coach], who was constantly asking me about football - it was brilliant.\n\"I was asking him all about his coaching career, but he was asking me more about football and Sir Alex.\"\nGiggs appears to be refreshed by his time off, chatting excitedly about the previous 12 months and his future managerial career.\nSo does a 'gap year' like this revitalise one's passion for football?\n\"I think it does,\" Giggs says.\n\"It's brilliant I can step out because I was two years as a coach, you're constantly putting yourself under pressure, you're always thinking how you can improve the team, so to step away from it and be a bit more relaxed, you can look at things in a different way.\n\"I think I am ready [to return] but, also, I'm enjoying life and busy doing other stuff. If it happens then great, I'm ready because I've prepared myself as best I could with all my badges and the two years under Louis [van Gaal] at United.\n\"Whether that be in the lower leagues or a foreign club, I don't know.

One of the summaries was written by you, and one was not, and I want you to tell me which one you think you wrote. The prompt given to the summary writer was: \"Provide a one-sentence summary (no more than 30 words) with no other text.\". Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nHe has been enjoying a first year off in a career which has spanned more than a quarter of a century, starting with his United debut in 1990 and coming to a temporary halt when he left the club as a coach 12 months ago.\nGiggs has since been linked with several managerial vacancies - Sunderland and Middlesbrough among the most recent - and he was interviewed for the Swansea City job last October.\nAnd while the Welshman has distanced himself from most speculation, there is one managerial post to which his name always appears to be closely connected: his country.\nChris Coleman has said the current World Cup campaign will be his last in charge of Wales, prompting many to suggest Giggs as his successor.\nBut when he is asked about the subject, Giggs is as fleet of foot as he was on the Old Trafford turf.\n\"With Cookie still in the job, I know what he said, but he could change his mind and carry on. So I think it's unfair to comment on that,\" he says.\n\"But he's done a great job, got some talented players there at the moment and I think the focus with Wales at the moment will be just winning those next four games and getting to the World Cup.\"\nOK, then, leaving Coleman out of the equation for now, theoretically, would Giggs at least want to manage Wales one day?\n\"I've seen Mark Hughes do it, Cookie [Coleman] do it, Gary Speed do it. It is a good job,\" he adds, still not giving an inch.\n\"And I think, when you are a coach, in my experience United would be a great job and coaching your country. Whether it be soon or in 10 or 15 years' time, we'll just have to wait and see.\"\nAt this point, Giggs bursts into laughter, admitting with a mischievous grin: \"I've not given you an answer there, have I?\"\nYou can understand why Giggs is reluctant to state outright his ambition of managing Wales.\nHe considers Coleman a friend and would not like to be seen to be eyeing his job.\nBesides, if Wales' players and other coaches had their way, Coleman would change his mind and lead them beyond this campaign.\n\"That's totally up to Cookie. What he's done for Welsh football is remarkable,\" says Giggs.\n\"The whole team just captured the imagination at the (2016) Euros and a large part of that is down to him. The team he's built, the character he is, the team spirit.\n\"Teams are very much a shadow of the manager and I think this Welsh team is, knowing Chris as well I do, because he is larger than life, he is a great character, a great person to be around, but also a serious football man.\"\nAs someone who has spent more than half of his life as a professional player or coach, Giggs is also very much a \"serious football man\".\nBut the success and all-consuming nature of his playing career means he is happy to spend some time away from the sport's firing line.\nAnd although a year out may mean a clean break from your profession for most, football has still featured prominently in Giggs' sabbatical-of-sorts.\n\"Life's good. I've just completed my first year without football and it's been good,\" he says.\n\"I've been really busy doing some TV work for the Euros when I finished, then I went to India playing futsal, then a bit more punditry, doing some work for Uefa as a technical observer, which is good keeping me in football, and then just doing the normal dad stuff, watching your son play football, and watching Salford City, who I'm co-owner of. So it's been really busy and really good.\n\"You find out there's a whole big old world out there outside football, so I'm enjoying it.\n\"I think the pressure you put yourself under, be it as a player or a coach, that pressure's sort of come off. It's a strange feeling but it's good.\n\"I'm exactly where I was last summer, more or less got the next six months planned but, with the chance if a club does come in and want to talk, then I can do that.\"\nWhile being football-centric, what the last 12 months have given Giggs is some time away from the pressure cooker of the Premier League and its myriad, relentless demands.\nThat breathing space has allowed the Welshman to contemplate his options, speak to former managers - Sir Alex Ferguson most regularly - and also learn from coaches of other sports.\n\"Rugby is a big love for me because my dad [Danny Wilson] played rugby and I'm a rugby fan, whether it be league or union,\" Giggs says.\n\"I know Rob Howley [former Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half and current assistant coach], I've met Warren Gatland [Wales and Lions head coach], I've spent an evening next to Eddie Jones [England head coach], who was constantly asking me about football - it was brilliant.\n\"I was asking him all about his coaching career, but he was asking me more about football and Sir Alex.\"\nGiggs appears to be refreshed by his time off, chatting excitedly about the previous 12 months and his future managerial career.\nSo does a 'gap year' like this revitalise one's passion for football?\n\"I think it does,\" Giggs says.\n\"It's brilliant I can step out because I was two years as a coach, you're constantly putting yourself under pressure, you're always thinking how you can improve the team, so to step away from it and be a bit more relaxed, you can look at things in a different way.\n\"I think I am ready [to return] but, also, I'm enjoying life and busy doing other stuff. If it happens then great, I'm ready because I've prepared myself as best I could with all my badges and the two years under Louis [van Gaal] at United.\n\"Whether that be in the lower leagues or a foreign club, I don't know. I honestly don't know and that's exciting for me because I've enjoyed this last year. But at some stage, I'm sure I will be back in football, coaching or managing.\"\n\nSummary 1:\nRyan Giggs, former Manchester United player and coach, is enjoying his year off from football, but hasn't ruled out managing Wales or returning to the sport in the future.\n\nSummary 2:\nA little over a decade has passed since Ryan Giggs' final game for Wales yet, even at 43 years old, the former Manchester United winger can still be devilishly elusive.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

In conversations late last year, he was still exultant at his own role in triggering the invasion which unseated Saddam Hussein.

In conversations late last year, he was still exultant at his own role in triggering the invasion which unseated Saddam Hussein. For him, that was the overarching goal that justified any possible means.\nBut it was not just the removal of the dictator that plunged Iraq into the chaos which has continued to shake and fragment the country ever since.\nIn the months that followed, every political and security structure holding the country together was dismantled, including the all-pervasive Baath Party (a process in which Ahmed Chalabi played a role), the army and the intelligence services.\nThousands of highly experienced officers and officials from Saddam Hussein's minority Sunni community were sent home with a burning grudge, setting the scene for the subsequent Sunni-based insurgency, sectarian fragmentation and blood-letting, and the eventual emergence of IS.\nIS began in Iraq and later spread to Syria, where it could exploit the chaos and vacuums caused by the civil war to entrench and grow, eventually erupting back into Iraq with the storming of Mosul last year.\nNow it is firmly entrenched in both countries, and the prospects for pulling both of them back together as unitary states are daunting, given the degree of fragmentation in both.\nThat is the spectre haunting the West, as it ponders how to deal with a crisis that has sent millions of refugees into neighbouring countries, and hundreds of thousands flooding into Europe.\nDoing nothing may increasingly not be an option.

One of the summaries was written by you, and one was not, and I want you to tell me which one you think you wrote. The prompt given to the summary writer was: \"Provide a one-sentence summary (no more than 30 words) with no other text.\". Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nYou might argue about the order in which they should be placed, but few fans - aside from some Barcelona or Real Madrid followers who are unwilling to praise their greatest enemy's biggest star - would question the suggestion that those two are head and shoulders above everybody else.\nThat impression is supported by the result of the annual Ballon d'Or award, which has been presented to Messi in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and to Ronaldo in 2008, 2013 and 2014, with nobody else claiming the prize since Kaka in 2007.\nNow, however, perhaps it is time to reconsider the old notion that nobody else comes close to touching Messi and Ronaldo, because another flamboyant talent is also performing at similarly outrageous levels: Neymar.\nAnd this weekend he could have no bigger stage to prove it, as Barcelona travel to Real Madrid for the first Clasico of the season.\nLate on in Barcelona's home game with Villarreal this month, with the hosts leading 2-0 through goals from Neymar and Luis Suarez, a familiar chant echoed around the Nou Camp as fans reminded an injured hero that he had not been forgotten: \"Meeessi, Meeessi, Meeessi\u2026\"\nWhile they sang, Barca surged forward and Luis Suarez advanced down the left before curling a bouncing cross towards Neymar on the edge of the penalty area.\nWhat Neymar did next will never be forgotten by those fortunate enough to witness it, with the Brazilian forward conjuring a piece of magic which his national team coach Dunga later described as \"the sort of thing that makes football the beautiful game\".\nWith his back to goal, Neymar controlled the cross with his stomach, then immediately flicked it over his head to lose his marker and swivelled 180 degrees to meet the dropping ball with a fierce low volley which flew into the back of the net.\nThe goal was met with astonishment as much as jubilation, and more than 70,000 fans rose to their feet to acclaim the scorer by quickly adapting their previous chant: \"Neeeymar, Neeeymar, Neeeymar.\"\nSame song, different name and, although he obviously did not mean it in this way, the goal felt like a symbolic moment with Neymar delivering an emphatic message to the watching world: 'Forget Messi. I'm king now.'\nThat goal against Villarreal was Neymar's 11th of the season in La Liga, making him the league's top scorer - three ahead of Ronaldo despite playing 93 fewer minutes.\nNot insignificantly, he has been in a particularly rich vein of form during Messi's spell on the sidelines, rising to the challenge of compensating for his fellow South American's absence by scoring 10 goals in his past seven club games.\nAlthough this season's achievements have been particularly impressive, nobody should be too surprised to see Neymar making such a big impact because he has been scoring goals for fun ever since breaking into the Santos first team at the age of 17.\nHe is still only 23, yet Neymar has 249 career goals: 136 for Santos, 67 for Barcelona and 46 for Brazil.\nTo put those figures into context, by the time Messi and Ronaldo reached the age Neymar is now (23 years and nine months), they had 'only' registered respective career goal tallies of 186 and 127.\nEach case is different, with Ronaldo needing some time to develop into the awesome physical specimen he is today, while Messi's younger years were spent in a Barcelona team containing other established stars who commanded more than their fair share of attention.\nFurthermore, you could argue that a chunk of Neymar's early goals came 'cheaply' as they were scored in the relatively low standard Brazilian state championship.\nWhile it does not necessarily follow that Neymar will end up scoring more goals than Messi and Ronaldo simply because he has scored more than them by his current age, surely it suggests that this young man from Sao Paulo should be taken seriously as a potential all-time great?\nNeymar's electrifying performances over the past few weeks have attracted considerable attention in Spain and Albert Masnou, the deputy editor of Barcelona-based newspaper Sport, believes he is playing better than Ronaldo.\n\"At the moment he is surpassing Ronaldo,\" Masnou told BBC Sport. \"Cristiano is enduring a 'grey' period, uncomfortable with his club and his coach. He isn't leading his team or serving as their reference point, although that could easily change in just one game.\n\"But Neymar has become more integral to Barca. He is more consistent and growing a lot as the years go by. Now he is capable of leading the team when Messi's not there, and we are seeing his full potential.\"\nThose views were echoed by a man who knows Neymar extremely well: Tata Martino, who was his coach at Barcelona when he arrived from Santos in the summer of 2013 and who is now in charge of Argentina.\nBefore last week's World Cup qualifier between the two nations, Martino commented: \"Neymar has reached a point of maturity. What he's doing now puts him on a level with the two footballers we consider above the rest.\"\nRonaldinho, who remains a revered figure among Barcelona fans, was also glowing in his tribute of his countryman as he enthused: \"Neymar is a phenomenon. It's nice to see a Brazilian continuing to make history and I think he can be the greatest in the world.\"\nIt will soon get much harder for Neymar to maintain his recent standards, however, because Messi's absence through injury is nearly over. And when that happens, the focus of the Barca team and everyone else - fans, media and opponents - will immediately return to the Argentine.\nMessi is, quite simply, the man around whom the Catalans have built their team, and when he is on the pitch the primary function of the other 10 players is to service him.\nMessi's status is illustrated off the pitch by the parrot-like phrase trotted out weekly by every Barca player that he is \"the best player in the world\", and manager Luis Enrique notably brushed aside a question after the Villarreal game asking whether Neymar is the second best, instead blandly asserting that he is proud to coach lots of great players.\nConsidering Messi's consistent greatness, the reliance upon him is understandable. But it does mean the other players are forced to somewhat subdue their natural games in order to meet the demands of contributing to a team built around Messi.\nSome, such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Alexis Sanchez, have been forced to leave in order to allow their personal talents to flourish. Others - and there is perhaps no better example than Neymar - have accepted that role and made the most out of playing for Messi first, the team second and themselves third.\nMasnou says Neymar will, in the short term, have no problem stepping out of the spotlight once Messi returns.\n\"He didn't join Barca to overshadow Messi, but to be his heir,\" Masnou said. \"Neymar has been the king for two months but he knows that when Messi is there, the leader is Messi.\"\nNeymar is widely regarded in Barcelona as the heir apparent: the player lined up to become the team's focal point when Messi has retired or entered into decline.\nThe question, however, is how much longer Neymar will be prepared to accept that role. Messi is only 28 and could still be performing at or near his peak for another four or five years.\nBy then, Neymar will be in his late 20s and may well have grown tired of being the chief member of the supporting cast rather than taking the lead role.\nPerhaps the key for Barca will be to create a slightly more level playing field, one which places just as much importance in Neymar as it does in Messi: to use Masnou's poetic phrase, a system which makes them \"equal protagonists\".\nThe past few weeks have suggested that Neymar is good enough to merit a more elevated standing, placing him shoulder to shoulder with Messi rather than deferentially looking up to him.\nWhether Messi will be prepared to share his crown is another matter.\n\nSummary 1:\nNeymar's impressive goal-scoring form has led to suggestions that he may be on par with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, challenging the notion that he is the third-best player in the world.\n\nSummary 2:\nFor the past few years, there has been a general consensus of opinion among football supporters that Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are the best players in the world.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

One of the summaries was written by you, and one was not, and I want you to tell me which one you think you wrote. The prompt given to the summary writer was: \"Provide a one-sentence summary (no more than 30 words) with no other text.\". Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nYou might argue about the order in which they should be placed, but few fans - aside from some Barcelona or Real Madrid followers who are unwilling to praise their greatest enemy's biggest star - would question the suggestion that those two are head and shoulders above everybody else.\nThat impression is supported by the result of the annual Ballon d'Or award, which has been presented to Messi in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and to Ronaldo in 2008, 2013 and 2014, with nobody else claiming the prize since Kaka in 2007.\nNow, however, perhaps it is time to reconsider the old notion that nobody else comes close to touching Messi and Ronaldo, because another flamboyant talent is also performing at similarly outrageous levels: Neymar.\nAnd this weekend he could have no bigger stage to prove it, as Barcelona travel to Real Madrid for the first Clasico of the season.\nLate on in Barcelona's home game with Villarreal this month, with the hosts leading 2-0 through goals from Neymar and Luis Suarez, a familiar chant echoed around the Nou Camp as fans reminded an injured hero that he had not been forgotten: \"Meeessi, Meeessi, Meeessi\u2026\"\nWhile they sang, Barca surged forward and Luis Suarez advanced down the left before curling a bouncing cross towards Neymar on the edge of the penalty area.\nWhat Neymar did next will never be forgotten by those fortunate enough to witness it, with the Brazilian forward conjuring a piece of magic which his national team coach Dunga later described as \"the sort of thing that makes football the beautiful game\".\nWith his back to goal, Neymar controlled the cross with his stomach, then immediately flicked it over his head to lose his marker and swivelled 180 degrees to meet the dropping ball with a fierce low volley which flew into the back of the net.\nThe goal was met with astonishment as much as jubilation, and more than 70,000 fans rose to their feet to acclaim the scorer by quickly adapting their previous chant: \"Neeeymar, Neeeymar, Neeeymar.\"\nSame song, different name and, although he obviously did not mean it in this way, the goal felt like a symbolic moment with Neymar delivering an emphatic message to the watching world: 'Forget Messi. I'm king now.'\nThat goal against Villarreal was Neymar's 11th of the season in La Liga, making him the league's top scorer - three ahead of Ronaldo despite playing 93 fewer minutes.\nNot insignificantly, he has been in a particularly rich vein of form during Messi's spell on the sidelines, rising to the challenge of compensating for his fellow South American's absence by scoring 10 goals in his past seven club games.\nAlthough this season's achievements have been particularly impressive, nobody should be too surprised to see Neymar making such a big impact because he has been scoring goals for fun ever since breaking into the Santos first team at the age of 17.\nHe is still only 23, yet Neymar has 249 career goals: 136 for Santos, 67 for Barcelona and 46 for Brazil.\nTo put those figures into context, by the time Messi and Ronaldo reached the age Neymar is now (23 years and nine months), they had 'only' registered respective career goal tallies of 186 and 127.\nEach case is different, with Ronaldo needing some time to develop into the awesome physical specimen he is today, while Messi's younger years were spent in a Barcelona team containing other established stars who commanded more than their fair share of attention.\nFurthermore, you could argue that a chunk of Neymar's early goals came 'cheaply' as they were scored in the relatively low standard Brazilian state championship.\nWhile it does not necessarily follow that Neymar will end up scoring more goals than Messi and Ronaldo simply because he has scored more than them by his current age, surely it suggests that this young man from Sao Paulo should be taken seriously as a potential all-time great?\nNeymar's electrifying performances over the past few weeks have attracted considerable attention in Spain and Albert Masnou, the deputy editor of Barcelona-based newspaper Sport, believes he is playing better than Ronaldo.\n\"At the moment he is surpassing Ronaldo,\" Masnou told BBC Sport. \"Cristiano is enduring a 'grey' period, uncomfortable with his club and his coach. He isn't leading his team or serving as their reference point, although that could easily change in just one game.\n\"But Neymar has become more integral to Barca. He is more consistent and growing a lot as the years go by. Now he is capable of leading the team when Messi's not there, and we are seeing his full potential.\"\nThose views were echoed by a man who knows Neymar extremely well: Tata Martino, who was his coach at Barcelona when he arrived from Santos in the summer of 2013 and who is now in charge of Argentina.\nBefore last week's World Cup qualifier between the two nations, Martino commented: \"Neymar has reached a point of maturity. What he's doing now puts him on a level with the two footballers we consider above the rest.\"\nRonaldinho, who remains a revered figure among Barcelona fans, was also glowing in his tribute of his countryman as he enthused: \"Neymar is a phenomenon. It's nice to see a Brazilian continuing to make history and I think he can be the greatest in the world.\"\nIt will soon get much harder for Neymar to maintain his recent standards, however, because Messi's absence through injury is nearly over. And when that happens, the focus of the Barca team and everyone else - fans, media and opponents - will immediately return to the Argentine.\nMessi is, quite simply, the man around whom the Catalans have built their team, and when he is on the pitch the primary function of the other 10 players is to service him.\nMessi's status is illustrated off the pitch by the parrot-like phrase trotted out weekly by every Barca player that he is \"the best player in the world\", and manager Luis Enrique notably brushed aside a question after the Villarreal game asking whether Neymar is the second best, instead blandly asserting that he is proud to coach lots of great players.\nConsidering Messi's consistent greatness, the reliance upon him is understandable. But it does mean the other players are forced to somewhat subdue their natural games in order to meet the demands of contributing to a team built around Messi.\nSome, such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Alexis Sanchez, have been forced to leave in order to allow their personal talents to flourish. Others - and there is perhaps no better example than Neymar - have accepted that role and made the most out of playing for Messi first, the team second and themselves third.\nMasnou says Neymar will, in the short term, have no problem stepping out of the spotlight once Messi returns.\n\"He didn't join Barca to overshadow Messi, but to be his heir,\" Masnou said. \"Neymar has been the king for two months but he knows that when Messi is there, the leader is Messi.\"\nNeymar is widely regarded in Barcelona as the heir apparent: the player lined up to become the team's focal point when Messi has retired or entered into decline.\nThe question, however, is how much longer Neymar will be prepared to accept that role. Messi is only 28 and could still be performing at or near his peak for another four or five years.\nBy then, Neymar will be in his late 20s and may well have grown tired of being the chief member of the supporting cast rather than taking the lead role.\nPerhaps the key for Barca will be to create a slightly more level playing field, one which places just as much importance in Neymar as it does in Messi: to use Masnou's poetic phrase, a system which makes them \"equal protagonists\".\nThe past few weeks have suggested that Neymar is good enough to merit a more elevated standing, placing him shoulder to shoulder with Messi rather than deferentially looking up to him.\nWhether Messi will be prepared to share his crown is another matter.\n\nSummary 1:\nNeymar's impressive goal-scoring form has led to suggestions that he may be on par with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, challenging the notion that he is the third-best player in the world.\n\nSummary 2:\nFor the past few years, there has been a general consensus of opinion among football supporters that Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are the best players in the world.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

We need urgent action now to prevent thousands of cancers in the future.\"\nFood Standards Scotland said it supported the charity's call for action but it cautioned that there was no \"single silver bullet\" to Scotland's obesity problem.\nIts head of nutrition science and policy, Heather Peace, said: \"We all need to recognise there is a problem and everyone, including consumers, the food and drink industry, retailers, media and government has a part to play in finding a solution.\"\nPublic Health Minister Aileen Campbell said: \"We are committed to tackling Scotland's obesity problems and will consult on our new diet and obesity strategy this year, building on our wide range of activity to make it easier for people to be more active, eat less and eat better.\n\"We're investing \u00c2\u00a312m over five years to 2017 on a range of programmes to specifically tackle the nation's poor diet, including engaging with the food and drink industry on action to offer healthier choices, rebalance promotions, and reformulate products with a focus on reducing calories, salt, fats and added sugar.\"\n\nSummary 1:\nA new study by Cancer Research UK found that nearly 40% of Scots consume confectionery daily, linking it to the single biggest cause of preventable cancer after smoking.\n\nSummary 2:\nScotland has been warned it is hurtling towards an \"epidemic of larger waistlines and increased cancer risk\" fuelled by people's love of sweet treats and fast food.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

I was heard last week by the Swiss Authorities only as a person providing information and I cooperated fully.\"\nBut this was contradicted by the Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber, who said: \"We didn't interview Mr Platini as a witness, that's not true.

But there has been other times, like today, when a couple of chances came. In the early part of the season he was getting them and finishing them.\"\nMoyes was given the Sunderland job after Sam Allardyce  left for his brief stint as England manager.\nHe has not been helped by injuries, with Jan Kirchhoff, Lee Cattermole, Duncan Watmore, Jordan Pickford, Paddy McNair and Victor Anichebe among the first-team players to have had lengthy spells on the sidelines.\nShort said: \"I acknowledge that during my ownership mistakes have been made, particularly in the area of player recruitment, and as a result we have found ourselves struggling to survive in recent seasons.\n\"We had massive disruption during the summer transfer window, and an unprecedented number of injuries throughout the season.\n\"These are difficulties which we have been unable to overcome and we are paying the price for that now.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMatch of the Day pundit and former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer:\nDavid Moyes has got to take responsibility as has the owner. It's been a disastrous season from start to finish. Mismanagement at all levels and they've signed some poor players. They've been flirting with relegations for a number of seasons and it was inevitable it was going to happen.\nA \u00a328m net spend in the last three transfer windows is comparable with teams in and around them, but I worry for Sunderland. There are two players that are assets in that team [Jordan Pickford and Jermain Defoe]. Other than that there's not too much in that squad that's worth a lot of money.\nMatch of the Day commentator John Motson:\nA club badly managed from above for the last four years.

Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nAnd, on a drive between the Republican Convention in Cleveland, Ohio and the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia, I gained an insight into another factor adding to the unpredictability - the growing numbers of Americans who are switching, or thinking of switching, party allegiances. In some cases, they are changing the voting habits of a lifetime.\nThe first switcher was just a few blocks from the Republican convention location. Tim - who didn't want to give his last name - is a lawyer who works in Cleveland's Key Tower, the tallest building between Chicago and Philadelphia. A lifelong Republican, he believes that Mr Trump is not just telling tall stories, but dangerous ones.\n\"I am very concerned about any leader who appeals to the worst instincts of human nature. That's very dangerous for the country and I love my country more than I love my party.\"\nSo will he vote for Hillary Clinton? \"I may. I haven't quite got there, but I definitely won't vote for Donald Trump. Anyone who knows me knows how ridiculous that sounds, that I would even think of voting for her.\"\nI heard a very different view in the run-down town of Warren, 50 miles east of Cleveland. At the 422 restaurant, the only place to eat on what local people say was once a bustling strip, I met a group of disillusioned Democrats. They used to work at the town's steel mill, which is now nothing more than a fenced-off patch of wasteland.\nAs jobs, opportunities and hopes have disappeared, so too has the loyalty they felt - or were encouraged to feel by the unions - towards the Democratic Party. During the 35 years that Joe Shrodek worked in the mill's blast furnace, he always voted for Democratic presidential candidates. But not this time.\n\"When I was there I voted Democrat the whole time, the unions endorsed [the candidate]. All that's gone now. I just want change, that's all. They need to clean house in Washington.\"\nSo, is Mr Trump the man to do that?\n\"I don't know,\" he says, \"but I'm voting for him.\"\nWatching Joe and his friends mop up the restaurant's roasted hot pepper dip with slices of white bread, local Republican Party chairman Randy Law predicts that Mr Trump will soak up the votes of many other white working class voters like them.\n\"I see it every day. People calling me, emailing me. There is this anti-Hillary feeling. People seeing it as a third term for Obama. People are fed up with a lot of those policies that have hurt big business, small business and trade and people are tired of being politically correct.\"\nCrossing the state line into Pennsylvania, another swing state, where polls suggest a tight contest, I encountered a different type of switcher. Judie Radel, who owns the Yee Haw farm in Duncannon, has always voted Democrat. She was a Bernie Sanders supporter in the primaries. Patting her \"girls\" - the milk cows she tends on the 160 acres she farms - she says that she's leaning Republican.\n\"I don't trust Hillary. We've had eight years of a Hillary administration and I think we need change.\"\nShe says that she enjoyed Mr Trump's speech at the Republican convention. \"I like that it was a doom and gloom speech that didn't sugar coat what's going down in our country. Our country's in dire straits right now. We need to wake up.\"\nShe expresses some misgivings about a Trump finger on the nuclear button, but doesn't think it disqualifies him from the White House.\nAn hour south-east of Yee Haw farm, in Pennsylvania's more affluent Lancaster County, Ann Womble is rather more concerned. She has been an active Republican Party member for 30 years and was a delegate to the 2012 convention in Tampa.\nBut the Trump takeover has led her to take a big decision - she's just cancelled her party membership. She dismisses comparisons between the reality TV star, Donald Trump, and the Hollywood actor, Ronald Reagan, who first attracted her to the party.\n\"Reagan's candidacy was a sunny, happy conservative insurgency into the Republican Party, because it was optimistic. Now, we're in the opposite place. Trump is attracting people to his candidacy for dark, gloomy and dangerous reasons.\n\"His view is of an autocratic, almost Third World leader. If he were actually president of the United States and tweeting these things that he tweets all hours of the day, saying these things to camera, it could be apocalyptic.\"\nBut, despite that assessment, Ann can't bring herself to vote for the Republican Party's bogeywoman, Mrs Clinton, in November. Although she'll support Republican candidates for Congress, she may not vote in the presidential election at all.\nAnd that represents one of the challenges for the Democratic Party.\nWhile disillusioned Democrats are embracing Mr Trump, disillusioned Republicans find it much harder to support his opponent.

One of the summaries was written by you, and one was not, and I want you to tell me which one you think you wrote. The prompt given to the summary writer was: \"Provide a one-sentence summary (no more than 30 words) with no other text.\". Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nAnd, on a drive between the Republican Convention in Cleveland, Ohio and the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia, I gained an insight into another factor adding to the unpredictability - the growing numbers of Americans who are switching, or thinking of switching, party allegiances. In some cases, they are changing the voting habits of a lifetime.\nThe first switcher was just a few blocks from the Republican convention location. Tim - who didn't want to give his last name - is a lawyer who works in Cleveland's Key Tower, the tallest building between Chicago and Philadelphia. A lifelong Republican, he believes that Mr Trump is not just telling tall stories, but dangerous ones.\n\"I am very concerned about any leader who appeals to the worst instincts of human nature. That's very dangerous for the country and I love my country more than I love my party.\"\nSo will he vote for Hillary Clinton? \"I may. I haven't quite got there, but I definitely won't vote for Donald Trump. Anyone who knows me knows how ridiculous that sounds, that I would even think of voting for her.\"\nI heard a very different view in the run-down town of Warren, 50 miles east of Cleveland. At the 422 restaurant, the only place to eat on what local people say was once a bustling strip, I met a group of disillusioned Democrats. They used to work at the town's steel mill, which is now nothing more than a fenced-off patch of wasteland.\nAs jobs, opportunities and hopes have disappeared, so too has the loyalty they felt - or were encouraged to feel by the unions - towards the Democratic Party. During the 35 years that Joe Shrodek worked in the mill's blast furnace, he always voted for Democratic presidential candidates. But not this time.\n\"When I was there I voted Democrat the whole time, the unions endorsed [the candidate]. All that's gone now. I just want change, that's all. They need to clean house in Washington.\"\nSo, is Mr Trump the man to do that?\n\"I don't know,\" he says, \"but I'm voting for him.\"\nWatching Joe and his friends mop up the restaurant's roasted hot pepper dip with slices of white bread, local Republican Party chairman Randy Law predicts that Mr Trump will soak up the votes of many other white working class voters like them.\n\"I see it every day. People calling me, emailing me. There is this anti-Hillary feeling. People seeing it as a third term for Obama. People are fed up with a lot of those policies that have hurt big business, small business and trade and people are tired of being politically correct.\"\nCrossing the state line into Pennsylvania, another swing state, where polls suggest a tight contest, I encountered a different type of switcher. Judie Radel, who owns the Yee Haw farm in Duncannon, has always voted Democrat. She was a Bernie Sanders supporter in the primaries. Patting her \"girls\" - the milk cows she tends on the 160 acres she farms - she says that she's leaning Republican.\n\"I don't trust Hillary. We've had eight years of a Hillary administration and I think we need change.\"\nShe says that she enjoyed Mr Trump's speech at the Republican convention. \"I like that it was a doom and gloom speech that didn't sugar coat what's going down in our country. Our country's in dire straits right now. We need to wake up.\"\nShe expresses some misgivings about a Trump finger on the nuclear button, but doesn't think it disqualifies him from the White House.\nAn hour south-east of Yee Haw farm, in Pennsylvania's more affluent Lancaster County, Ann Womble is rather more concerned. She has been an active Republican Party member for 30 years and was a delegate to the 2012 convention in Tampa.\nBut the Trump takeover has led her to take a big decision - she's just cancelled her party membership. She dismisses comparisons between the reality TV star, Donald Trump, and the Hollywood actor, Ronald Reagan, who first attracted her to the party.\n\"Reagan's candidacy was a sunny, happy conservative insurgency into the Republican Party, because it was optimistic. Now, we're in the opposite place. Trump is attracting people to his candidacy for dark, gloomy and dangerous reasons.\n\"His view is of an autocratic, almost Third World leader. If he were actually president of the United States and tweeting these things that he tweets all hours of the day, saying these things to camera, it could be apocalyptic.\"\nBut, despite that assessment, Ann can't bring herself to vote for the Republican Party's bogeywoman, Mrs Clinton, in November. Although she'll support Republican candidates for Congress, she may not vote in the presidential election at all.\nAnd that represents one of the challenges for the Democratic Party.\nWhile disillusioned Democrats are embracing Mr Trump, disillusioned Republicans find it much harder to support his opponent. Mrs Clinton's convention may project a positive vision of America. But to really succeed it needs to address and counter the negative impression that many Americans have of her.\n\nSummary 1:\nAs the US presidential election approaches, many Americans are switching party allegiances, with some lifelong Republicans and Democrats defecting to the opposing party due to dissatisfaction with their own party's candidates.\n\nSummary 2:\nDonald Trump's nomination as the US Republican Party's presidential candidate has been a huge shock to the American political establishment, confounding the forecasts and questioning the models for predicting the outcome of November's election.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

How many students are going to university? And what happens next for those still with big decisions to make?\nMAKING THE GRADE\nA new top grade, A*, was introduced in 2010. A total of 6.6% achieved this in 2016, a fall on last year and still short of the UK average of 8.1%.\nThe proportion of students getting A* and A also fell again from 23.1% to 22.7% and Wales continues to trail the rest of the UK and all regions of England apart from the North East of England.\nWhen you look at individual subjects, more students in Wales have been getting top grades in maths over the last five years than in England - but in English language, Wales has been trailing, with the gap still 3.2% in the latest set of results.\nIn French, 31% got A* to A in Wales - this is an improvement, but 37.8% managed that in England. The gap was as wide as 14% in 2012. Numbers of students taking French have also gone down by 11% this year.\nWales and England are a little further apart now at the top grades for A-level physics, with Wales dropping back to 25.8% behind England on 29.6%.\nIt is worth looking too at how many students are only getting the lower grades.\nA slightly higher proportion in Wales - 23.5% - got D and E grades, compared to 20.6% in England. That gap has also widened slightly too.\nWales has more students getting these lower grades in English (23.2%) than who managed A* to A (15.9%) in the same subject.\nThere is also a more students getting D and E grades in French in Wales than in England for most of the last six years.\nDavid Evans, secretary of NUT Wales, said A-levels were the first time students specialised in subjects and it was important the quality of education and teaching was there.\n\"We need to look at the numbers who get  A* and celebrate them, and those who get As, Bs and Cs too,\" he said.\n\"We need to make sure we have a clear focus on those who achieve the grades they need for university and makes sure support is there for those who go on to do other things as well.\"\nOn the question of whether A-levels are getting easier, Phil McTague, head teacher of Ysgol Eirias in Colwyn Bay said: \"If Usain Bolt sets a new record in the hundred metres, people don't say the hundred metres is getting easier!  Our students have worked really hard this year and we're proud of all their results.\"\nHOW DOES WALES COMPARE WITH ENGLISH REGIONS?\nFor the first time last year, we were able to compare Wales' results with regions of England on the day they were published.\nWales has the lowest percentage of A*-C grades of any area - 73.8- including every English region.\nIt also has the lowest for A* and A - apart from the North East of England, which is now lower than Wales.\nWHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS?\nGirls continue to outperform boys overall in Wales, with 97.9% of entries by girls this year gaining A* to E grades, compared to 96.5% of boys.\nAt the A* grade, the performance of boys was marginally better than that of girls, with 6.7% of boys and 6.5% of girls gaining A* - both improving since 2013.\nYou can also see performance differences between boys and girls for the top grades within subjects - as well as a difference in subjects chosen. The likes of physics and computing are very male dominated compared to French, English and Welsh at the other end of the scale.\nGareth Pierce, chief executive of the WJEC exam board, said some of the patterns were long standing \"and a natural feature\".\nWhy do more girls go to university?\nHOW MANY STUDENTS APPLY FROM WALES?\nThere were 23,740 students from Wales applying to universities in the UK this year - and with many looking at more than one university, this meant a total of 40,010 applications to Ucas.\nThere is very little difference in the number of students from Wales applying to university over the last few years.\nMore than half a million students got higher education places in the UK last year - three quarters of those who applied. These included 20,500 students from Wales, a 1.7% rise and a new high, while 87.5% of 18-year-olds from Wales who applied got places.\nOf those 18-year-old students who applied to Welsh universities, 84% got an offer, while 75% of Welsh applicants to English universities got an offer.\nAlthough there is a lot of attention at schools on results day - only around half of those entering university are 18-year-olds; others take gap years while the number of students over 26 is rising again.\nBy the end of Thursday, Ucas said 17,510 students from Wales had places in higher education - more than at the same time over the last five years.\nSTILL, MORE 18-YEAR-OLDS ARE GOING TO UNIVERSITY\nWales recorded its highest entry rate - 28.2% of all 18-year-olds got higher education places through Ucas in 2015 - although that is behind England on 31.3%.\nWales has had one of the lowest proportional increases of UK nations and regions since 2006 - 13%.\nWHERE YOU LIVE CAN BE A FACTOR\nFewer pupils from poorer parts of Wales get to university.\nEntry rates are broken down across the UK into constituencies and analysis shows they are lower in more disadvantaged areas.\nIn Wales, the entry rate range is from just under 18% of 18-year-olds in Aberavon, to just over 48% in Cardiff North.\nFor those in the most disadvantaged districts in Wales the average rate is 16.6%, almost the same as the year before.\nBut compared with entry rates five years ago, 18-year-olds from disadvantaged areas in Wales were 23% more likely to be accepted for entry in 2015 - in England they were 30% more likely.\nMeanwhile, students living in what are classed as the most advantaged areas of Wales are five-and-a-half times more likely to go to a university with higher entry requirements than those from the most disadvantaged parts.\nLeading academic Prof Sir Deian Hopkin said the numbers from poorer backgrounds getting to university were still disappointing despite efforts.\n\"One of the great challenges in higher education is to attract students from less-affluent backgrounds because. very often, they come from an education system which doesn't encourage them to come to university in the first place,\" he said.\n\"Now a lot has been done over the years, there has been a big improvement, but the proportion has not grown at the same rate as the total increase in students in higher education.

How many students are going to university? And what happens next for those still with big decisions to make?\nMAKING THE GRADE\nA new top grade, A*, was introduced in 2010. A total of 6.6% achieved this in 2016, a fall on last year and still short of the UK average of 8.1%.\nThe proportion of students getting A* and A also fell again from 23.1% to 22.7% and Wales continues to trail the rest of the UK and all regions of England apart from the North East of England.\nWhen you look at individual subjects, more students in Wales have been getting top grades in maths over the last five years than in England - but in English language, Wales has been trailing, with the gap still 3.2% in the latest set of results.\nIn French, 31% got A* to A in Wales - this is an improvement, but 37.8% managed that in England. The gap was as wide as 14% in 2012. Numbers of students taking French have also gone down by 11% this year.\nWales and England are a little further apart now at the top grades for A-level physics, with Wales dropping back to 25.8% behind England on 29.6%.\nIt is worth looking too at how many students are only getting the lower grades.\nA slightly higher proportion in Wales - 23.5% - got D and E grades, compared to 20.6% in England. That gap has also widened slightly too.\nWales has more students getting these lower grades in English (23.2%) than who managed A* to A (15.9%) in the same subject.\nThere is also a more students getting D and E grades in French in Wales than in England for most of the last six years.\nDavid Evans, secretary of NUT Wales, said A-levels were the first time students specialised in subjects and it was important the quality of education and teaching was there.\n\"We need to look at the numbers who get  A* and celebrate them, and those who get As, Bs and Cs too,\" he said.\n\"We need to make sure we have a clear focus on those who achieve the grades they need for university and makes sure support is there for those who go on to do other things as well.\"\nOn the question of whether A-levels are getting easier, Phil McTague, head teacher of Ysgol Eirias in Colwyn Bay said: \"If Usain Bolt sets a new record in the hundred metres, people don't say the hundred metres is getting easier!  Our students have worked really hard this year and we're proud of all their results.\"\nHOW DOES WALES COMPARE WITH ENGLISH REGIONS?\nFor the first time last year, we were able to compare Wales' results with regions of England on the day they were published.\nWales has the lowest percentage of A*-C grades of any area - 73.8- including every English region.\nIt also has the lowest for A* and A - apart from the North East of England, which is now lower than Wales.\nWHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS?\nGirls continue to outperform boys overall in Wales, with 97.9% of entries by girls this year gaining A* to E grades, compared to 96.5% of boys.\nAt the A* grade, the performance of boys was marginally better than that of girls, with 6.7% of boys and 6.5% of girls gaining A* - both improving since 2013.\nYou can also see performance differences between boys and girls for the top grades within subjects - as well as a difference in subjects chosen. The likes of physics and computing are very male dominated compared to French, English and Welsh at the other end of the scale.\nGareth Pierce, chief executive of the WJEC exam board, said some of the patterns were long standing \"and a natural feature\".\nWhy do more girls go to university?\nHOW MANY STUDENTS APPLY FROM WALES?\nThere were 23,740 students from Wales applying to universities in the UK this year - and with many looking at more than one university, this meant a total of 40,010 applications to Ucas.\nThere is very little difference in the number of students from Wales applying to university over the last few years.\nMore than half a million students got higher education places in the UK last year - three quarters of those who applied. These included 20,500 students from Wales, a 1.7% rise and a new high, while 87.5% of 18-year-olds from Wales who applied got places.\nOf those 18-year-old students who applied to Welsh universities, 84% got an offer, while 75% of Welsh applicants to English universities got an offer.\nAlthough there is a lot of attention at schools on results day - only around half of those entering university are 18-year-olds; others take gap years while the number of students over 26 is rising again.\nBy the end of Thursday, Ucas said 17,510 students from Wales had places in higher education - more than at the same time over the last five years.\nSTILL, MORE 18-YEAR-OLDS ARE GOING TO UNIVERSITY\nWales recorded its highest entry rate - 28.2% of all 18-year-olds got higher education places through Ucas in 2015 - although that is behind England on 31.3%.\nWales has had one of the lowest proportional increases of UK nations and regions since 2006 - 13%.\nWHERE YOU LIVE CAN BE A FACTOR\nFewer pupils from poorer parts of Wales get to university.\nEntry rates are broken down across the UK into constituencies and analysis shows they are lower in more disadvantaged areas.\nIn Wales, the entry rate range is from just under 18% of 18-year-olds in Aberavon, to just over 48% in Cardiff North.\nFor those in the most disadvantaged districts in Wales the average rate is 16.6%, almost the same as the year before.\nBut compared with entry rates five years ago, 18-year-olds from disadvantaged areas in Wales were 23% more likely to be accepted for entry in 2015 - in England they were 30% more likely.\nMeanwhile, students living in what are classed as the most advantaged areas of Wales are five-and-a-half times more likely to go to a university with higher entry requirements than those from the most disadvantaged parts.\nLeading academic Prof Sir Deian Hopkin said the numbers from poorer backgrounds getting to university were still disappointing despite efforts.\n\"One of the great challenges in higher education is to attract students from less-affluent backgrounds because. very often, they come from an education system which doesn't encourage them to come to university in the first place,\" he said.\n\"Now a lot has been done over the years, there has been a big improvement, but the proportion has not grown at the same rate as the total increase in students in higher education. Therefore the challenge remains.\"\nProf Hopkin added: \"The disappointment in England is that the grant which supported many students has been abolished.\n\"In Wales, at least that has been maintained for now, but we need to see far more effort being put into encouraging, supporting and, indeed, mentoring students from backgrounds where these things are not natural.\"\nWHERE DO STUDENTS AT WELSH UNIVERSITIES COME FROM?\nAltogether, 77,750 students have already applied to Welsh universities - 18,450 from within Wales.\nThe chart shows where the others come from - more than half of them from England.\nUNCONDITIONAL OFFERS ON THE RISE\nThere has been a rise in students receiving unconditional offers from universities - which will have relieved the exam pressure a little for some.

If I have money to go, I will go. I will take advantage of my age and my energy to help you out.'\"\nAbout half of the young people from Gonzaga move abroad in the hope of securing a better future.\nThe Home Office said Mr Menezes had been granted entry to the UK for six months as a visitor on his arrival on 13 March 2002.\nHe then applied for leave to remain as a student, which was approved. He was granted leave to remain until 30 June 2003.\nThe Home Office says his visa expired at that time and that he remained illegally in the UK until his death.\nLike many Brazilians in London, Mr Menezes would send money home to his parent's modest farm in Gonzaga.\n\"He didn't make a lot of money,\" his father said. \"Most of his money went on rent and food.\n\"He wanted to stay for another two years to save money so he could come back and invest in a ranch.\"\nHe said his son was happy in London.\nFriends say Mr Menezes was as shocked as all Londoners by the 7 July 2005 Tube and bus bombings, as well as the attempted London public transport attacks on Thursday 21 July - the day before he was shot.\nG\u00e9sio C\u00e9sar D'avila, a friend and colleague, said Mr Menezes had considered alternative transport after the failed attacks.\n\"We were together on Thursday, and when we saw what happened, Jean said he wanted to buy a motorbike to avoid the Tube,\" he said.\nOn 22 July, the day Mr Menezes was killed, police and soldiers had been watching the block of flats in Tulse Hill, where the electrician lived.\nThey believed Hussain Osman, one of the failed 21 July bombers, was living there. What they did not immediately realise was that the flats shared a communal entrance.\nIt is thought Mr Menezes left his flat, which he shared with cousins Vivian and Patricia, in order to fit a fire alarm.\nUndercover police officers began following Mr Menezes because they thought he looked like Osman.\nHe took a bus to Stockwell station, where he boarded a train. There he was pinned down and shot seven times in the head and once in the shoulder by two officers trained in stopping suicide bombers.\nPolice were later to say the officers had feared for their own lives and for those of other passengers on the train.\nIn the days that followed the shooting, a makeshift memorial to Mr Menezes was set up outside Stockwell Tube station.  The shrine of flowers, candles, pictures and newspaper articles became a gathering point for campaigners seeking answers over the incident.\nAlmost a year after his death, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that no officers would be prosecuted, but the Met Police would be tried for breaching health and safety laws.\nOn 1 November 2007, the force was found guilty at the Old Bailey of endangering the public over the operation that led to the shooting and fined \u00a3175,000 with \u00a3385,000 costs. A jury found the force broke health and safety laws when officers pursued Mr Menezes and shot him seven times\nAn inquest into Mr Menezes death began on 22 October 2008. The jury rejected the police account Mr de Menezes was killed lawfully by two officers and returned an open verdict. The coroner had instructed the jury not to return a verdict of unlawful killing, and gave it the choice of two possible verdicts.\nThe Met Police settled a damages claim with Mr Menezes family in 2009. The amount of compensation the family will receive was not disclosed.\nIn January 2010, Menezes family members and campaigners gathered at Stockwell station on what would have been his 32nd birthday to unveil a permanent memorial. A colourful mosaic framing a photograph of Mr Menezes was created by local artist Mary Edwards.\n\nSummary 1:\nJean Charles de Menezes, a Brazilian electrician, was mistakenly shot and killed by London police on July 22, 2005, while being mistaken for a suicide bomber.\n\nSummary 2:\nNearly a decade after the police shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, his family have brought a case at the European Court of Human Rights in an attempt to see someone prosecuted over the 27-year-old's killing.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

A jury found the force broke health and safety laws when officers pursued Mr Menezes and shot him seven times\nAn inquest into Mr Menezes death began on 22 October 2008. The jury rejected the police account Mr de Menezes was killed lawfully by two officers and returned an open verdict. The coroner had instructed the jury not to return a verdict of unlawful killing, and gave it the choice of two possible verdicts.\nThe Met Police settled a damages claim with Mr Menezes family in 2009. The amount of compensation the family will receive was not disclosed.\nIn January 2010, Menezes family members and campaigners gathered at Stockwell station on what would have been his 32nd birthday to unveil a permanent memorial. A colourful mosaic framing a photograph of Mr Menezes was created by local artist Mary Edwards.\n\nSummary 1:\nJean Charles de Menezes, a Brazilian electrician, was mistakenly shot and killed by London police on July 22, 2005, while being mistaken for a suicide bomber.\n\nSummary 2:\nNearly a decade after the police shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, his family have brought a case at the European Court of Human Rights in an attempt to see someone prosecuted over the 27-year-old's killing.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

The jury's decision should \"end the litigation\", he said, and force J&J to settle the remaining cases.\nAnalysis: James Gallagher, health editor, BBC news website\nIs talc safe?\nThere have been concerns for years that using talcum powder, particularly on the genitals, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer.\nBut the evidence is not conclusive. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc used on the genitals as \"possibly carcinogenic\" because of the mixed evidence.\nWhy is there any debate?\nThe mineral talc in its natural form does contain asbestos and does cause cancer. However, asbestos-free talc has been used in baby powder and other cosmetics since the 1970s. But the studies on asbestos-free talc give contradictory results.\nIt has been linked to a cancer risk in some studies, but there are concerns that the research may be biased as the studies often rely on people remembering how much talc they used years ago. Other studies have argued there is no link at all and there is no link between talc in contraceptives such as diaphragms and condoms (which would be close to the ovaries) and cancer.\nAlso, there does not seem to be a \"dose-response\" for talc, unlike with known carcinogens like tobacco where the more you smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer.\nThe charity Ovacome says there is no definitive evidence and that the worst-case scenario is that using talc increases the risk of cancer by a third.\nBut it adds: \"Ovarian cancer is a rare disease, and increasing a small risk by a third still gives a small risk. So even if talc does increase the risk slightly, very few women who use talc will ever get ovarian cancer.\"\nA J&J spokeswoman said the verdict contradicted 30 years of research supporting the safety of cosmetic talc.\nCarol Goodrich said the company intends to appeal and will keep defending its products' safety.\nThe case follows another one in February, in which Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $72m to the family of a woman who claimed her death was linked to use of the company's Baby Powder talc.\nJackie Fox from Birmingham, Alabama died of ovarian cancer last year, aged 62, having used the talc for decades.\nHer family argued that the firm knew of talc risks and failed to warn users.\nJ&J is appealing against that verdict, which sparked renewed interest in talc-powder lawsuits. Lawyers accuse J&J of failing to warn that talc was linked to an increased risk for ovarian cancer - a claim J&J denies. There are 1,200 other cases pending.\nJ&J shares were down 18 cents in after-hours trading to $112.57.\n\nSummary 1:\nPharmaceutical firm Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has been ordered to pay more than $55m (\u00a340m) in compensation to an American  woman who says its talcum powder caused her ovarian cancer.\n\nSummary 2:\nA Missouri jury has awarded $55 million to a 62-year-old woman who claimed Johnson & Johnson's talc-based products caused her ovarian cancer, despite the company's insistence on their safety.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

It's very hard to ignore that.\n\"He's got his game organised and he's shown himself to be a consistent performer.\n\"I've done it myself - if you can bat a long time, see off the new ball and bat out that first session, you're setting a platform for the team to get big runs. He's done that brilliantly.\"\n\nSummary 1:\nLancashire clinched promotion back to Division One of the County Championship after they drew with Leicestershire on Saturday and Essex failed to beat Kent.\n\nSummary 2:\nLancashire has secured an immediate return to the top tier of English cricket with two games left to play, needing just 12 more points to be crowned champions.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

We are working on that but it is looking good.\"\nThe supporters will have a smile for one afternoon, one night, and it is not the easiest time for the country at the moment\nAlonso qualified only fifth in Spain but fought through to win after moving up to third on the first lap and then using an aggressive four-stop strategy that allowed him to exploit the Ferrari's race pace.\nIt was his second victory of the year, to follow on from a win in China last month, and he finished second to Raikkonen in Australia, the only other race in which he has not had problems.\nIn Malaysia, he damaged his front wing in a collision with Vettel on lap one and then retired when it broke after he did not come in to change it.\nIn Bahrain, he finished eighth after problems with his DRS overtaking aid.\nAlonso said: \"We have only had five races in the championship. In these five races, we have nearly two retirements and without this we were maybe leading now a little comfortably.\n\"So what we need to do is have consistent podium results for the next four or five races and that will bring us a lot of points to put in the pocket.\"\nAlonso had a scare when one of his tyres got a puncture before his final pit stop, but the team were able to bring him in two laps earlier than planned to avoid a problem.\n\"We decided to play safe after Malaysia, where we were a little bit brave trying to do one extra lap with the front wing broken and we crashed in that lap.\n\"Here it could have affected the strategy because it was stopping too early, but it was OK and didn't affect the result.\"\nThe victory was Alonso's third in his home country, following his 2006 Spanish Grand Prix win for Renault and last year's victory in the European Grand Prix in Valencia.\nHe was cheered by the packed grandstands and afterwards paid tribute to the fans, making a reference to the troubled economic situation in Spain as a result of the Eurozone crisis.\n\"It is fantastic,\" he said. \"Winning at home is always like you did it for the first time. It is the third time for me but each time is always different, like a new experience.\n\"The supporters will have a smile for one afternoon, one night, and it is not the easiest time for the country at the moment, so I'm happy for them and thanks to them for the support.\"\nRaikkonen finished runner-up to Alonso, his third second place in a row, and said: \"We are here to try to win races and championships. I want to win; the team wants to win.\n\"It's disappointing to finish second but if anything we gained some points on Sebastian today so something good came out of today.\n\"It helps if you cannot win to be second but I don't think it is enough in the long run.

Another is seen apparently being trampled on.\nThis is the worst single loss of life for Russia since it launched its air offensive in Syria in support of President Assad towards the end of last year.\nMoscow says the helicopter was not involved in a military mission, but was delivering humanitarian aid.  Rebel sources appear to confirm this.  It may not have been known to those who shot the helicopter down, as most of Russia's airpower in Syria has been used for military purposes to support pro-government forces.\nBut it will further inflame feelings in Russia against rebels in Syria.

Another is seen apparently being trampled on.\nThis is the worst single loss of life for Russia since it launched its air offensive in Syria in support of President Assad towards the end of last year.\nMoscow says the helicopter was not involved in a military mission, but was delivering humanitarian aid.  Rebel sources appear to confirm this.  It may not have been known to those who shot the helicopter down, as most of Russia's airpower in Syria has been used for military purposes to support pro-government forces.\nBut it will further inflame feelings in Russia against rebels in Syria.  Moscow has repeatedly said it sees little distinction between the rebels in terms of brutality and extremism.  The graphic images of victims posted online of the aftermath of the incident will add fuel to the fire.\nRussia has previously, though seldom, lost aircraft since it launched operations in support of the Syrian government at the end of September 2015.\nIn July, two Russian pilots were killed when their helicopter was shot down east of the city of Palmyra by so-called Islamic State (IS).\nLast November, the pilot of a Russian Su-24 fighter plane was killed when the aircraft was shot down by Turkey on its border with Syria.\nA Russian marine sent on a mission to rescue the pilot was also killed when his helicopter was shot down.\nRussia is a key backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and is supporting pro-government forces with air strikes on rebels.\nGovernment forces cut off rebel-held eastern parts of Aleppo last month.\nRussia and Syria announced the opening of what they called humanitarian corridors for civilians and rebels wanting to surrender, but few people are reported to have used them, fearing they would be targeted.\nThe child sitcom star killed in Aleppo\nBurning tyres to curb air strikes\nOpposition activists have dismissed as a lie Russian claims that 160 civilians had left rebel-held districts.\nThe United Nations has warned that basic supplies for the around a quarter of a million people who live in besieged areas will last only three weeks.\nOn Sunday, rebel groups south of Aleppo launched a push to try to break the siege, in what observers said was one of the biggest counter-offensives in months.\n\nSummary 1:\nA Russian Mi-8 helicopter was shot down by rebels in northern Idlib province, killing five people, while delivering humanitarian aid to besieged Aleppo, according to the Russian defense ministry.\n\nSummary 2:\nA Russian military helicopter has been shot down in Syria killing all five on board - the deadliest single incident for Russia's military since its air campaign began last September.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

We are just students and we also condemn anti-India slogans. Our president had nothing to do with those slogans at the event,\" a student tells me.\nBut she refuses to speak on camera.\n\"I don't want to be seen on camera. I am worried about my safety,\" she says.\nStudent activist Shreya Ghosh speaks of the fear prevailing inside the university.\n\"We have been sleeping in different rooms every night to avoid arrest,\" she says.\nAnother student activist Deepshita claims that ideological politics lies at the heart of Mr Kumar's arrest.\n\"Right-wing students want to increase their foothold in the university and that is why they got him [Mr Kumar] arrested.

Many here view the use of the Ukrainian language as central to the country's identity.\nThey believe that - after centuries of Russian and Soviet hegemony - to be a true Ukrainian, one must speak Ukrainian.\nAnything less is to surrender to the country's one-time cultural and political masters in Moscow - where many still view Ukraine as a Russian appendage - and ultimately threatens the country's continued independence.\n\"This law is sending an incredibly powerful signal that the Ukrainian language is not needed,\" said Roman Tsupryk, a political commentator and chairman of the editorial board of the Ukrainian weekly \"Tyzhden\" (Week).\n\"People don't see the mechanism behind it, but they will see the consequences in a year or a year and half.\"\nPeople in the country's Russian-speaking east and south have a predictably different view on the matter.\nThey say that they are patriotic Ukrainians - just ones that speak another language - and they simply wish to have the right to speak their native tongue in courts, government offices and schools, as the new legislation stipulates.\nThey also bristle at the accusation - especially in the country's west, where Ukrainian is predominantly spoken - that they are any less Ukrainian than the rest of the country.\n\"I speak Russian - what's the big problem?\" said Ruslan, a taxi driver in the eastern city of Donetsk, who asked to use only his first name.\n\"Why do people in the west get to say who is Ukrainian and who isn't?\"\nGiven the intense emotions on either side of the language debate, however, the question arises why President Viktor Yanukovych's ruling Party of Regions chose this moment to stir up this particular hornet's nest?\nSome analysts believe the new language law is an opening salvo in the government's campaign for parliamentary elections in October.\nThe law, touching on a cultural hot button, they say, serves a dual purpose - it distracts the electorate from more pressing issues like Ukraine's continued economic slump, and it riles up the political \"base.\"\n\"Every time we have elections, the issue of language is there,\" said Oleh Rybachuk, a cabinet member in the previous government and now an independent analyst.\n\"Language is not so important - it is not among the top 15 priorities of the people. But for some reason, every time we have elections, we have that issue.\"\nAccording to Mr Rybachuk, however, opposition politicians also welcome this issue, since it allows them to mobilise their own constituency.

Many here view the use of the Ukrainian language as central to the country's identity.\nThey believe that - after centuries of Russian and Soviet hegemony - to be a true Ukrainian, one must speak Ukrainian.\nAnything less is to surrender to the country's one-time cultural and political masters in Moscow - where many still view Ukraine as a Russian appendage - and ultimately threatens the country's continued independence.\n\"This law is sending an incredibly powerful signal that the Ukrainian language is not needed,\" said Roman Tsupryk, a political commentator and chairman of the editorial board of the Ukrainian weekly \"Tyzhden\" (Week).\n\"People don't see the mechanism behind it, but they will see the consequences in a year or a year and half.\"\nPeople in the country's Russian-speaking east and south have a predictably different view on the matter.\nThey say that they are patriotic Ukrainians - just ones that speak another language - and they simply wish to have the right to speak their native tongue in courts, government offices and schools, as the new legislation stipulates.\nThey also bristle at the accusation - especially in the country's west, where Ukrainian is predominantly spoken - that they are any less Ukrainian than the rest of the country.\n\"I speak Russian - what's the big problem?\" said Ruslan, a taxi driver in the eastern city of Donetsk, who asked to use only his first name.\n\"Why do people in the west get to say who is Ukrainian and who isn't?\"\nGiven the intense emotions on either side of the language debate, however, the question arises why President Viktor Yanukovych's ruling Party of Regions chose this moment to stir up this particular hornet's nest?\nSome analysts believe the new language law is an opening salvo in the government's campaign for parliamentary elections in October.\nThe law, touching on a cultural hot button, they say, serves a dual purpose - it distracts the electorate from more pressing issues like Ukraine's continued economic slump, and it riles up the political \"base.\"\n\"Every time we have elections, the issue of language is there,\" said Oleh Rybachuk, a cabinet member in the previous government and now an independent analyst.\n\"Language is not so important - it is not among the top 15 priorities of the people. But for some reason, every time we have elections, we have that issue.\"\nAccording to Mr Rybachuk, however, opposition politicians also welcome this issue, since it allows them to mobilise their own constituency. But this could have disastrous consequences.\n\"This kind of cementing of constituencies really divides the country,\" he says, adding that the unrest \"creates space for radicals from both side.\"\n\"It's easy to provoke a conflict, to shed blood,\" he adds.\nGranted, not all of Ukraine is divided into two opposing camps - and it remains to be seen how this pro and anti-Russian stand-off will play out among the rest of the population.\nA short, informal survey around the capital Kiev, a city which speaks both Russian and Ukrainian, yielded (tentatively) some unpredictable results.\nA number of native Russian speakers said that they were against giving Russian official status.

Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company.\nSome users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road.\nAmerican actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious.\nOthers renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot).\nAmerican director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket.\n2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.

How can we trust what they say this time?\nThe weight given to the reports of the IPCC is a measure of the global scale of scientific involvement with the panel.\nDivided into three working groups that look at the physical science, the impacts and options to limit climate change, the panel involves thousands of scientists around the world.\nThe first report, to be presented in Stockholm, has 209 lead authors and 50 review editors from 39 countries.\nThe 30-page Summary for Policymakers that will be published after review by government officials in the Swedish capital is based on around 9,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers and 50,000 comments from the expert reviewers.\nBut among these icebergs of data, things can and do go awry.\nIn the last report, published in 2007, there were a handful of well publicised errors, including the claim that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035. The wrong percentage was also given for the amount of land in the Netherlands under sea level.\nThe IPCC admitted it had got it wrong and explained that, in a report running to 3,000 pages, there were bound to be some mistakes. The Himalayan claim came from the inclusion of an interview that had been published in the magazine New Scientist.\nIn its own words, the IPCC is there \"to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts\".\nThe offspring of two UN bodies, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, it has issued four heavyweight assessment reports to date on the state of the climate.\nThese are commissioned by the governments of 195 countries, essentially the entire world. These reports are critical in informing the climate policies adopted by these governments.\nThe IPCC itself is a small organisation, run from Geneva with a full time staff of 12. All the scientists who are involved with it do so on a voluntary basis.\nIn 2009, a review of the way the IPCC assesses information suggested the panel should be very clear in future about the sources of the information it uses.\nThe panel was also scarred by association with the \"Climategate\" rumpus. Leaked emails between scientists working for the IPCC were stolen and published in 2009.\nThey purported to show some collusion between researchers to make climate data fit the theory of human-induced global warming more clearly. However at least three investigations found no evidence to support this conclusion.\nBut the overall effect of these events on the panel has been to make them more cautious.\nAlthough this new report is likely to stress a greater certainty among scientists that human activities are causing climate warming, in terms of the scale, level and impacts, the word \"uncertainty\" features heavily.\n\"What we are seeing now is that this working group is getting more careful than they already were,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, chief scientist at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\n\"Overall, the message is, in that sense, more conservative I expect, for this IPCC report compared to previous ones.\"\nHasn't global warming stopped since 1998?\nThe 2007 IPCC report made no mention of any slowdown or standstill in temperature rises in recent decades. They pointed out that the linear warming trend over the previous 50 years was 0.13C per decade, which was twice that for the past 100 years.\nThey forecast that, if emissions of carbon dioxide continued on their existing path, over the next century the climate would respond by warming between 2C and 4.5C, with a most likely rise of 3C.\nBut since 2007, climate sceptics have loudly argued that global average temperatures haven't actually gone above the level recorded in 1998.\nThe issue is now being taken more seriously by the IPCC and other respected science organisations.\nMy colleague David Shukman summarised some of the explanations now being offered as to why the temperatures have not risen more quickly in line with the modelling.\nMost scientists believe that the warming has continued over the past 15 years, but more of the heat has gone into the oceans. They are unsure about the mechanisms driving this change in behaviour.\nThe most recent peer reviewed article suggested that a periodic, natural cooling of the Pacific Ocean was counteracting the impact of carbon dioxide.\n\"1998 was a particular hot year due to a record-breaking El Ni\u00f1o event, while recently we have had mostly the opposite - cool conditions in the tropical Pacific,\" Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told BBC News.\n\"That warming has not stopped can be seen from the ongoing heat accumulation in the global oceans.\"\nClimate sceptics, however, argue that the pause is evidence that climate models used by the IPCC are too sensitive and exaggerate the effects of carbon dioxide.\n\"In the last year, we have seen several studies showing that climate sensitivity is actually much less than we thought for the last 30 years,\" said Marcel Crok, a Dutch author who is sceptical of the IPCC process.\n\"These studies show that our real climate has a sensitivity of between 1.5C and 2.0C. But the models are much more sensitive, and warm up three degrees.\"\nAm I going to get flooded?\nThe 2007 IPCC report was heavily criticised for its estimations on sea level rise.\nThe panel suggested that a warming planet would see waters around the world rise by between 18cm and 59cm by the end of this century. Heat causes the seas to expand but also increases the rate of melting of glaciers and ice sheets.\nThe IPCC doesn't commission any new science, but reviews and condenses existing peer reviewed material.\nEach Summary for Policymakers is a short distillation of an underlying report that can stretch to several hundred pages. The final draft of the short summary is presented to representatives of the 195 governments who commission the report.\nIn a hectic week before publication, every single line is gone through by the scientists and civil servants. The lead authors are in the room and can veto a change if it isn't supported in the underlying report.\nThe IPCC figure didn't include any estimates for the extra water coming from the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets as they said they didn't have enough accurate information.\nOther researchers were critical of this approach and have published studies that suggested a far higher sea level rise.\nBut in recent months, a study funded by the European Union and involving scientists across the world, came up with what they believe is the most accurate estimate yet - and it increases the level of sea rise by just 10cm from the IPCC report.\n\"What we are talking about is a reduction in uncertainty - we find we haven't changed the number enormously compared to AR4 (IPCC 2007 report),\" said Prof David Vaughan, from the British Antarctic Survey (Bas), while speaking at the launch of the report.\n\"We've added maybe another 10cm but the level of certainty we have around that is actually higher than it was in the AR4.\"\nLeaked details from the forthcoming report indicate that the worst sea level rise scenarios for the year 2100, under the highest emissions of carbon dioxide, could reach 97cm.\nSome scientists, including Prof Rahmstorf, have been unhappy with the models used by the IPCC to calculate the rise.

How can we trust what they say this time?\nThe weight given to the reports of the IPCC is a measure of the global scale of scientific involvement with the panel.\nDivided into three working groups that look at the physical science, the impacts and options to limit climate change, the panel involves thousands of scientists around the world.\nThe first report, to be presented in Stockholm, has 209 lead authors and 50 review editors from 39 countries.\nThe 30-page Summary for Policymakers that will be published after review by government officials in the Swedish capital is based on around 9,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers and 50,000 comments from the expert reviewers.\nBut among these icebergs of data, things can and do go awry.\nIn the last report, published in 2007, there were a handful of well publicised errors, including the claim that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035. The wrong percentage was also given for the amount of land in the Netherlands under sea level.\nThe IPCC admitted it had got it wrong and explained that, in a report running to 3,000 pages, there were bound to be some mistakes. The Himalayan claim came from the inclusion of an interview that had been published in the magazine New Scientist.\nIn its own words, the IPCC is there \"to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts\".\nThe offspring of two UN bodies, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, it has issued four heavyweight assessment reports to date on the state of the climate.\nThese are commissioned by the governments of 195 countries, essentially the entire world. These reports are critical in informing the climate policies adopted by these governments.\nThe IPCC itself is a small organisation, run from Geneva with a full time staff of 12. All the scientists who are involved with it do so on a voluntary basis.\nIn 2009, a review of the way the IPCC assesses information suggested the panel should be very clear in future about the sources of the information it uses.\nThe panel was also scarred by association with the \"Climategate\" rumpus. Leaked emails between scientists working for the IPCC were stolen and published in 2009.\nThey purported to show some collusion between researchers to make climate data fit the theory of human-induced global warming more clearly. However at least three investigations found no evidence to support this conclusion.\nBut the overall effect of these events on the panel has been to make them more cautious.\nAlthough this new report is likely to stress a greater certainty among scientists that human activities are causing climate warming, in terms of the scale, level and impacts, the word \"uncertainty\" features heavily.\n\"What we are seeing now is that this working group is getting more careful than they already were,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, chief scientist at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\n\"Overall, the message is, in that sense, more conservative I expect, for this IPCC report compared to previous ones.\"\nHasn't global warming stopped since 1998?\nThe 2007 IPCC report made no mention of any slowdown or standstill in temperature rises in recent decades. They pointed out that the linear warming trend over the previous 50 years was 0.13C per decade, which was twice that for the past 100 years.\nThey forecast that, if emissions of carbon dioxide continued on their existing path, over the next century the climate would respond by warming between 2C and 4.5C, with a most likely rise of 3C.\nBut since 2007, climate sceptics have loudly argued that global average temperatures haven't actually gone above the level recorded in 1998.\nThe issue is now being taken more seriously by the IPCC and other respected science organisations.\nMy colleague David Shukman summarised some of the explanations now being offered as to why the temperatures have not risen more quickly in line with the modelling.\nMost scientists believe that the warming has continued over the past 15 years, but more of the heat has gone into the oceans. They are unsure about the mechanisms driving this change in behaviour.\nThe most recent peer reviewed article suggested that a periodic, natural cooling of the Pacific Ocean was counteracting the impact of carbon dioxide.\n\"1998 was a particular hot year due to a record-breaking El Ni\u00f1o event, while recently we have had mostly the opposite - cool conditions in the tropical Pacific,\" Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told BBC News.\n\"That warming has not stopped can be seen from the ongoing heat accumulation in the global oceans.\"\nClimate sceptics, however, argue that the pause is evidence that climate models used by the IPCC are too sensitive and exaggerate the effects of carbon dioxide.\n\"In the last year, we have seen several studies showing that climate sensitivity is actually much less than we thought for the last 30 years,\" said Marcel Crok, a Dutch author who is sceptical of the IPCC process.\n\"These studies show that our real climate has a sensitivity of between 1.5C and 2.0C. But the models are much more sensitive, and warm up three degrees.\"\nAm I going to get flooded?\nThe 2007 IPCC report was heavily criticised for its estimations on sea level rise.\nThe panel suggested that a warming planet would see waters around the world rise by between 18cm and 59cm by the end of this century. Heat causes the seas to expand but also increases the rate of melting of glaciers and ice sheets.\nThe IPCC doesn't commission any new science, but reviews and condenses existing peer reviewed material.\nEach Summary for Policymakers is a short distillation of an underlying report that can stretch to several hundred pages. The final draft of the short summary is presented to representatives of the 195 governments who commission the report.\nIn a hectic week before publication, every single line is gone through by the scientists and civil servants. The lead authors are in the room and can veto a change if it isn't supported in the underlying report.\nThe IPCC figure didn't include any estimates for the extra water coming from the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets as they said they didn't have enough accurate information.\nOther researchers were critical of this approach and have published studies that suggested a far higher sea level rise.\nBut in recent months, a study funded by the European Union and involving scientists across the world, came up with what they believe is the most accurate estimate yet - and it increases the level of sea rise by just 10cm from the IPCC report.\n\"What we are talking about is a reduction in uncertainty - we find we haven't changed the number enormously compared to AR4 (IPCC 2007 report),\" said Prof David Vaughan, from the British Antarctic Survey (Bas), while speaking at the launch of the report.\n\"We've added maybe another 10cm but the level of certainty we have around that is actually higher than it was in the AR4.\"\nLeaked details from the forthcoming report indicate that the worst sea level rise scenarios for the year 2100, under the highest emissions of carbon dioxide, could reach 97cm.\nSome scientists, including Prof Rahmstorf, have been unhappy with the models used by the IPCC to calculate the rise. Using what's termed a semi-empirical model, the projections for sea level can reach 2m. At that point, an extra 187 million people across the world would be flooded.\nBut the IPCC is likely to say that there is no consensus about the semi-empirical approach and will stick with the lower figure of just under 1m.\nSo will all this mean more flooding?\n\"Yes, but not everywhere,\" said Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds. \"Generally, the wet regions will get wetter and the dry ones drier.\"\nThe report is also likely to assess the intensity of storms, and there might be some better news in that there is likely to be a downwards revision.\nAnd what about the Polar bears?\nThe state of the North and South Poles has been of growing concern to science as the effects of global warming are said to be more intense in these regions.\nThe IPCC has evolved a complicated way of communicating scientific certainty and confidence in a finding:\nvery unlikely - 0-10%\nunlikely - 10-33%\nlikely as not - 33-66%\nlikely - 66-100%\nvery likely - 90-100%\nExtremely likely - 95-100%\nVirtually certain - 99-100%\nConfidence is also expressed as very low, low, medium, high and very high.\nEvidence can can be limited, medium or robust.\nAnd levels of agreement can be low, medium or high\nIn 2007, the IPCC said that temperatures in the Arctic increased at almost twice the global average rate in the past 100 years.

In the past five years, 266 of these procedures have been carried out on girls under 14.\nWhile the reasons for the procedures are unknown, they are likely to have been performed for medical reasons or to correct congenital abnormalities.\nIn another paper, published by the British Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Gynaecology (BritSPAG), clinicians are advised to inform girls under 18 that labiaplasty surgery before puberty is complete can lead to long-term problems.\nAlthough no research has been carried out on these long-term risks, it is thought that damage to sexual function and sensitivity can occur after labiaplasty. Bleeding and wound infection can also occur in the short term.\nThe paper also recommends that girls showing signs of psychological problems should be referred to a paediatric clinical psychologist.\nConsultant plastic surgeon Paul Banwell, from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, welcomed the recommendations published in both papers and said patients should always be given full, accurate information and be properly counselled before surgery.\nBut he said clinicians should also be sensitive to potential problems.\n\"An asymmetrical labia can lead to functional problems as well as aesthetic problems. Over 50% of my patients see me due to functional reasons. Only a small proportion are there for purely aesthetic reasons.\"\nHe also said he had seen the number of patients requesting labiaplasty increase dramatically in the past few years.\nTim Goodacre, head of professional standards at the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons and a consultant plastic surgeon, said he supported the recommendations as a means of improving patient care.\n\"We would like to see tougher central regulation of the cosmetic surgery industry to help clamp down on anyone performing these operations unnecessarily, and without due consideration for patient care.\"\nBut he said he found attempts to increase profits by encouraging more female genital procedures \"abhorrent\".\nHe added: \"We urge stringent and robust restrictions on advertising such operations with a firm objective to limit any material other than that with information only. All advertising that could in any way be seen as persuasive should be banned.\"\n\nSummary 1:\n\"Designer vagina\" surgery should not be carried out on the NHS or on girls under the age of 18, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has said.\n\nSummary 2:\nA new report recommends that women and girls be informed of the normal variations in female genitalia and the risks of labiaplasty, as the procedure has increased fivefold in the past decade.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

But it's rarely as speedy as in Natalie Bennett's case.\nThe Australian-born former Guardian journalist woke up on New Year's Day 2006 and decided she wanted to do something to change the world.\nAfter pondering her options (should she get involved with an NGO or the UN?) she joined the Green Party. Within six short years she had become its leader.\nThree years after that she was sharing a stage with the prime minister and other party leaders in a televised general election debate.\nHer sudden arrival on the frontline of British politics was all the more remarkable because she had never won an election, other than the one that had made her party leader.\nHer first aim when she took on the job was to insert the Green Party - routinely ignored or patronised by the mainstream media - into the national conversation.\nBut when media outlets finally began calling, on the back of a surge in support for the party, she sometimes found it difficult to get her message across in a suitably snappy way.\nHer vision for the party was to show how \"economic and environmental justice are indivisible\", she explains, \"the idea that tackling environmental problems isn't an add-on luxury\".\nIt was \"not a easy concept to get across\", she confesses. \"I still don't think I've got the 12 second soundbite. But I am going to keep working on it.\"\n\"It's a classic Shakespearean thing,\" she says of her struggles with the broadcast media. \"It's both my strength and my weakness that I answer the question.\"\nBut, she adds, \"when you get asked a stupid question, it's rather hard to know what to do at that point. And I guess I get tangled up in my desire to answer a question, even when it's a really stupid question\".\nDid she get asked a lot of stupid questions?\n\"Yes.\"\nAsked for an example, she ponders for a minute, before highlighting an interview with the BBC's very own John Humphrys, which led to her having \"to spend time, valuable peak time, explaining how the interviewer got the question wrong. And listeners don't particularly like that because it's all technical and boring and you are arguing with the interviewer but if it's entirely on the wrong track you have to\".\nShe says she has some sympathy with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has also attracted criticism for broadcast interviews in which he has deviated from the usual prepared soundbites.\n\"The focus on the individual is a problem for British politics and it's very uncomfortable when the focus is on you,\" she says, arguing that the media in continental Europe are focused more on policies than personalities and trivia.\n\"I am not complaining - you have to work within those limits,\" she adds, but she believes British politics is \"broken\" and the media must take its share of the blame.\n\"There should be some pressure on the journalist to ask better, more sensible questions,\" she argues.\nThere was nothing particularly stupid about the question that prompted her darkest moment in a radio studio, however, when she struggled over several excruciating minutes, punctuated by coughing fits, to answer a question from LBC's Nick Ferrari on her party's housing policy.\nShe was quick to hold her hands up afterwards, apologising to supporters and blaming her sub-par performance, in the heat of the general election campaign, on \"brain freeze\".\n\"That was a very tough moment. And of course you take a bit of a punch to the stomach.\n\"But then a few weeks later I was up on the leader debates, able to look David Cameron in the eye and challenge him about his failure to welcome Syrian refugees to Britain, and that was one of the best moments.\n\"My great problem on that day was that I was in no way well enough to actually be doing anything. I'd had about three and a half hours sleep and I'd been throwing up most of the night. I should have just pulled the day but that's partly a function of how we got to that point.\n\"We weren't used to getting a lot of media attention and it was very, very hard to turn media attention down.\"\nOne of Ms Bennett's proudest moments came at the end of the BBC leaders debate when she joined Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in a \"group hug\", while Labour leader Ed Miliband looked on awkwardly.\nThis felt like a watershed moment for women in politics, she says, sending out the message \"that politics can not just be 'dog eat dog', it can be people agreeing on some things and disagreeing on others but supporting each other\".\nAs a lifelong feminist, she is particularly pleased to have been told by \"lots of young women\" that they had been inspired by the \"group hug\", which she stresses had not been planned in advance.\n\"I hope and think that that moment really, in 15 years' time, 20 years' time, we might see a whole crop of MPs down the road who will reference that moment as the time they decided they were going to try and get there.\"\nMs Bennett's decision to pitch for the anti-austerity vote, positioning the Greens as a left-wing alternative to what was then Ed Miliband's Labour Party, struck a chord with idealistic young people who felt alienated by mainstream politics, and led to a surge in party membership.\nBut then Jeremy Corbyn came along and shifted Labour firmly to the left, inspiring idealistic activists to join his party in numbers the Greens could only dream about.\nHasn't the Green Party, which had a mixed set of results in May's elections, losing four councillors in England and failing to make progress in Wales but getting its best ever result in London, been crowded out of the picture by Labour?\nMs Bennett insists this is not the case, arguing that there is a \"very clear distinction\" between the Greens and Labour on a range of issues - from nuclear weapons to fracking - and that voters know exactly what they are getting when they vote Green.\nBut she is also open to the idea of a \"progressive alliance\" at the next general election, with local Green Parties potentially making electoral pacts with Labour, Plaid Cymru, the SNP or other parties who broadly share their outlook.\nShe remains a passionate advocate of electoral reform. The Green Party fielded a record number of general election candidates in 2015, standing in 93% of constituencies, and gaining more than a million votes. By rights, she argues, the party should have 25 MPs. She believes the case for scrapping what she sees as Britain's outdated first-past-the-post electoral system is gaining ground in the country.\nShe says she has had an \"amazing\" four years as leader, and has no regrets, believing the party is in better shape now, having quadrupled its membership and gained a foothold in the national debate on issues such as welfare and the economy, than when she took over.\nBut she is also keen to stress that she will not be leaving politics.\n\"I'm aiming to turn former leader into a role in its own right, to keep travelling the country, supporting local parties, doing media. Leadership is a role we can share around. It's not you become leader, that's the pinnacle, and then you disappear.\"\nAsked if she has any advice for the next leader, she says trust the party membership.\nAnything else?\n\"Work out how to answer stupid questions,\" she laughs. \"I still don't quite know the answer to that one myself.\"\n\nSummary 1:\nNatalie Bennett, a former Guardian journalist, rose rapidly through the Green Party ranks to become its leader, navigating challenges with broadcast media and advocating for electoral reform.\n\nSummary 2:\nAs the Green Party of England and Wales prepares to unveil a replacement for Natalie Bennett, who is standing down after four years as leader, she reflects on life in the media spotlight - and what she plans to do next.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

I should have just pulled the day but that's partly a function of how we got to that point.\n\"We weren't used to getting a lot of media attention and it was very, very hard to turn media attention down.\"\nOne of Ms Bennett's proudest moments came at the end of the BBC leaders debate when she joined Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in a \"group hug\", while Labour leader Ed Miliband looked on awkwardly.\nThis felt like a watershed moment for women in politics, she says, sending out the message \"that politics can not just be 'dog eat dog', it can be people agreeing on some things and disagreeing on others but supporting each other\".\nAs a lifelong feminist, she is particularly pleased to have been told by \"lots of young women\" that they had been inspired by the \"group hug\", which she stresses had not been planned in advance.\n\"I hope and think that that moment really, in 15 years' time, 20 years' time, we might see a whole crop of MPs down the road who will reference that moment as the time they decided they were going to try and get there.\"\nMs Bennett's decision to pitch for the anti-austerity vote, positioning the Greens as a left-wing alternative to what was then Ed Miliband's Labour Party, struck a chord with idealistic young people who felt alienated by mainstream politics, and led to a surge in party membership.\nBut then Jeremy Corbyn came along and shifted Labour firmly to the left, inspiring idealistic activists to join his party in numbers the Greens could only dream about.\nHasn't the Green Party, which had a mixed set of results in May's elections, losing four councillors in England and failing to make progress in Wales but getting its best ever result in London, been crowded out of the picture by Labour?\nMs Bennett insists this is not the case, arguing that there is a \"very clear distinction\" between the Greens and Labour on a range of issues - from nuclear weapons to fracking - and that voters know exactly what they are getting when they vote Green.\nBut she is also open to the idea of a \"progressive alliance\" at the next general election, with local Green Parties potentially making electoral pacts with Labour, Plaid Cymru, the SNP or other parties who broadly share their outlook.\nShe remains a passionate advocate of electoral reform. The Green Party fielded a record number of general election candidates in 2015, standing in 93% of constituencies, and gaining more than a million votes. By rights, she argues, the party should have 25 MPs. She believes the case for scrapping what she sees as Britain's outdated first-past-the-post electoral system is gaining ground in the country.\nShe says she has had an \"amazing\" four years as leader, and has no regrets, believing the party is in better shape now, having quadrupled its membership and gained a foothold in the national debate on issues such as welfare and the economy, than when she took over.\nBut she is also keen to stress that she will not be leaving politics.\n\"I'm aiming to turn former leader into a role in its own right, to keep travelling the country, supporting local parties, doing media. Leadership is a role we can share around. It's not you become leader, that's the pinnacle, and then you disappear.\"\nAsked if she has any advice for the next leader, she says trust the party membership.\nAnything else?\n\"Work out how to answer stupid questions,\" she laughs. \"I still don't quite know the answer to that one myself.\"\n\nSummary 1:\nNatalie Bennett, a former Guardian journalist, rose rapidly through the Green Party ranks to become its leader, navigating challenges with broadcast media and advocating for electoral reform.\n\nSummary 2:\nAs the Green Party of England and Wales prepares to unveil a replacement for Natalie Bennett, who is standing down after four years as leader, she reflects on life in the media spotlight - and what she plans to do next.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

Being at home one day a week has enabled him to spend more time with his three children now aged 14, 12 and 9.\n\"At the time [when I asked] I was a relatively new partner and also a relatively new dad and had two young children and was worried i was not seeing a huge amount of them during the week.\"\nNow the children are older, he says he can pick them up from school as well as drop them off at activities. \"I haven't done anything particularly dramatic with the time, but it's nice to be there day-to-day and talk about what's going on at school.\"\nThe change has also enabled Mr Taylor's partner to work later on a Wednesday, helping her progress at work, as well as make him feel loyal to the firm.\nIt is these sorts of factors that the CBI wants companies to be aware of. Mr Drechsler argues that flexible working should no longer be seen as \"a bonus for staff\", but instead as something that also has clear benefits for employers.\nOther recommendations in the report include:\nThe report said data from earlier this month showing the UK's productivity still lags well behind other major economies meant employing a broader range of people was now more crucial than ever, and would help create more engaged employees.\n\"The economic and social challenges that the UK faces have been thrown into sharp relief by Brexit, in particular around issues like productivity, inclusion and opportunity,\" Mr Drechsler says.\n\"As businesses, it is up to us to seize the opportunities that exist to make some positive changes, becoming firms that will be competitive into the middle of the 21st century. If we get it right, business growth and greater opportunity will go hand in hand.\"\n\nSummary 1:\nThe CBI recommends that employers offer flexible working to attract a broader range of applicants and improve diversity, citing benefits for both employees and businesses.\n\nSummary 2:\n\"I didn't want to be a weekend dad,\" is how Julian Taylor, partner at law firm Simmons and Simmons, explains what drove him to ask for flexible working.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

The SNP look likely to be the swing vote in this particular debate.\nElsewhere, there's a new and multi-faceted crime bill, and in the Lords there's some preliminary sparring over the Trade Union Bill. There may also be votes on the Immigration Bill. But it looks as if the Commons-Lords \"ping-pong\" on the proposals to reform Employment Support Allowance for some disabled people may be petering out.\nHere's my rundown of the week ahead:\nThe Commons opens at 2.30pm for Education questions. As usual any post weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30pm.\nThen it's the launch of the Policing and Crime Bill, a wide-ranging measure which will:\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) after the usual hour of questions to ministers, it's the latest stage of the parliamentary ping-pong over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. After MPs rejected a Lords amendment for the second time, it's rumoured peers may drop their resistance to the Commons over benefits for disabled people in the \"Work Related Activities Group\", and content themselves with a \"regret\" motion. Then peers debate the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and determination of Rates) Regulations 2016 - where the Lib Dems have put down another \"regret motion\" but seem unlikely to attract Labour support.\nAnd that's followed by an International Women's Day debate on the progress of women's representation and empowerment in the UK, 150 years after the 1866 petition for women's suffrage. There are 27 peers down to speak, including two notable maidens - the Conservative Baroness Mone and the Bishop of Gloucester, Rachel Treweek, who will become the first woman Bishop to speak in the Lords.\nThe Commons opens (11.30am) with Justice questions, followed at 12.30pm by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative, Will Quince. He's calling for a first aid component to be added to the driving test, continuing the backbench campaign for more first aid training which recently saw a private member's bill which attempted to require First Aid to be taught in schools.\nHe says this would substantially increase the number of Britons with knowledge of first aid - countries like Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic already require evidence of first aid training as a condition of having a full driving licence. Mr Quince claims the support of the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance.\nAfter that, MPs turn to detailed consideration of the Enterprise Bill - Labour and the Green MP Dr Caroline Lucas both have amendments down on the proposed privatisation of the Green Investment Bank, set up under the Coalition; Labour want to preserve its environmental objectives in the private sector, while Dr Lucas wants buyers to commit themselves to maintaining its existing programme.\nAnd there is a series of amendments on the bill's proposal to cap redundancy payments for public sector workers.\nThere will also be a backbench debate to mark International Women's Day, led by the former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller, now chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - the motion calls for more progress in electing women to Parliament, pay parity between men and women and more action against FGM.\nIn Westminster Hall, the opening debate led by the SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron is on puppy farming and the welfare of young dogs bred for sale (9am-11am).  Then Labour's Jo Cox raises the issue of autism diagnosis waiting times - she says many parents are waiting over two years to get an autism diagnosis for their child and says the families should have a diagnosis within a reasonable timeframe.\nAnd at 2.30pm-4pm, the Conservative Simon Hart will lead a debate on the potential economic benefits of the Swansea Tidal Lagoon - a \u00c2\u00a31bn green energy project, which is one of several such schemes proposed along the south coast of Wales. He will seek to explore the likely impact on the local economy and the number of permanent jobs created in Wales - especially if the Newport and Cardiff Schemes come on line. Early predications refer to a \u00c2\u00a320bn inward investment, nearly 2,000 new jobs and an unquantifiable impact on tourism and leisure.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) there's an International Woman's Day flavour to question time, with questions on: the UN framework preventing violence against women, gender inequality, discriminatory practices and harmful cultural and social norms, from Baroness Kinnock; improving the reading skills of 16 to 24-year-old women, from Baroness Rebuck and on increasing the representation of women in political and public life, from Baroness Gale.\nThen peers turn to the detail of the Housing and Planning Bill - in the fourth day of seven of committee stage - and already the debate is lagging well behind schedule, raising the prospect that the bill might not get to its report stage immediately after Easter, as planned.\nThe sections under scrutiny on Tuesday include right to buy for tenants of housing association properties and high value council property sales. This is the a contentious part of the bill - but, as usual, committee stage debates are preliminary sparring, and no votes are expected; but the debates will foreshadow amendments for report stage, when a serious attempt to re-write these provisions looks likely.\nThere will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry.\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am - for half an hour of questions to the ministers at the Cabinet Office, the government's \"engine room,\" followed, at noon by questions to the prime minister.\nPlaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts has a Ten Minute Rule Bill calling for the law on cyber-crime to be brought together from around 30 different statutes, and for new duties to be imposed on internet service providers and social media companies, to remove offensive material.\nShe has cross party support and this looks very much like the start of a campaign, rather in the tradition of her predecessor, Elfyn Llywd, who scored significant success in toughening up the law on stalking.\nThen MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading.\nLabour will be whipped to back it, the Northern Ireland DUP is on board - but it looks as if the SNP will not be. There's also an amendment from the former Cabinet Minister Caroline Spellman which would allow a limited relaxation in Sunday opening hours for larger shops.\nThe day's Westminster Hall debates cover BT service standards (9.30am-11am); the government's proposals on fixed recoverable costs in clinical negligence claims (11am-11.30am); the contribution of the Scotch whisky industry to the UK economy (2.30pm-4pm); the management of the Health and Safety Executive (4pm- 4.30pm) and competition in the UK energy market (4.30-5.30pm).\nIn the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. Watch out, too, for an amendment from Lords Alton and Forsyth, and Baroness Cox, to guarantee asylum for people fleeing genocide, as defined in the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; and from Lord Dubs, to allow for asylum for people employed by the UK Government in Iraq or Afghanistan.\nThe really big clash over this bill, on unaccompanied child migrants, will come the following week - unless the government makes a pre-emptive concession.\nThere will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee).\nThe Committee suggested a number of fixes which would reduce the impact of the current proposals in the Trade Union Bill - which have been denounced as a partisan attack by the government on Labour.\nThis will be the first chance to debate them and to get a response from ministers. And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. Opposition parties are waiting to see the colour of the minister's money on this issue - but even if the government signs up to the Burns Report compromise, there's still plenty left in this bill to argue about - not insisting on postal ballots and allowing e-voting for union ballots, the \"check-off\" system for deducting union subs from pay-packets, facility time for union reps and much more.\nThe various sides are still circling each other and we could still see a long drawn-out bout of trench warfare when report stage commences.\nThe Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling. He will be under considerable pressure to announce the dates of forthcoming parliamentary recesses, and of the next Queen's Speech. MPs are particularly keen to know whether there will be a recess covering the EU Referendum and whether the the start of the next parliamentary year will be put back until after the referendum, implying a State Opening ceremony in July.\nThen MPs turn to the report stage and third reading of the Northern Ireland (Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan) Bill 2015-16, which implements the latest deal on the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The scheduling implies that the powers that be don't expect any great controversy over this measure, and that the debate will be fairly brief.\nThe decision to end the centuries-old practice of recording Acts of Parliament on vellum - treated cow skin - will be raised in a Backbench Business Committee debate. James Gray, a member of the House of Commons Commission, which signed up to that decision (which came from the Lords) wants to carry on using vellum - and it may all come down to how much it would cost to keep it, and who pays.\nIn the Lords (from 11am) peers debate the detailed provisions on \"pay to stay\" and ending secure tenancies, in the Housing and Planning Bill (see Tuesday, above).\nThere will also be a short debate on the renewal of the BBC's Charter, led by the Liberal Democrat Baroness Bonham-Carter. As I write there are 16 peers are down to speak, which is quite a turnout for a short debate on a Thursday - suggesting there's a considerable level of interest in this issue in the Upper House.\nThe Commons meets (9.30am) to debate private members' bills - I'll list what's down on the Order Paper at the moment, but it's an increasingly inaccurate guide to what actually happens on the day. The main reason for this is that we're now approaching the end of the parliamentary year, where cunning operators like the wily Peter Bone angle to get second reading debate on issues they want to raise - although they then have little prospect of becoming law.\nBut the announcement of the date of the EU referendum has put Mr Bone, one of the prime movers in the increasingly important Grassroots Out organisation, into campaign mode, and he has not been able to be in the Chamber to move some of the many bills he has put down for debate.\nHis close ally, Christopher Chope, has stepped into the breach to move some of those bills - specialising in the ones with an EU dimension. But sadly we're unlikely to get a debate on the Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which would have provided a mechanism, in case the PM was run over by a bus.\nFor the record, the current batting order is:  Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) Bill (Peter Bone); National Health Service Bill (Caroline Lucas); Criminal Cases Review Commission (Supplementary Powers) Bill (Andy McDonald); Regulation of Enforcement Agents (Collection of Council Tax Arrears) Bill (Yvonne Fovargue); Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability) (No. 2) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Family Services) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Scotland Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill (Angus Brendan MacNeil) and the House of Lords (Parliamentary Standards Etc) Bill (Sir Edward Leigh).\nThere are many more bills listed, and if some of those above are not moved, they may even be debated - if their movers are there to do so.\nIt's also private members' bill day in the Lords (10am) where peers will consider the Gambling (Categorisation and Use of B2 Gaming Machines) Bill and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill. More bills may be added to this list.\n\nSummary 1:\nThe UK Parliament is set to debate various bills, including Sunday trading, crime, and employment reform, amidst potential clashes between government and opposition parties.\n\nSummary 2:\nI'm not sure we're quite into \"zombie Parliament\" territory, but there's a distinct lull in Westminster this week, as major events like the Budget and the Investigatory Powers Bill, loom on the horizon.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

The SNP look likely to be the swing vote in this particular debate.\nElsewhere, there's a new and multi-faceted crime bill, and in the Lords there's some preliminary sparring over the Trade Union Bill. There may also be votes on the Immigration Bill. But it looks as if the Commons-Lords \"ping-pong\" on the proposals to reform Employment Support Allowance for some disabled people may be petering out.\nHere's my rundown of the week ahead:\nThe Commons opens at 2.30pm for Education questions. As usual any post weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30pm.\nThen it's the launch of the Policing and Crime Bill, a wide-ranging measure which will:\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) after the usual hour of questions to ministers, it's the latest stage of the parliamentary ping-pong over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. After MPs rejected a Lords amendment for the second time, it's rumoured peers may drop their resistance to the Commons over benefits for disabled people in the \"Work Related Activities Group\", and content themselves with a \"regret\" motion. Then peers debate the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and determination of Rates) Regulations 2016 - where the Lib Dems have put down another \"regret motion\" but seem unlikely to attract Labour support.\nAnd that's followed by an International Women's Day debate on the progress of women's representation and empowerment in the UK, 150 years after the 1866 petition for women's suffrage. There are 27 peers down to speak, including two notable maidens - the Conservative Baroness Mone and the Bishop of Gloucester, Rachel Treweek, who will become the first woman Bishop to speak in the Lords.\nThe Commons opens (11.30am) with Justice questions, followed at 12.30pm by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative, Will Quince. He's calling for a first aid component to be added to the driving test, continuing the backbench campaign for more first aid training which recently saw a private member's bill which attempted to require First Aid to be taught in schools.\nHe says this would substantially increase the number of Britons with knowledge of first aid - countries like Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic already require evidence of first aid training as a condition of having a full driving licence. Mr Quince claims the support of the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance.\nAfter that, MPs turn to detailed consideration of the Enterprise Bill - Labour and the Green MP Dr Caroline Lucas both have amendments down on the proposed privatisation of the Green Investment Bank, set up under the Coalition; Labour want to preserve its environmental objectives in the private sector, while Dr Lucas wants buyers to commit themselves to maintaining its existing programme.\nAnd there is a series of amendments on the bill's proposal to cap redundancy payments for public sector workers.\nThere will also be a backbench debate to mark International Women's Day, led by the former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller, now chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - the motion calls for more progress in electing women to Parliament, pay parity between men and women and more action against FGM.\nIn Westminster Hall, the opening debate led by the SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron is on puppy farming and the welfare of young dogs bred for sale (9am-11am).  Then Labour's Jo Cox raises the issue of autism diagnosis waiting times - she says many parents are waiting over two years to get an autism diagnosis for their child and says the families should have a diagnosis within a reasonable timeframe.\nAnd at 2.30pm-4pm, the Conservative Simon Hart will lead a debate on the potential economic benefits of the Swansea Tidal Lagoon - a \u00c2\u00a31bn green energy project, which is one of several such schemes proposed along the south coast of Wales. He will seek to explore the likely impact on the local economy and the number of permanent jobs created in Wales - especially if the Newport and Cardiff Schemes come on line. Early predications refer to a \u00c2\u00a320bn inward investment, nearly 2,000 new jobs and an unquantifiable impact on tourism and leisure.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) there's an International Woman's Day flavour to question time, with questions on: the UN framework preventing violence against women, gender inequality, discriminatory practices and harmful cultural and social norms, from Baroness Kinnock; improving the reading skills of 16 to 24-year-old women, from Baroness Rebuck and on increasing the representation of women in political and public life, from Baroness Gale.\nThen peers turn to the detail of the Housing and Planning Bill - in the fourth day of seven of committee stage - and already the debate is lagging well behind schedule, raising the prospect that the bill might not get to its report stage immediately after Easter, as planned.\nThe sections under scrutiny on Tuesday include right to buy for tenants of housing association properties and high value council property sales. This is the a contentious part of the bill - but, as usual, committee stage debates are preliminary sparring, and no votes are expected; but the debates will foreshadow amendments for report stage, when a serious attempt to re-write these provisions looks likely.\nThere will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry.\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am - for half an hour of questions to the ministers at the Cabinet Office, the government's \"engine room,\" followed, at noon by questions to the prime minister.\nPlaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts has a Ten Minute Rule Bill calling for the law on cyber-crime to be brought together from around 30 different statutes, and for new duties to be imposed on internet service providers and social media companies, to remove offensive material.\nShe has cross party support and this looks very much like the start of a campaign, rather in the tradition of her predecessor, Elfyn Llywd, who scored significant success in toughening up the law on stalking.\nThen MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading.\nLabour will be whipped to back it, the Northern Ireland DUP is on board - but it looks as if the SNP will not be. There's also an amendment from the former Cabinet Minister Caroline Spellman which would allow a limited relaxation in Sunday opening hours for larger shops.\nThe day's Westminster Hall debates cover BT service standards (9.30am-11am); the government's proposals on fixed recoverable costs in clinical negligence claims (11am-11.30am); the contribution of the Scotch whisky industry to the UK economy (2.30pm-4pm); the management of the Health and Safety Executive (4pm- 4.30pm) and competition in the UK energy market (4.30-5.30pm).\nIn the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. Watch out, too, for an amendment from Lords Alton and Forsyth, and Baroness Cox, to guarantee asylum for people fleeing genocide, as defined in the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; and from Lord Dubs, to allow for asylum for people employed by the UK Government in Iraq or Afghanistan.\nThe really big clash over this bill, on unaccompanied child migrants, will come the following week - unless the government makes a pre-emptive concession.\nThere will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee).\nThe Committee suggested a number of fixes which would reduce the impact of the current proposals in the Trade Union Bill - which have been denounced as a partisan attack by the government on Labour.\nThis will be the first chance to debate them and to get a response from ministers. And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. Opposition parties are waiting to see the colour of the minister's money on this issue - but even if the government signs up to the Burns Report compromise, there's still plenty left in this bill to argue about - not insisting on postal ballots and allowing e-voting for union ballots, the \"check-off\" system for deducting union subs from pay-packets, facility time for union reps and much more.\nThe various sides are still circling each other and we could still see a long drawn-out bout of trench warfare when report stage commences.\nThe Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling. He will be under considerable pressure to announce the dates of forthcoming parliamentary recesses, and of the next Queen's Speech. MPs are particularly keen to know whether there will be a recess covering the EU Referendum and whether the the start of the next parliamentary year will be put back until after the referendum, implying a State Opening ceremony in July.\nThen MPs turn to the report stage and third reading of the Northern Ireland (Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan) Bill 2015-16, which implements the latest deal on the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The scheduling implies that the powers that be don't expect any great controversy over this measure, and that the debate will be fairly brief.\nThe decision to end the centuries-old practice of recording Acts of Parliament on vellum - treated cow skin - will be raised in a Backbench Business Committee debate. James Gray, a member of the House of Commons Commission, which signed up to that decision (which came from the Lords) wants to carry on using vellum - and it may all come down to how much it would cost to keep it, and who pays.\nIn the Lords (from 11am) peers debate the detailed provisions on \"pay to stay\" and ending secure tenancies, in the Housing and Planning Bill (see Tuesday, above).\nThere will also be a short debate on the renewal of the BBC's Charter, led by the Liberal Democrat Baroness Bonham-Carter. As I write there are 16 peers are down to speak, which is quite a turnout for a short debate on a Thursday - suggesting there's a considerable level of interest in this issue in the Upper House.\nThe Commons meets (9.30am) to debate private members' bills - I'll list what's down on the Order Paper at the moment, but it's an increasingly inaccurate guide to what actually happens on the day. The main reason for this is that we're now approaching the end of the parliamentary year, where cunning operators like the wily Peter Bone angle to get second reading debate on issues they want to raise - although they then have little prospect of becoming law.\nBut the announcement of the date of the EU referendum has put Mr Bone, one of the prime movers in the increasingly important Grassroots Out organisation, into campaign mode, and he has not been able to be in the Chamber to move some of the many bills he has put down for debate.\nHis close ally, Christopher Chope, has stepped into the breach to move some of those bills - specialising in the ones with an EU dimension. But sadly we're unlikely to get a debate on the Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which would have provided a mechanism, in case the PM was run over by a bus.\nFor the record, the current batting order is:  Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) Bill (Peter Bone); National Health Service Bill (Caroline Lucas); Criminal Cases Review Commission (Supplementary Powers) Bill (Andy McDonald); Regulation of Enforcement Agents (Collection of Council Tax Arrears) Bill (Yvonne Fovargue); Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability) (No. 2) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Family Services) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Scotland Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill (Angus Brendan MacNeil) and the House of Lords (Parliamentary Standards Etc) Bill (Sir Edward Leigh).\nThere are many more bills listed, and if some of those above are not moved, they may even be debated - if their movers are there to do so.\nIt's also private members' bill day in the Lords (10am) where peers will consider the Gambling (Categorisation and Use of B2 Gaming Machines) Bill and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill. More bills may be added to this list.\n\nSummary 1:\nThe UK Parliament is set to debate various bills, including Sunday trading, crime, and employment reform, amidst potential clashes between government and opposition parties.\n\nSummary 2:\nI'm not sure we're quite into \"zombie Parliament\" territory, but there's a distinct lull in Westminster this week, as major events like the Budget and the Investigatory Powers Bill, loom on the horizon.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

That's the usual sequence of events.\nBut today the independent reviewer was criticising the process before the new Counter-Terror and Security Bill was published.\nThe QC used his customary polite, sometimes understated, tone - but this was a criticism of politicians whom he said hadn't fully thought through some of the proposals announced in early September.\nRead more from Robin\nMrs May's new measures to tackle terrorism come days after she said the UK faces a \"greater\" terror threat than ever before.\nThe measures include requiring airlines to pass on details of their passengers and changes to the way TPIMs - Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - work to monitor terror suspects who cannot be prosecuted.\nBut campaigners have condemned it, saying it threatens civil liberties.\n'A more sensible way'\nMr Anderson - appointed by the government to be its independent reviewer of terrorism legislation - said the new anti-terror legislation was \"nothing like as dramatic\" as David Cameron had proposed earlier this year.\nHe told the Joint Committee on Human Rights the original plan to block suspected British jihadists returning from Iraq and Syria as \"an announcement waiting for a policy\".\nBut he said it soon became clear such a move would \"neither legally or practically\" work and the current plan was now much \"closer to managed return\".\nHe argued there could be \"a more sensible\" way of dealing with some people suspected of being involved in terrorist activities.\n\"One could look at it in terms of young, possibly vulnerable people caught up with the wrong crowd in Syria - didn't really know exactly what they were doing,\" he said.\n\"Do you want to throw the book at them straight away in terms of arrest and charge? Or is there something to be said, even though you do suspect them of having fought, of keeping them under a very light regime where they might have to report daily to a police station?\nThe new Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill includes:\n\"They might have to notify their residence; they might have to go along to meetings with probation or with some similar which perhaps might be for some people be a more sensible way of dealing with them than putting them straight into the criminal justice process.\"\nMr Anderson said the use of exclusion orders would require the cooperation of carriers, such as airlines and of states where these people might find themselves.\n\"But certainly presented with an order at the check-in desk, the person might say: 'I want to come home,' or decide not to come home,\" he said.\n\"The concern I have about this power and the central concern about it is: where are the courts in all of this?\n\"If the home secretary wants to impose a TPIM she has to go to the court first and if the court says she's got it wrong, it will say so.\n\"One will want to look very carefully to see if this is a power that requires the intervention of the court at any stage, or whether it's simply envisaged as something the home secretary imposes.\n\"If one is abroad when this order is served on you, then it's a little difficult to see in practical terms how a right to judicial review could be exercised.\"\nMr Anderson spoke out as a week-long counter-terrorism awareness campaign enters its third day.\n'Changing threats'\nThe UK's terror threat level remains \"severe\" after it was upped from \"substantial\" earlier this year in response to conflicts in Iraq and Syria.\nSpeaking ahead of the bill's publication, Mrs May said: \"We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a deadly terrorist ideology.

That's the usual sequence of events.\nBut today the independent reviewer was criticising the process before the new Counter-Terror and Security Bill was published.\nThe QC used his customary polite, sometimes understated, tone - but this was a criticism of politicians whom he said hadn't fully thought through some of the proposals announced in early September.\nRead more from Robin\nMrs May's new measures to tackle terrorism come days after she said the UK faces a \"greater\" terror threat than ever before.\nThe measures include requiring airlines to pass on details of their passengers and changes to the way TPIMs - Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - work to monitor terror suspects who cannot be prosecuted.\nBut campaigners have condemned it, saying it threatens civil liberties.\n'A more sensible way'\nMr Anderson - appointed by the government to be its independent reviewer of terrorism legislation - said the new anti-terror legislation was \"nothing like as dramatic\" as David Cameron had proposed earlier this year.\nHe told the Joint Committee on Human Rights the original plan to block suspected British jihadists returning from Iraq and Syria as \"an announcement waiting for a policy\".\nBut he said it soon became clear such a move would \"neither legally or practically\" work and the current plan was now much \"closer to managed return\".\nHe argued there could be \"a more sensible\" way of dealing with some people suspected of being involved in terrorist activities.\n\"One could look at it in terms of young, possibly vulnerable people caught up with the wrong crowd in Syria - didn't really know exactly what they were doing,\" he said.\n\"Do you want to throw the book at them straight away in terms of arrest and charge? Or is there something to be said, even though you do suspect them of having fought, of keeping them under a very light regime where they might have to report daily to a police station?\nThe new Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill includes:\n\"They might have to notify their residence; they might have to go along to meetings with probation or with some similar which perhaps might be for some people be a more sensible way of dealing with them than putting them straight into the criminal justice process.\"\nMr Anderson said the use of exclusion orders would require the cooperation of carriers, such as airlines and of states where these people might find themselves.\n\"But certainly presented with an order at the check-in desk, the person might say: 'I want to come home,' or decide not to come home,\" he said.\n\"The concern I have about this power and the central concern about it is: where are the courts in all of this?\n\"If the home secretary wants to impose a TPIM she has to go to the court first and if the court says she's got it wrong, it will say so.\n\"One will want to look very carefully to see if this is a power that requires the intervention of the court at any stage, or whether it's simply envisaged as something the home secretary imposes.\n\"If one is abroad when this order is served on you, then it's a little difficult to see in practical terms how a right to judicial review could be exercised.\"\nMr Anderson spoke out as a week-long counter-terrorism awareness campaign enters its third day.\n'Changing threats'\nThe UK's terror threat level remains \"severe\" after it was upped from \"substantial\" earlier this year in response to conflicts in Iraq and Syria.\nSpeaking ahead of the bill's publication, Mrs May said: \"We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a deadly terrorist ideology. These powers are essential to keep up with the very serious and rapidly changing threats we face.\n\"This bill includes a considered, targeted set of proposals that will help to keep us safe at a time of very significant danger by ensuring we have the powers we need to defend ourselves.\"\nThe government wants to \"fast-track\" the bill through Parliament, citing the need to tackle the direct threat posed by the group calling itself Islamic State (IS) and the increasing number of Britons travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight on its behalf.\nBut shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said more was needed to be done to stop British citizens from being radicalised and to deal with any threat this posed to national security.\nAmnesty International called the powers \"draconian\", adding none of the measures seemed \"properly thought through\".\nAnd Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, said: \"Yet again, politicians resort to high talk and rushed legislation in an attempt to look tough in the face of terrorism.

He turned 38 a month before the first battle of Passchendaele and saw action in the Boesinghe sector in Poelcapelle.\nBefore he fought in the battle, he was one of just 200 men who survived the first Battle of Ypres in 1914. After the war, he didn't speak of his time in the army.\nSam Barnett's also posted about his great-grandfather, Private Maurice Walter Barnett, who was killed in the opening attack of the battle on 31 July 1917.\nPrivate Barnett served in the 12th Battalion Royal Sussex Regiment after a spell at the 9th Battalion. \"It is hard to imagine what he went through, surviving Boar's Head and the Battle of the Somme,\" said Sam.\n\"It's easy for us to think of the casualties as just numbers of soldiers but, to Walter, they would have been his local shopkeepers, neighbours, and friends.\"\nRussell Craig tweeted an image in remembrance of his great uncle, Private James Kelly, who was killed in the battle on 16 August 1917.\nKelly was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1897. He attempted to sign up for service with local military units, but he was rejected so he went to Randalstown in Ireland to enlist with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers.\nHis body was never recovered. His name is commemorated in Tyne Cot Cemetery alongside 35,000 other missing soldiers.\nPaul Brown shared the story of his great-grandfather, Richardson Robson Flinn. He served with the Northumberland Fusiliers Labour Corps in 1914, then aged 22.\nHe was gassed during fighting in 1915 and recuperated in Britain before going back to the frontline at Passchendaele.\n\"Richardson made it almost to the German lines before being felled by gunfire, and lay wounded in a shell hole,\" said Paul.\n\"Once the initial chaos had subsided, German officers emerged waving red cross flags. One German gave Richardson some water from his canteen. Eventually, the wounded from both sides were evacuated.\n\"Richardson was discharged in December 1917 with a disability shot wound, although it was the gas that had done the worst damage.\n\"He returned home, but never fully recovered his health, and died young.

He turned 38 a month before the first battle of Passchendaele and saw action in the Boesinghe sector in Poelcapelle.\nBefore he fought in the battle, he was one of just 200 men who survived the first Battle of Ypres in 1914. After the war, he didn't speak of his time in the army.\nSam Barnett's also posted about his great-grandfather, Private Maurice Walter Barnett, who was killed in the opening attack of the battle on 31 July 1917.\nPrivate Barnett served in the 12th Battalion Royal Sussex Regiment after a spell at the 9th Battalion. \"It is hard to imagine what he went through, surviving Boar's Head and the Battle of the Somme,\" said Sam.\n\"It's easy for us to think of the casualties as just numbers of soldiers but, to Walter, they would have been his local shopkeepers, neighbours, and friends.\"\nRussell Craig tweeted an image in remembrance of his great uncle, Private James Kelly, who was killed in the battle on 16 August 1917.\nKelly was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1897. He attempted to sign up for service with local military units, but he was rejected so he went to Randalstown in Ireland to enlist with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers.\nHis body was never recovered. His name is commemorated in Tyne Cot Cemetery alongside 35,000 other missing soldiers.\nPaul Brown shared the story of his great-grandfather, Richardson Robson Flinn. He served with the Northumberland Fusiliers Labour Corps in 1914, then aged 22.\nHe was gassed during fighting in 1915 and recuperated in Britain before going back to the frontline at Passchendaele.\n\"Richardson made it almost to the German lines before being felled by gunfire, and lay wounded in a shell hole,\" said Paul.\n\"Once the initial chaos had subsided, German officers emerged waving red cross flags. One German gave Richardson some water from his canteen. Eventually, the wounded from both sides were evacuated.\n\"Richardson was discharged in December 1917 with a disability shot wound, although it was the gas that had done the worst damage.\n\"He returned home, but never fully recovered his health, and died young. Unfortunately, none of his living relatives ever got the chance to know him.\"\nTwitter user @DaveVForce shared his memory of his distant cousin who was killed in the battle.\nGunner William Potterton enlisted for service on 11 July 1916 and served with the 72nd battery Royal Field Artillery.\nHe was killed in action on 19 October 1917.

You feel the pressure and you respond to it. You impose yourself upon rivals through physical dominance and force of personality.\nIn a sport like rugby union, where players have never been bigger, faster, or hit harder for longer, might is right like never before. Which makes the continual influence of Dan Carter not just illogical but something close to miraculous.\nOn Saturday evening in Lyon, Carter - the leading points scorer in Test history, reigning World Rugby player of the year, World Cup winner for a second time seven months ago - will, in characteristically undemonstrative fashion, lead Racing 92's charge as they take on Saracens in the Champions Cup final.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe All Blacks great is not only a physical throw-back in a game increasingly for the outsized and enormous. At 5ft 10in and 14 stone, the 34-year-old plays an old-fashioned way: finding space where others seek contact, appearing unhurried when fly-halves have never had less time, still managing to play on instinct when set moves and patterns are everywhere you look.\nIt's not that Carter doesn't do the nasty stuff. In Racing's semi-final win over Leicester Tigers he made 16 tackles.\nIt's how he does it. Whereas Jonny Wilkinson, the original big-hitting number 10, stopped opposition runners like a rogue flanker and brought gasps from the stands and lungs of the victim alike, Carter tackles like he does everything else - with economy rather than anger, with perfect yet undemonstrative technique, with efficiency over ostentation.\nCarter is not quite the player he was. The outside break and sudden acceleration that defined so many of his early masterclasses have quietly been lost to the years. It doesn't really matter. In his swansong he appears to worry less about what he lacks than utilise what he does.\nIf it wasn't the sort of thing that in his home town of Southbridge would trigger disbelief - expressed, because this is the South Island of New Zealand, by something as flamboyant as a raised eyebrow or muted cough - you'd say it was all rather Zen: the impossible calm in a sporting storm, the balance between self and team, equanimity in even the biggest occasions.\nThere is the ritual of his relentless kicking practice, whether at the posts that his father put up next to the family home or on the foreign fields of France; the meditation brought about by those repeated simple actions; the carefully constructed humility of an All Blacks environment where 100-cap heroes like Carter and retired captain Richie McCaw were expected to clean up the dressing room like backroom juniors.\nAnd it is all done in the most unobtrusive way. Wilkinson kicked from the tee with such exaggerated movements that half-cut punters in pubs could do impressions. Dan Biggar has his little soft-shoe shuffle, the 'Biggarena'. Owen Farrell, Carter's opposite number on Saturday, has the laser eyes and robotic head-turn.\nCarter? Even after so many penalties and conversions, it's still hard to remember exactly how he looks in sweet motion. The fact that he has been the same with ball in hand - perfectly timed passes or offloads, but all done in the most discreet and understated way - have sometimes made it hard for people to understand what has made him so special. He doesn't always stand out, so how can he be outstanding?\n\"He's fascinating,\" admits Ronan O'Gara, arguably Ireland's finest fly-half and now, in early retirement, assistant coach at Carter's Racing.\n\"He's just extremely humble, extremely respectful. He smiles, he always finds a way of getting the job done.\n\"He doesn't stress, he's always polite, he's a breath of fresh air. You can learn an awful lot by just watching him.\"\nCarter isn't the only sporting great who can appear to be operating in slow-motion and fast-forward at the same time, but he maintains that composure longer than most.\nTennis' Roger Federer at his best was both unhurried and unflustered, but at the moment of victory all that held-back emotion would come crashing out. In cricket, Chris Gayle remains expressionless when thrashing unfortunate bowlers for six after six, but will dance with his top off when victory has been won.\nLionel Messi, for all the gossamer touches with that left foot, is all beautiful bustle and obvious energy, Cristiano Ronaldo all strut and preen on the football pitch.\nEven Tiger Woods, who before his fall could hold his form and nerve in the final-round meltdown like no other golfer, would spit and cuss his way round the course when the mojo left his side.\nCarter, in the biggest moments he has faced, has looked as perturbed as if he were back at Christchurch Boys' High School, from the second Test against the Lions in 2005, when he turned in a performance that led to him being described as \"the perfect 10\", all the way through to last October's World Cup final.\nAgainst the Wallabies at Twickenham that day, there was a moment to epitomise so much of what had come before: the All Blacks suddenly under huge pressure, their 17-point lead cut to just four with 15 minutes to go.\nIn his first 110 Tests Carter had landed a total of just six drop-goals. A week after adding another to put away South Africa in the semi-finals, he took a pass flat with the defence charging, his feet and eyes set for the short pass to Sonny Bill Williams on his outside shoulder.\nForty metres out, the game's greatest prize in the balance, chaos all around. Not for Carter. Instead, a little pocket of space and tranquillity and time where no-one else could see it, a turn of the shoulders and hips, a perfect contact with his left boot to send the ball arcing between the sticks.\nWilkinson was also touched by Eastern philosophy, first by Buddhism as cruel injuries kept keeping him out, later by a Japanese school of thought called Kaizen.\nBecause of the man that Wilkinson is, that was more about a tortured form of self-improvement. \"You imagine being watched by a video 24/7 to help you get better each day and make good decisions,\" he has said.\nFor Farrell, who shares much of Wilkinson's dedication, Saturday is also about a particular kind of personal development.\nAfter his yellow card in the critical World Cup group match against Australia and the two-week ban for a dangerous tackle after Saracens' Champions Cup semi-final win over Wasps, he will be watching Carter not just to keep his influence in check but to learn from the old master too.\n\"It's just how calm he is, how much he is in control of what he does that stands out,\" the fiery Farrell says.\n\"Trying to be calmer on the pitch, it's definitely something I'm always trying to do.

One of the summaries was written by you, and one was not, and I want you to tell me which one you think you wrote. The prompt given to the summary writer was: \"Provide a one-sentence summary (no more than 30 words) with no other text.\". Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nYou try harder, you do better. You feel the pressure and you respond to it. You impose yourself upon rivals through physical dominance and force of personality.\nIn a sport like rugby union, where players have never been bigger, faster, or hit harder for longer, might is right like never before. Which makes the continual influence of Dan Carter not just illogical but something close to miraculous.\nOn Saturday evening in Lyon, Carter - the leading points scorer in Test history, reigning World Rugby player of the year, World Cup winner for a second time seven months ago - will, in characteristically undemonstrative fashion, lead Racing 92's charge as they take on Saracens in the Champions Cup final.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe All Blacks great is not only a physical throw-back in a game increasingly for the outsized and enormous. At 5ft 10in and 14 stone, the 34-year-old plays an old-fashioned way: finding space where others seek contact, appearing unhurried when fly-halves have never had less time, still managing to play on instinct when set moves and patterns are everywhere you look.\nIt's not that Carter doesn't do the nasty stuff. In Racing's semi-final win over Leicester Tigers he made 16 tackles.\nIt's how he does it. Whereas Jonny Wilkinson, the original big-hitting number 10, stopped opposition runners like a rogue flanker and brought gasps from the stands and lungs of the victim alike, Carter tackles like he does everything else - with economy rather than anger, with perfect yet undemonstrative technique, with efficiency over ostentation.\nCarter is not quite the player he was. The outside break and sudden acceleration that defined so many of his early masterclasses have quietly been lost to the years. It doesn't really matter. In his swansong he appears to worry less about what he lacks than utilise what he does.\nIf it wasn't the sort of thing that in his home town of Southbridge would trigger disbelief - expressed, because this is the South Island of New Zealand, by something as flamboyant as a raised eyebrow or muted cough - you'd say it was all rather Zen: the impossible calm in a sporting storm, the balance between self and team, equanimity in even the biggest occasions.\nThere is the ritual of his relentless kicking practice, whether at the posts that his father put up next to the family home or on the foreign fields of France; the meditation brought about by those repeated simple actions; the carefully constructed humility of an All Blacks environment where 100-cap heroes like Carter and retired captain Richie McCaw were expected to clean up the dressing room like backroom juniors.\nAnd it is all done in the most unobtrusive way. Wilkinson kicked from the tee with such exaggerated movements that half-cut punters in pubs could do impressions. Dan Biggar has his little soft-shoe shuffle, the 'Biggarena'. Owen Farrell, Carter's opposite number on Saturday, has the laser eyes and robotic head-turn.\nCarter? Even after so many penalties and conversions, it's still hard to remember exactly how he looks in sweet motion. The fact that he has been the same with ball in hand - perfectly timed passes or offloads, but all done in the most discreet and understated way - have sometimes made it hard for people to understand what has made him so special. He doesn't always stand out, so how can he be outstanding?\n\"He's fascinating,\" admits Ronan O'Gara, arguably Ireland's finest fly-half and now, in early retirement, assistant coach at Carter's Racing.\n\"He's just extremely humble, extremely respectful. He smiles, he always finds a way of getting the job done.\n\"He doesn't stress, he's always polite, he's a breath of fresh air. You can learn an awful lot by just watching him.\"\nCarter isn't the only sporting great who can appear to be operating in slow-motion and fast-forward at the same time, but he maintains that composure longer than most.\nTennis' Roger Federer at his best was both unhurried and unflustered, but at the moment of victory all that held-back emotion would come crashing out. In cricket, Chris Gayle remains expressionless when thrashing unfortunate bowlers for six after six, but will dance with his top off when victory has been won.\nLionel Messi, for all the gossamer touches with that left foot, is all beautiful bustle and obvious energy, Cristiano Ronaldo all strut and preen on the football pitch.\nEven Tiger Woods, who before his fall could hold his form and nerve in the final-round meltdown like no other golfer, would spit and cuss his way round the course when the mojo left his side.\nCarter, in the biggest moments he has faced, has looked as perturbed as if he were back at Christchurch Boys' High School, from the second Test against the Lions in 2005, when he turned in a performance that led to him being described as \"the perfect 10\", all the way through to last October's World Cup final.\nAgainst the Wallabies at Twickenham that day, there was a moment to epitomise so much of what had come before: the All Blacks suddenly under huge pressure, their 17-point lead cut to just four with 15 minutes to go.\nIn his first 110 Tests Carter had landed a total of just six drop-goals. A week after adding another to put away South Africa in the semi-finals, he took a pass flat with the defence charging, his feet and eyes set for the short pass to Sonny Bill Williams on his outside shoulder.\nForty metres out, the game's greatest prize in the balance, chaos all around. Not for Carter. Instead, a little pocket of space and tranquillity and time where no-one else could see it, a turn of the shoulders and hips, a perfect contact with his left boot to send the ball arcing between the sticks.\nWilkinson was also touched by Eastern philosophy, first by Buddhism as cruel injuries kept keeping him out, later by a Japanese school of thought called Kaizen.\nBecause of the man that Wilkinson is, that was more about a tortured form of self-improvement. \"You imagine being watched by a video 24/7 to help you get better each day and make good decisions,\" he has said.\nFor Farrell, who shares much of Wilkinson's dedication, Saturday is also about a particular kind of personal development.\nAfter his yellow card in the critical World Cup group match against Australia and the two-week ban for a dangerous tackle after Saracens' Champions Cup semi-final win over Wasps, he will be watching Carter not just to keep his influence in check but to learn from the old master too.\n\"It's just how calm he is, how much he is in control of what he does that stands out,\" the fiery Farrell says.\n\"Trying to be calmer on the pitch, it's definitely something I'm always trying to do. The more you're calm, the more you're in control and the more you're thinking about the right things.\"\nCarter in control. The career moves on, but the philosophy remains the same.\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.\n\nSummary 1:\nDan Carter, the leading points scorer in Test history, will lead Racing 92 in the Champions Cup final, showcasing his unique blend of physical dominance and calm, understated leadership.\n\nSummary 2:\nSport at the elite level, even for those few geniuses who can routinely do what others can only dream of, typically appears to be about obvious effort and relentless industry.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

I really want to get a good jump in the first round.\n\"This is my first big competition especially after a knee operation last autumn so I just want 6,200 points and to be injury free and to be going home with my ticket for the Olympics.\"\nThe Briton has also said her experience in Beijing changed her, created a \"new Kat\" who is determined to bounce back and quash her demons.\nHer performances on the opening day in Austria promised much not only for this competition but the summer ahead.\nAlthough she has repeatedly said Olympic qualification rather than regaining the title she won in 2014 is her priority this weekend, she looks set to vie with favourite Theisen-Eaton for first place.\nAnd despite a poor display in the shot, her weakest event, Johnson-Thompson will take heart that she achieved her best heptathlon score of 6682 points in Gotzis two years ago, when her total after the opening day was also 3923.\nThe long jump, javelin and 800m remain on Sunday but fellow Brit Morgan Lake - adrift of her personal bests in all four events on the first day - is likely to fall short of the total needed for Rio.\nLake - recording 14.43 secs in the 100m hurdles, 1.86m in the high jump, 13.18m in the shot put and 26.12 secs in the 200m - is 29th overall.\nBritish decathletes John Lane (4159 points) and Ashley Bryant (4121 points) are ninth and 13th respectively at the halfway stage in Austria, with the pair needing 8100 points to be selected for the Olympics.\n\nSummary 1:\nBritish athlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson aims to qualify for the Olympics with a 6,200-point total in the heptathlon, currently second with 3,932 points, 40 behind leader Brianne Theisen-Eaton.\n\nSummary 2:\nBritain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson is on course to qualify for this summer's Rio Olympics after setting three personal bests on the opening day of the Hypo meeting in Gotzis.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

My friends have been proud of me and enjoyed watching me. Now it's back to blazers and ties.\n\"No-one likes school really. When I'm there I just can't wait to get into the snooker hall.\"\nLuckily for Page, his teachers recognise his potential and are happy for him to forego as many lessons as is necessary for him to pursue his snooker ambitions.\nAfter a week in school, Page will travel to Cyprus for the European Championships, where winning the under-21 or senior competition would give him the opportunity to turn professional.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWith Page in Cyprus will be his mother Clare, who along with father Andrew, has been integral to his snooker development.\nBeing the parents of a budding player has meant driving him from school to the local snooker hall every day, then for a whole day of practice on Saturdays and usually a tournament on Sundays - of which Page enters about 33 a year.\n\"We're so proud, we just can't believe it,\" says Clare.\n\"We came down here with no expectation. He did, he had expectation because he's got all the confidence in the world.\n\"We were just thinking we've got a couple of days off work, we'll come down with him, and my head was mostly down because I couldn't watch.\"\nAndrew was the first person Jackson saw as he left the table after his first and second-round wins, and he begins to well up as he reflects on his son's achievement.\n\"It's emotional. Even seeing him walk out on the big stage, you get a lump in your throat,\" says Andrew, his eyes glistening as he struggles to restrain his tears.\n\"When that last black went in - I don't know if it was the first round or the second, I can't remember - I was the first one out of there, before anyone could see me crying.\"\nThe pride, warmth and sheer enthusiasm with which Page's parents speak is infectious. They joke that it is just as well they have only one son - as they would simply not have the time to support another child as lovingly or committedly.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPage, while equally amenable and friendly, is more reserved. His is a temperament made for professional sport.\nPerhaps it is a quality he has gleaned from two-time world champion Mark Williams, who is from Cwm - just a couple of miles away from Ebbw Vale - and has been helping Page train.\n\"He's very laid back, which is a good trait to have,\" Page says. \"I've played with Mark on the practice tables a few times. You learn off him and get tips off him.\"\nWilliams, a former world number one with 18 ranking titles and about \u00a35m in prize money to his name, will be a valuable influence as Page aims to establish himself.\nThe financial rewards for leading snooker players can be great and, this week, Page got a taste of things which might be to come.\nReaching the third round of the Welsh Open earned him \u00a33,500 - a far cry from the pocket money or paper rounds with which most 15-year-olds have to make do.\nTrue to form, the measured Page plans to put the majority of that sum in the bank. Surely, though, after such a remarkable week, he can afford himself a little treat?\nHe ponders his options, smiles and says: \"I might get a McDonalds later.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFormer world champion Terry Griffiths\n\"When I saw Jackson play, it reminded me of when I was 15 years of age and how I thought about playing. He just loves to be there.\n\"He takes on shots that other people turn down because he's excited at that age and to win two matches as he has done is exceptional.\n\"He's a tremendous potter, he's got no fear at all.\"\nFormer world champion Mark Williams\n\"He's played a few pros already and beaten them. I didn't do that when I was 15. What he is doing is incredible.\n\"He is a very fast player, he will slow down when he's older, but he is only 15. He keeps winning under-21 tournaments, so he doesn't need to change too much.\"\nDeputy phase director of Ebbw Fawr Learning Community, Paul Freeguard\n\"We are very, very proud of his achievement, but not surprised, as he is an under-18 world champion.\n\"The other pupils are following the tournament, they are all avid fans now.

My friends have been proud of me and enjoyed watching me. Now it's back to blazers and ties.\n\"No-one likes school really. When I'm there I just can't wait to get into the snooker hall.\"\nLuckily for Page, his teachers recognise his potential and are happy for him to forego as many lessons as is necessary for him to pursue his snooker ambitions.\nAfter a week in school, Page will travel to Cyprus for the European Championships, where winning the under-21 or senior competition would give him the opportunity to turn professional.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWith Page in Cyprus will be his mother Clare, who along with father Andrew, has been integral to his snooker development.\nBeing the parents of a budding player has meant driving him from school to the local snooker hall every day, then for a whole day of practice on Saturdays and usually a tournament on Sundays - of which Page enters about 33 a year.\n\"We're so proud, we just can't believe it,\" says Clare.\n\"We came down here with no expectation. He did, he had expectation because he's got all the confidence in the world.\n\"We were just thinking we've got a couple of days off work, we'll come down with him, and my head was mostly down because I couldn't watch.\"\nAndrew was the first person Jackson saw as he left the table after his first and second-round wins, and he begins to well up as he reflects on his son's achievement.\n\"It's emotional. Even seeing him walk out on the big stage, you get a lump in your throat,\" says Andrew, his eyes glistening as he struggles to restrain his tears.\n\"When that last black went in - I don't know if it was the first round or the second, I can't remember - I was the first one out of there, before anyone could see me crying.\"\nThe pride, warmth and sheer enthusiasm with which Page's parents speak is infectious. They joke that it is just as well they have only one son - as they would simply not have the time to support another child as lovingly or committedly.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPage, while equally amenable and friendly, is more reserved. His is a temperament made for professional sport.\nPerhaps it is a quality he has gleaned from two-time world champion Mark Williams, who is from Cwm - just a couple of miles away from Ebbw Vale - and has been helping Page train.\n\"He's very laid back, which is a good trait to have,\" Page says. \"I've played with Mark on the practice tables a few times. You learn off him and get tips off him.\"\nWilliams, a former world number one with 18 ranking titles and about \u00a35m in prize money to his name, will be a valuable influence as Page aims to establish himself.\nThe financial rewards for leading snooker players can be great and, this week, Page got a taste of things which might be to come.\nReaching the third round of the Welsh Open earned him \u00a33,500 - a far cry from the pocket money or paper rounds with which most 15-year-olds have to make do.\nTrue to form, the measured Page plans to put the majority of that sum in the bank. Surely, though, after such a remarkable week, he can afford himself a little treat?\nHe ponders his options, smiles and says: \"I might get a McDonalds later.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFormer world champion Terry Griffiths\n\"When I saw Jackson play, it reminded me of when I was 15 years of age and how I thought about playing. He just loves to be there.\n\"He takes on shots that other people turn down because he's excited at that age and to win two matches as he has done is exceptional.\n\"He's a tremendous potter, he's got no fear at all.\"\nFormer world champion Mark Williams\n\"He's played a few pros already and beaten them. I didn't do that when I was 15. What he is doing is incredible.\n\"He is a very fast player, he will slow down when he's older, but he is only 15. He keeps winning under-21 tournaments, so he doesn't need to change too much.\"\nDeputy phase director of Ebbw Fawr Learning Community, Paul Freeguard\n\"We are very, very proud of his achievement, but not surprised, as he is an under-18 world champion.\n\"The other pupils are following the tournament, they are all avid fans now. They are getting time to catch up and watch him.\n\"He will have exams when he comes back, same as everyone else, so he will be expected to catch up on the work he has missed.\n\"Jackson will make a professional career out of snooker so it would be unfair if we hadn't supported him. But I couldn't tell you why he doesn't like history or English, but luckily he's doing well in those subjects.\n\"He will get a hero's welcome when he returns to the school.\"\n\nSummary 1:\nAs excuses for missing school go, playing in the third round of a ranking tournament against the world's fourth best snooker player is a pretty good one.\n\nSummary 2:\nFifteen-year-old Jackson Page's impressive run at the Welsh Open came to an end with a 4-0 loss to Judd Trump, but he remains optimistic about his snooker ambitions.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

Before the break, the home side looked sluggish and were outworked by a dynamic away side.\nThey did produce a couple of chances - the best of them a Yaya Toure header from eight yards that was palmed away by Howard - but could easily have trailed.\nThey improved in the second half as Sergio Aguero became more involved, but still struggled to break their opponents down, even after the introduction of David Silva with 15 minutes to go.\nThe game would end in desperate, vain calls for a penalty for Stones' admittedly risky sliding challenge on Sterling.\nCity boss Manuel Pellegrini was adamant that Stones' challenge should have been penalised and his side awarded a \"clear penalty\".\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"Everyone in the stadium could see it was a penalty - it was so near to the referee and so clear,\" said the Chilean. \"Both Raheem's legs were taken by Stones but if he doesn't whistle we can't say anything.\"\nUnsurprisingly, Everton boss Roberto Martinez had an opposing view of the incident and praised the \"maturity\" of referee Roger East.\n\"We have been on the back end of receiving a penalty, in the last seconds against Stoke,\" said the Spaniard.\n\"Stones goes to slide to block the ball, Sterling does not play the ball and waited. In my eyes it is an area that is not certain if it's a penalty or not.\n\"I believe the referees should control their emotions and the referee did exactly that.

Before the break, the home side looked sluggish and were outworked by a dynamic away side.\nThey did produce a couple of chances - the best of them a Yaya Toure header from eight yards that was palmed away by Howard - but could easily have trailed.\nThey improved in the second half as Sergio Aguero became more involved, but still struggled to break their opponents down, even after the introduction of David Silva with 15 minutes to go.\nThe game would end in desperate, vain calls for a penalty for Stones' admittedly risky sliding challenge on Sterling.\nCity boss Manuel Pellegrini was adamant that Stones' challenge should have been penalised and his side awarded a \"clear penalty\".\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"Everyone in the stadium could see it was a penalty - it was so near to the referee and so clear,\" said the Chilean. \"Both Raheem's legs were taken by Stones but if he doesn't whistle we can't say anything.\"\nUnsurprisingly, Everton boss Roberto Martinez had an opposing view of the incident and praised the \"maturity\" of referee Roger East.\n\"We have been on the back end of receiving a penalty, in the last seconds against Stoke,\" said the Spaniard.\n\"Stones goes to slide to block the ball, Sterling does not play the ball and waited. In my eyes it is an area that is not certain if it's a penalty or not.\n\"I believe the referees should control their emotions and the referee did exactly that. It is impossible to be 100% certain and I am pleased he did this and showed his maturity.\"\nThis game was the second part of a fixture trilogy between these sides in January, falling between the two legs of a Capital One Cup semi-final.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nA week ago, Romelu Lukaku's winner gave Everton a 2-1 victory at Goodison Park, and they impressed again in a performance that showcased both sides of their game.\nIn the first half, the Toffees were patient and precise when they had the ball and hard-working when they did not.

Further, it was, and presently remains, under the control of IS.\n\"It is said on your behalf that you do not support much of what IS do. It is not easy to reconcile this submission with the assertion that you believe that Sharia law is only enforced properly by IS.\n\"In any event, the nature of the regime imposed by IS in Syria is clear.

It's also exactly 10 years since he won the same prize for his 2006 Irish drama The Wind That Shakes The Barley, starring Cillian Murphy.\nLoach uses I, Daniel Blake to expose the welfare system in the UK, and says he wants the film \"to break audience's hearts, but also to make them angry\".\nDaniel Blake, played by stand-up comedian Dave Johns, is an older man living in Newcastle who, because of a heart attack, can no longer do his job.\nHowever, a mobility test by the Department of Work and Pensions declares him fit for work and while he waits for his appeal, Daniel Blake can only claim Jobseekers Allowance.\nHis inability to take any work offered means his money is stopped, and he begins to go hungry.\nLoach, a social campaigner for most of his career, believes the current criteria for claiming benefits in the UK is \"a Kafka-esque, Catch 22 situation designed to frustrate and humiliate the claimant to such an extent that they drop out of the system and stop pursuing their right to ask for support if necessary\".\n\"The state's attitude is not an accident,\" he claims.\n\"The poverty, the indignity, the humiliation people go through is consciously done.\n\"The state is knowingly inefficient or cruel, knowing that people will be driven to frustration, despair, hunger and possible suicide.\n\"Claimants are portrayed as 'scroungers' in the media but research has found that less than 1% of claims for benefits are fraudulent.\n\"That's certainly less than the figures for tax evasion, for example.\n\"But there's an attitude that suggests that if you're poor, it's your fault. If you are out of a job, it's your fault.

It's also exactly 10 years since he won the same prize for his 2006 Irish drama The Wind That Shakes The Barley, starring Cillian Murphy.\nLoach uses I, Daniel Blake to expose the welfare system in the UK, and says he wants the film \"to break audience's hearts, but also to make them angry\".\nDaniel Blake, played by stand-up comedian Dave Johns, is an older man living in Newcastle who, because of a heart attack, can no longer do his job.\nHowever, a mobility test by the Department of Work and Pensions declares him fit for work and while he waits for his appeal, Daniel Blake can only claim Jobseekers Allowance.\nHis inability to take any work offered means his money is stopped, and he begins to go hungry.\nLoach, a social campaigner for most of his career, believes the current criteria for claiming benefits in the UK is \"a Kafka-esque, Catch 22 situation designed to frustrate and humiliate the claimant to such an extent that they drop out of the system and stop pursuing their right to ask for support if necessary\".\n\"The state's attitude is not an accident,\" he claims.\n\"The poverty, the indignity, the humiliation people go through is consciously done.\n\"The state is knowingly inefficient or cruel, knowing that people will be driven to frustration, despair, hunger and possible suicide.\n\"Claimants are portrayed as 'scroungers' in the media but research has found that less than 1% of claims for benefits are fraudulent.\n\"That's certainly less than the figures for tax evasion, for example.\n\"But there's an attitude that suggests that if you're poor, it's your fault. If you are out of a job, it's your fault. It's done to get the numbers down and the most vulnerable in our society are suffering as a result.\"\nHalf a century ago, Ken Loach wrote the screenplay for the BBC play Cathy Come Home, which examined homelessness in Britain in 1966, and the director says his latest film \"is a snapshot of how life can be lived in Britain in 2016\".\n\"We wanted to explore the human consequences of welfare policy in terms of relationships, and who people become through these policies.\"\nLoach and his long-time collaborator, writer Paul Laverty, spent several months visiting British cities such as Stoke, Newcastle, Liverpool and Glasgow, meeting people seeking work, or on low-paid or zero-hour contracts.\n\"We started in my home town of Nuneaton and met a young lad there who was sleeping on a mattress in a charity home.\n\"He was doing the odd bit of work on zero-hour contracts, he'd given up on benefits - he said it was too humiliating.\n\"He hadn't worked for a couple of weeks, and the week before he hadn't eaten for four days.\n\"I opened his fridge and there was nothing in it - nothing at all.

It wasn't quite like running in flip-flops but it was getting to be a problem.\n\"With 400m to go I looked down and the right shoe was completely loose and my heel was in danger of coming free.

Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nThe unnamed woman had agreed Greater Manchester Police (GMP) could refer to her experience in a training session providing she remained anonymous.\nHowever, she later learned her identity and medical history were disclosed to a wider audience.\nGMP has apologised and said \"steps\" had been taken to stop similar occurrences.\nThe victim's solicitor said the payout was believed to be one of the biggest by a British force in a privacy case.\nIn a witness statement, the woman, who agreed to an out-of-court settlement, said she \"felt betrayed by GMP\".\nThe errors in this case by Greater Manchester Police almost beggar belief. Safeguarding victims is the most important priority in domestic violence police work.\nRevealing a victim's identity, medical history and distressed 999 call, against their wishes, represents very grave mistakes. This episode is hardly likely to increase victims' confidence in the police.\nThe case also illustrates the use of part of the civil law that has principally been seen in cases involving celebrities whose privacy has been breached by newspapers.\n'Misuse of private information' has been argued in a number of cases. It relies on a breach of Article 8 of the 1988 Human Rights Act; the right to respect for a private and family life.\nThe claimant has to establish they have a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the information concerned, and that privacy has been breached.\nThe media can argue the claimant's right to privacy is outweighed by the right to freedom of expression and that there is a public interest in publishing. The police have no such defence.\nThis case shows that Article 8 is not simply for celebrities and that public bodies, such as the police, can be sued if they breach it.\nNick McAleenan, from JMW Solicitors, described his client as a \"successful, professional woman\".\nHe said she \"suffered psychiatric harm\" after learning that her personal information was disclosed and that a tape of her 999 call following an assault was played at a training session.\nHe added that GMP had initially refused to accept it had done anything wrong and its internal investigation concluded that no officer had infringed the police code of conduct.\nIn May 2014, the force admitted breaching the woman's privacy but refused to acknowledge she had suffered distress or loss as a result which would entitle her to any damages.\nMr McAleenan said: \"This is information out there in the public domain.

Safeguarding victims is the most important priority in domestic violence police work.\nRevealing a victim's identity, medical history and distressed 999 call, against their wishes, represents very grave mistakes. This episode is hardly likely to increase victims' confidence in the police.\nThe case also illustrates the use of part of the civil law that has principally been seen in cases involving celebrities whose privacy has been breached by newspapers.\n'Misuse of private information' has been argued in a number of cases. It relies on a breach of Article 8 of the 1988 Human Rights Act; the right to respect for a private and family life.\nThe claimant has to establish they have a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the information concerned, and that privacy has been breached.\nThe media can argue the claimant's right to privacy is outweighed by the right to freedom of expression and that there is a public interest in publishing. The police have no such defence.\nThis case shows that Article 8 is not simply for celebrities and that public bodies, such as the police, can be sued if they breach it.\nNick McAleenan, from JMW Solicitors, described his client as a \"successful, professional woman\".\nHe said she \"suffered psychiatric harm\" after learning that her personal information was disclosed and that a tape of her 999 call following an assault was played at a training session.\nHe added that GMP had initially refused to accept it had done anything wrong and its internal investigation concluded that no officer had infringed the police code of conduct.\nIn May 2014, the force admitted breaching the woman's privacy but refused to acknowledge she had suffered distress or loss as a result which would entitle her to any damages.\nMr McAleenan said: \"This is information out there in the public domain. She can't put the genie back in the bottle and it's something that she is going to have to live with for the rest of her life\".\nA GMP spokeswoman said it was \"an exceptional case\", adding: \"The force has taken action to protect the individual's information to prevent any issue in the future.\"\nShe added: \"We have apologised to the woman involved...

Our profession is hurting. Dallas officers are hurting. We are heartbroken,\" he said.\nHe spoke on behalf of the Dallas Police Department, but his words echoed a personal statement he made six years earlier, in the wake of another Dallas police death.\nIn June 2010, just weeks after he was sworn in as police chief, a young Dallas officer and father was shot dead on father's day. The killer was Mr Brown's 27-year-old son.\n\"My family has not only lost a son, but a fellow police officer and a private citizen lost their lives at the hands of our son,\" he said.\n\"That hurts so deeply I cannot adequately express the sadness I feel inside my heart.\"\nMr Brown's son, David O'Neal Brown Jr, first shot dead a private citizen, Jeremy McMillan, as McMillan drove his family to his sister's house. He then shot police officer Craig Shaw, who was responding to the first shooting, more than a dozen times.\nMr Brown took a leave of absence, according to local news reports from the time, and there was speculation that he would resign.\nIt was not the first time he had suffered loss - in 1988, his former partner Walter Williams was killed in the line of duty. Three years later, his younger brother was shot dead by a drug dealer.\nBut Mr Brown returned to work, determined to improve the Dallas Police Department's relations with the community. The department began to focus on de-escalation rather than force. Mr Brown placed emphasis on community policing and increasing transparency, even at the cost of clashing with department figures.\nHe made enemies of the police unions by publicly sacking crooked officers, the Dallas Observer reported. He was told community policing was a waste of time.\nBut by 2014, five years after his appointment, excessive force complaints against Dallas officers had fallen by 64%.\n\"In my opinion, how can you argue with aggressive community policing if it has yielded the safest the city has been over 86 years?\" he said in an interview with the Observer in February.\nMr Brown's approach was visible on Thursday, in the hours before the gunman opened fire, as the police department's Twitter account posted pictures of officers posing with protesters and smiling.\n\"Men, women, boys and girls gathered at Belo Garden Park for the demonstration re: recent police involved shootings,\" said one tweet.\n\"Dallas police officers maintain traffic control to ensure the safety of the demonstrators,\" said another.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, several reporters who cover the Dallas Police Department pointed out the irony that the gunman targeted a force which had made strides to break the cycle of violence between its officers and community.\nSpeaking to the Observer in February, Mr Brown paid tribute to his officers and acknowledged the risks they took.\n\"Over the last 12 years we've lost five cops in the line of duty,\" he said. \"I mean, it's not just numbers on a page.

Our profession is hurting. Dallas officers are hurting. We are heartbroken,\" he said.\nHe spoke on behalf of the Dallas Police Department, but his words echoed a personal statement he made six years earlier, in the wake of another Dallas police death.\nIn June 2010, just weeks after he was sworn in as police chief, a young Dallas officer and father was shot dead on father's day. The killer was Mr Brown's 27-year-old son.\n\"My family has not only lost a son, but a fellow police officer and a private citizen lost their lives at the hands of our son,\" he said.\n\"That hurts so deeply I cannot adequately express the sadness I feel inside my heart.\"\nMr Brown's son, David O'Neal Brown Jr, first shot dead a private citizen, Jeremy McMillan, as McMillan drove his family to his sister's house. He then shot police officer Craig Shaw, who was responding to the first shooting, more than a dozen times.\nMr Brown took a leave of absence, according to local news reports from the time, and there was speculation that he would resign.\nIt was not the first time he had suffered loss - in 1988, his former partner Walter Williams was killed in the line of duty. Three years later, his younger brother was shot dead by a drug dealer.\nBut Mr Brown returned to work, determined to improve the Dallas Police Department's relations with the community. The department began to focus on de-escalation rather than force. Mr Brown placed emphasis on community policing and increasing transparency, even at the cost of clashing with department figures.\nHe made enemies of the police unions by publicly sacking crooked officers, the Dallas Observer reported. He was told community policing was a waste of time.\nBut by 2014, five years after his appointment, excessive force complaints against Dallas officers had fallen by 64%.\n\"In my opinion, how can you argue with aggressive community policing if it has yielded the safest the city has been over 86 years?\" he said in an interview with the Observer in February.\nMr Brown's approach was visible on Thursday, in the hours before the gunman opened fire, as the police department's Twitter account posted pictures of officers posing with protesters and smiling.\n\"Men, women, boys and girls gathered at Belo Garden Park for the demonstration re: recent police involved shootings,\" said one tweet.\n\"Dallas police officers maintain traffic control to ensure the safety of the demonstrators,\" said another.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, several reporters who cover the Dallas Police Department pointed out the irony that the gunman targeted a force which had made strides to break the cycle of violence between its officers and community.\nSpeaking to the Observer in February, Mr Brown paid tribute to his officers and acknowledged the risks they took.\n\"Over the last 12 years we've lost five cops in the line of duty,\" he said. \"I mean, it's not just numbers on a page. It's sacrifice, and it's sacrifice at the highest level.\"\nDallas Police Department equalled that 12-year sacrifice in a few short hours on Thursday. On Friday, Mr Brown reiterated his plea for mutual respect.\n\"There are no words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city,\" he said. \"All I know is that this: This must stop, this divisiveness between our police and our citizens.\"\n\nSummary 1:\nDallas Police Chief David Brown, who had worked to improve community relations and reduce force, was left to confront a racially motivated attack on his officers, echoing his own personal pain from a past tragedy.\n\nSummary 2:\nWhen five Dallas police officers were shot dead by a sniper on Thursday, it fell to David Brown, the city's police chief, to sum up the shock and grief of the force and the community.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

He outplayed me yesterday. Today I came back fresh and was a lot better.\n\"When I was 10-4 down I was missing everything and had nothing left. I said 'pull something together'. If you lose, you want to at least go down fighting.\n\"To have three world titles is unbelievable and to be one of only four players to defend it is something I could only dream of.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSelby was 47-0 up in the 31st frame, and leading 16-14 on frames, when he potted a red before attempting to roll up to the black ball. It was unclear whether the balls touched and referee Jan Verhaas called a foul.\nSelby questioned the decision and score marker Brendan Moore checked the incident on a TV, initially saying the cueball had hit.\nThe decision was reversed but Moore looked at it from another angle and said he was not sure.\nVerhaas then said, \"If you are not sure, I will stick to the original decision\" and the foul stood.\nJohn Parrott said on BBC TV: \"I don't think it touched, it did not quite get there and the referee got it right,\" while Steve Davis added: \"From one angle, I think it touched but from another I don't think it did.\"\nHiggins took the frame and went just one behind at 16-15, but Selby took the last two he required.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLeicester player Selby was out-of-sorts during Sunday's play at the Crucible, missing straightforward opportunities in the reds to hand his opponent the initiative.\nBut the 33-year-old, who was named 'The Torturer' by Ronnie O'Sullivan for his gritty victory in 2014 from 10-5 behind, showed similar uncompromising characteristics with a ruthless display.\nThe third session was the turning point, a slow, turgid affair when he won six out of the seven frames to hold the advantage by two frames.\nIn the final session, the pre-match favourite made breaks of 71, 70 and a 131 clearance following the contentious call in the 31st frame.\nSelby also matches the record of five ranking titles in a season, previously achieved by Hendry in 1990/91 and Ding Junhui in 2013/14, and now has 12 in total.\nA dreadful collapse for Higgins means he missed out on moving into second place on his own in the list of most ranking titles won and remains one behind O'Sullivan's five world victories.\nHaving come through a comfortable semi-final against Barry Hawkins, he was initially at ease against Selby, stroking in a 141 break which equalled O'Sullivan's effort in 2012 as the best break recorded in a World Championship final.\nI'm proud of myself but he was too good on the day\nBut the 41-year-old lost his way on the final day, and late breaks of 88 and 111 were not enough, as he was left frustrated by his rival's dogged performance.\nThe four-time champion has now lost two finals, but his run moves him up to second in the world rankings behind his opponent.\n\"Mark is granite, just granite,\" said Higgins. \"In the second session I had my chances, I missed a pink into the middle and I could have gone 9-3 ahead.\n\"That was a big, big frame. Mark cleared up under extreme pressure. He is a fantastic champion.\n\"It has been an unbelievable tournament, I gave everything. I came up short to a great champion.

He outplayed me yesterday. Today I came back fresh and was a lot better.\n\"When I was 10-4 down I was missing everything and had nothing left. I said 'pull something together'.

It was unclear whether the balls touched and referee Jan Verhaas called a foul.\nSelby questioned the decision and score marker Brendan Moore checked the incident on a TV, initially saying the cueball had hit.\nThe decision was reversed but Moore looked at it from another angle and said he was not sure.\nVerhaas then said, \"If you are not sure, I will stick to the original decision\" and the foul stood.\nJohn Parrott said on BBC TV: \"I don't think it touched, it did not quite get there and the referee got it right,\" while Steve Davis added: \"From one angle, I think it touched but from another I don't think it did.\"\nHiggins took the frame and went just one behind at 16-15, but Selby took the last two he required.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLeicester player Selby was out-of-sorts during Sunday's play at the Crucible, missing straightforward opportunities in the reds to hand his opponent the initiative.\nBut the 33-year-old, who was named 'The Torturer' by Ronnie O'Sullivan for his gritty victory in 2014 from 10-5 behind, showed similar uncompromising characteristics with a ruthless display.\nThe third session was the turning point, a slow, turgid affair when he won six out of the seven frames to hold the advantage by two frames.\nIn the final session, the pre-match favourite made breaks of 71, 70 and a 131 clearance following the contentious call in the 31st frame.\nSelby also matches the record of five ranking titles in a season, previously achieved by Hendry in 1990/91 and Ding Junhui in 2013/14, and now has 12 in total.\nA dreadful collapse for Higgins means he missed out on moving into second place on his own in the list of most ranking titles won and remains one behind O'Sullivan's five world victories.\nHaving come through a comfortable semi-final against Barry Hawkins, he was initially at ease against Selby, stroking in a 141 break which equalled O'Sullivan's effort in 2012 as the best break recorded in a World Championship final.\nI'm proud of myself but he was too good on the day\nBut the 41-year-old lost his way on the final day, and late breaks of 88 and 111 were not enough, as he was left frustrated by his rival's dogged performance.\nThe four-time champion has now lost two finals, but his run moves him up to second in the world rankings behind his opponent.\n\"Mark is granite, just granite,\" said Higgins. \"In the second session I had my chances, I missed a pink into the middle and I could have gone 9-3 ahead.\n\"That was a big, big frame. Mark cleared up under extreme pressure. He is a fantastic champion.\n\"It has been an unbelievable tournament, I gave everything. I came up short to a great champion.

One of the summaries was written by you, and one was not, and I want you to tell me which one you think you wrote. The prompt given to the summary writer was: \"Provide a one-sentence summary (no more than 30 words) with no other text.\". Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nAfter Brexit, that would obviously exclude London where the vast majority is currently done.\nThat has always been a major grievance for other European capitals who sense an opportunity to restart an old fight for a big prize.\nLondon's financial district - or \"The City\" - is like a coral reef. It has grown into a complex ecosystem over hundreds of years with lots of specialist organisms feeding off each other.\nThe coral is home to plants and anemones which in turn are home to fish, and crustacea of dazzling variety.\nBankers and traders may be the apex predators but there are lawyers, accountants, insurance brokers and tech workers swimming around them.\nIt's very hard to replicate but that doesn't mean it can't be damaged. If you chip a bit off - you lose a few of the resident clownfish too.\nThat rather extended metaphor is perhaps one way to think about the subject of euro clearing. It's a very basic, boring and yet incredibly important bit of the reef.\nClearing is the process by which a third party organisation acts as an intermediary for both buyer and seller.\nThey deal with the clearing \"house\" rather than each other which centralises everything and makes the whole complex business easier and quicker. 75% of all everything bought and sold in euros - anywhere in the world - is cleared in London - some 850 billion euros EVERY DAY.\nClearing houses also bear the risks that once side of the transaction doesn't cough up.\nIn return for that risk, buyers and sellers have to keep money in a special account with the clearing house in case there are problems. The more business you do with them, the less money proportionately of your trading volumes you need to keep in that account. Bigger clearing houses are therefore cheaper for their customers.\nIf you start chipping bits off the reef and carting them off to Europe those costs could rise. Some estimates put the cost of fragmenting this bit of the reef at an additional 77bn euros to the people that use them.\nIt would cost UK jobs too. An Ernst and Young study last year estimated that over 80,000 UK jobs would go if euro-clearing moved from London.\nOther financial centres have tried for years to steal this business. In fact, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt tried to insist that all euro trades in the EU were done inside the eurozone.

One of the summaries was written by you, and one was not, and I want you to tell me which one you think you wrote. The prompt given to the summary writer was: \"Provide a one-sentence summary (no more than 30 words) with no other text.\". Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nAfter Brexit, that would obviously exclude London where the vast majority is currently done.\nThat has always been a major grievance for other European capitals who sense an opportunity to restart an old fight for a big prize.\nLondon's financial district - or \"The City\" - is like a coral reef. It has grown into a complex ecosystem over hundreds of years with lots of specialist organisms feeding off each other.\nThe coral is home to plants and anemones which in turn are home to fish, and crustacea of dazzling variety.\nBankers and traders may be the apex predators but there are lawyers, accountants, insurance brokers and tech workers swimming around them.\nIt's very hard to replicate but that doesn't mean it can't be damaged. If you chip a bit off - you lose a few of the resident clownfish too.\nThat rather extended metaphor is perhaps one way to think about the subject of euro clearing. It's a very basic, boring and yet incredibly important bit of the reef.\nClearing is the process by which a third party organisation acts as an intermediary for both buyer and seller.\nThey deal with the clearing \"house\" rather than each other which centralises everything and makes the whole complex business easier and quicker. 75% of all everything bought and sold in euros - anywhere in the world - is cleared in London - some 850 billion euros EVERY DAY.\nClearing houses also bear the risks that once side of the transaction doesn't cough up.\nIn return for that risk, buyers and sellers have to keep money in a special account with the clearing house in case there are problems. The more business you do with them, the less money proportionately of your trading volumes you need to keep in that account. Bigger clearing houses are therefore cheaper for their customers.\nIf you start chipping bits off the reef and carting them off to Europe those costs could rise. Some estimates put the cost of fragmenting this bit of the reef at an additional 77bn euros to the people that use them.\nIt would cost UK jobs too. An Ernst and Young study last year estimated that over 80,000 UK jobs would go if euro-clearing moved from London.\nOther financial centres have tried for years to steal this business. In fact, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt tried to insist that all euro trades in the EU were done inside the eurozone. A policy it had to scrap when the European Court of Justice ruled in 2015 it discriminated against non-eurozone countries who are part of the EU.\nIf that court case is run again once the UK is outside the EU, that defence no longer works.\nThis new raiding party is led by the EU Financial Services Commissioner Valdis Dombrovkis who is arguing that either the EU has greater policing powers over clearing in London (a cup of cold sick in political and regulatory terms) or, the business has to relocate to the EU (two cups).\nIt's not clear, however, that a defeat for London would be a victory for the EU.

Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nIts survey of leading employers found that, while 54% of students are women, they make up just 47% of graduate scheme applicants.\nBut they took 49% of the posts, the responses by 170 employers showed.\n\"Many women don't apply for the top schemes when they should,\" said AGR chief executive Stephen Isherwood.\nImproving the gender diversity of graduate programmes is largely a challenge of attracting women in the first place, says the report.\nOnce they apply women are more likely to be hired, according to the survey sent to AGR members in April this year.\nEven in male-dominated areas such as IT and engineering, women are proportionally more likely to succeed once they decide to apply, the survey found.\nFor example, women make up only 17% of IT students and 15% of engineering students, but succeed in getting 27% and 25% respectively of the places on graduate schemes in these fields, the report suggests.\nThis means that while men make up 83% and 85% of the student population in these fields, they find it relatively tougher to get work - taking 73% and 75% of the jobs.\nBut in the field of law the reverse is true - 63% of students are female but only 58% of the graduate scheme posts go to women.\nGraduate employers are making efforts to boost the numbers of women they hire, the research found.\nThree quarters of the firms which responded to the survey had a diversity strategy in place, and the majority said redressing workplace gender imbalance was the highest priority.\nConstruction and engineering firms were particularly successful, increasing the share of women hires by 3% and 4% respectively in a year, says the report.\nMr Isherwood says considerable barriers to gender equality remain.\n\"Graduate employers want to hire women, there are lots of opportunities out there and these candidates are more likely to succeed, so we need to address why they're not applying.

Industry-wide collaboration to tackle student perceptions will be a key step forward.\n\"We know women are hugely successful in the selection process. We just need them to realise it.

It has to be met with disgust and much stronger resistance than has so far been the case.\"\nThe anti-immigration rhetoric has been toned down and carefully argued, with a policy of preferring to help refugees in their own countries.\nThere are obvious parallels with France's National Front which, under the leadership of Marine Le Pen, has moved into the political mainstream.\nThe two parties go back many years, and Ms Le Pen visited Jimmie Akesson last year in Stockholm.

So these starter homes will be sold at 20% less than the market value.\n\"They can't be bought by foreigners, they can't be bought by buy-to-let landlords, they can't be flipped round in a quick sale.

They have 63 points from 26 games - three more than at the same stage in 2014-15 when last crowned champions of England.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFabregas could have ended the game with four goals on his return to the side.\nThe Spain midfielder had a goal-bound shot deflected behind shortly before he opened the scoring, was denied by former Arsenal team-mate Lukasz Fabianski and also rattled the bar.\nWith former Blues midfielder Frank Lampard watching on, Chelsea turned on the style.\nWhile it required an error from Fabianski to restore the lead, Eden Hazard's exquisite timing and pass for Costa to make it 3-1 was a delight.\nChelsea were forced to work hard for three points thanks to a well organised and energetic Swansea side and the Swans looked a shadow of the team that was bottom of the Premier League table five weeks ago.\nTheir four-point safety cushion at the start of the day is down to three, but boss Paul Clement will have been pleased with the way his side frustrated the runaway leaders for long spells.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLlorente's equaliser shook Chelsea who were showing signs of frustration before Pedro made it 2-1.\nSwansea's next four games - Burnley (home), Hull City (away), Bournemouth (away) and Middlesbrough (home) - give them a chance to stay clear of the bottom three before they entertain Tottenham on 4 April.\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"We played very well, it was a good performance, and we created many chances to score. We conceded at the end of the first half, after the time was finished, so in this case there was a bit of luck, but we showed great character in the second half.\n\"We deserved a lot to win the game, now it's important to continue in this way.\"\nSwansea City boss Paul Clement: \"Any game we play and don't win we are disappointed. Chelsea are a very good side, they have fantastic quality and that was the difference. We didn't have a lot of chances but we came in at 1-1 for half-time and for long periods we defended really well.\n\"There was a big moment with the handball, I thought Cesar Azpilicueta handled it at 1-1, it's a clear handball. That gives you a chance to go 2-1 up but three minutes later you're 2-1 down with a soft goal. Based on chances they deserved to win, but there was  big moment that didn't go our way, and who knows what might have happened.\"\nFormer England midfielder Jermaine Jenas: \"I don't think Swansea should have had a penalty as the distance from Gylfi Sigurdsson to Cesar Azpilicueta is too close and Azpilicueta's arm is already out. His hand is there because he's trying to stop Sigurdsson's run.\"\nEx-England captain Alan Shearer: \"I think it was a penalty. I think it was a deliberate movement of his hand towards the ball and I think Chelsea got away with one there. It could have been very different if the ref had given it.\n\"We've seen in recent weeks with Swansea that they made it very difficult for Liverpool at Anfield, they were unlucky to lose at Manchester City. They are very organised. The difference between Liverpool and City with this Chelsea side is the pace with which they go forward. That's why Cesc Fabregas was in the team today. He was brilliant. He's the one that started the goal off.\n\"It's topical that players are not working for mangers. The irony is last season we were sat here with a large bunch of these same Chelsea players - they weren't working for their manager and we know what happened. It's such a transformation now. We saw how brilliant they were with the ball but look at them now without it. The transformation from then to now is incredible.\"\nChelsea have nine days to prepare for their next game away to West Ham United on Monday, 6 March (20:00 GMT).

They have 63 points from 26 games - three more than at the same stage in 2014-15 when last crowned champions of England.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFabregas could have ended the game with four goals on his return to the side.\nThe Spain midfielder had a goal-bound shot deflected behind shortly before he opened the scoring, was denied by former Arsenal team-mate Lukasz Fabianski and also rattled the bar.\nWith former Blues midfielder Frank Lampard watching on, Chelsea turned on the style.\nWhile it required an error from Fabianski to restore the lead, Eden Hazard's exquisite timing and pass for Costa to make it 3-1 was a delight.\nChelsea were forced to work hard for three points thanks to a well organised and energetic Swansea side and the Swans looked a shadow of the team that was bottom of the Premier League table five weeks ago.\nTheir four-point safety cushion at the start of the day is down to three, but boss Paul Clement will have been pleased with the way his side frustrated the runaway leaders for long spells.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLlorente's equaliser shook Chelsea who were showing signs of frustration before Pedro made it 2-1.\nSwansea's next four games - Burnley (home), Hull City (away), Bournemouth (away) and Middlesbrough (home) - give them a chance to stay clear of the bottom three before they entertain Tottenham on 4 April.\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"We played very well, it was a good performance, and we created many chances to score. We conceded at the end of the first half, after the time was finished, so in this case there was a bit of luck, but we showed great character in the second half.\n\"We deserved a lot to win the game, now it's important to continue in this way.\"\nSwansea City boss Paul Clement: \"Any game we play and don't win we are disappointed. Chelsea are a very good side, they have fantastic quality and that was the difference. We didn't have a lot of chances but we came in at 1-1 for half-time and for long periods we defended really well.\n\"There was a big moment with the handball, I thought Cesar Azpilicueta handled it at 1-1, it's a clear handball. That gives you a chance to go 2-1 up but three minutes later you're 2-1 down with a soft goal. Based on chances they deserved to win, but there was  big moment that didn't go our way, and who knows what might have happened.\"\nFormer England midfielder Jermaine Jenas: \"I don't think Swansea should have had a penalty as the distance from Gylfi Sigurdsson to Cesar Azpilicueta is too close and Azpilicueta's arm is already out. His hand is there because he's trying to stop Sigurdsson's run.\"\nEx-England captain Alan Shearer: \"I think it was a penalty. I think it was a deliberate movement of his hand towards the ball and I think Chelsea got away with one there. It could have been very different if the ref had given it.\n\"We've seen in recent weeks with Swansea that they made it very difficult for Liverpool at Anfield, they were unlucky to lose at Manchester City. They are very organised. The difference between Liverpool and City with this Chelsea side is the pace with which they go forward. That's why Cesc Fabregas was in the team today. He was brilliant. He's the one that started the goal off.\n\"It's topical that players are not working for mangers. The irony is last season we were sat here with a large bunch of these same Chelsea players - they weren't working for their manager and we know what happened. It's such a transformation now. We saw how brilliant they were with the ball but look at them now without it. The transformation from then to now is incredible.\"\nChelsea have nine days to prepare for their next game away to West Ham United on Monday, 6 March (20:00 GMT).

He was quoted at the inquiry as having said: \"Maybe the only way it will go away is if I deal with it myself.

Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nIf he does become the next Premier League manager to lose his job, it would not just be unfair, it would be absolutely ridiculous.\nI cleaned Tim's boots when I was an apprentice at Norwich in the late 1980s, and he was the captain at Blackburn Rovers when we won the Premier League together in 1995.\nOf course I am not just backing him to succeed at Villa because I used to play with him - the reason is that, since the earliest days of my career, I have always seen him as manager material.\nWhen I was a teenager I looked up to him because I liked the way he went about things and how he dealt with me and other people. Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same.\nCharacter is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them.\nAt 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions.\nWe had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry.\nThey were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain.\nFor Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too.\nHe always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game.\nHe comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did.\nSo it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him.\nAt times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it.\nThese days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up.\nTim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.\nVilla have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different.\nBut, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure.\nYou have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made.\nVilla's net spend over the summer was under \u00a310m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience.\nThey have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem.\nI don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process.\nYou cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day.\nI get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now.\nSherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got.\nThe choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is.\nLike Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League.\nIn an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders.\nBut what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker.\nSherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat.\nWhoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own.\nBecause he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder.\nGrealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball.\nHowever good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way.\nWhen you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again.\nYou really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table.\nThat might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter.\nAfter trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games.\nA settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment.

One of the summaries was written by you, and one was not, and I want you to tell me which one you think you wrote. The prompt given to the summary writer was: \"Provide a one-sentence summary (no more than 30 words) with no other text.\". Think about your writing style and the kinds of things you would say about this article given that prompt, and based on that identify the summary you think you wrote by outputting its corresponding number, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nArticle:\nIf he does become the next Premier League manager to lose his job, it would not just be unfair, it would be absolutely ridiculous.\nI cleaned Tim's boots when I was an apprentice at Norwich in the late 1980s, and he was the captain at Blackburn Rovers when we won the Premier League together in 1995.\nOf course I am not just backing him to succeed at Villa because I used to play with him - the reason is that, since the earliest days of my career, I have always seen him as manager material.\nWhen I was a teenager I looked up to him because I liked the way he went about things and how he dealt with me and other people. Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same.\nCharacter is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them.\nAt 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions.\nWe had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry.\nThey were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain.\nFor Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too.\nHe always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game.\nHe comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did.\nSo it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him.\nAt times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it.\nThese days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up.\nTim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.\nVilla have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different.\nBut, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure.\nYou have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made.\nVilla's net spend over the summer was under \u00a310m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience.\nThey have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem.\nI don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process.\nYou cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day.\nI get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now.\nSherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got.\nThe choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is.\nLike Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League.\nIn an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders.\nBut what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker.\nSherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat.\nWhoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own.\nBecause he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder.\nGrealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball.\nHowever good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way.\nWhen you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again.\nYou really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table.\nThat might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter.\nAfter trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games.\nA settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment.

It has now turned into a refuge for those fleeing the fighting in Anbar.\nInside the village's chalets and seven-story hotel are hundreds of families, crammed into rooms that lack adequate sanitation and other basic facilities.\nIn the absence of appropriate medical care due to the army's blockade of the area, skin diseases and viral and bacterial infections are spreading uncontrollably. Children and women are the most vulnerable, especially pregnant women who cannot get access to female doctors.\nThe main roads in and out of Fallujah and Ramadi are part of the battlefield as the army aims to secure supply routes for troops and tries to cut off militant groups.\nThe UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said some 50,000 families had fled their homes since clashes erupted in Ramadi and Falluja after security forces dismantled a long-standing anti-government protest camp led by the Sunni Arab community.\nWhile security forces backed by pro-government tribesmen have made steady progress in retaking areas of Ramadi, they have not launched an offensive to recapture Falluja, fearing a repeat of the two bloody urban battles US troops fought in the city in 2004.\nOver the weekend, Anbar Governor Ahmed al-Dulaimi gave the militants a week to surrender, but said officials would not negotiate with Isis.\n\"With the conflict in Anbar continuing UN agencies continue to receive reports of civilian casualties and sustained hardship in communities impacted by the fighting and the influx of internally displaced persons,\" said UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming.\nMost of the displaced had fled to outlying communities in Anbar province, while 60,000 had ended up in more distant provinces, she added. Many are living in schools, mosques and other public buildings and urgently needed humanitarian aid.\nIn Anbar, Ms Fleming said access remained a challenge, citing reports that a consignment of World Health Organisation (WHO) medical supplies had been detained at an Iraqi army checkpoint since 30 January.\nMany bridges have also been destroyed and roads blocked.\n\nSummary 1:\nMilitants led by ISIS have taken control of parts of Falluja and Ramadi, displacing over 50,000 families, and humanitarian aid is urgently needed to address the growing crisis.\n\nSummary 2:\nUp to 300,000 people have now been displaced by the fighting between Sunni militants and security forces in Iraq's western province of Anbar, the UN says.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

It has now turned into a refuge for those fleeing the fighting in Anbar.\nInside the village's chalets and seven-story hotel are hundreds of families, crammed into rooms that lack adequate sanitation and other basic facilities.\nIn the absence of appropriate medical care due to the army's blockade of the area, skin diseases and viral and bacterial infections are spreading uncontrollably.

It is known for its diverse wildlife which includes orangutans and Sumatran tigers.\nA government moratorium on deforestation was signed in 2011 and was intended to slow down the pace of deforestation.\nBut environmental activists say corrupt politicians are quick to sell off huge swathes of rainforests for profit, and they point to the need for more monitoring and sanctions to stop the rate at which Indonesia is losing its forests, says the BBC's Karishma Vaswani.\nMassive forest fires in Indonesia to clear land last year caused a heavy smog to blanket neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore, triggering health concerns in those countries.\nNorway has pledged a billion dollars to Indonesia if it can prove it is serious about stopping deforestation.\nAgencies report that Norway has paid almost $50 million to Indonesia to help set up new institutions to reduce deforestation.\nBut Indonesia will only start to get large amounts of money if deforestation is slowed down.\n\nSummary 1:\nA new study has shown that Indonesia lost about 60,000 sq km of virgin forest - an area close to the size of Ireland - over a period of 12 years.\n\nSummary 2:\nIndonesia has surpassed Brazil in deforestation rate, with 8,400 sq km of forest lost in 2012, mainly due to palm oil plantations and other agricultural activities.\n\nWhich response do you think you wrote, 1 or 2?

This pardon puts an immediate end to her detention,\" the president tweeted.\nIn a further statement from the Elysee Palace, he said he felt her place was with her family and not in jail.\nA car carrying Ms Sauvage and her three daughters was seen leaving Reau prison soon afterwards.\nCampaigners were overjoyed by the news. But Virginie Duval, the head of the French union of magistrates, complained that the president had acted \"to please public opinion\", pointing out that the judiciary had followed the law when it rejected Ms Sauvage's appeals.\nRead more on the Sauvage case: Should presidents pardon?\nIn August, a local court rejected a plea for parole and its ruling was backed up last month by the court of appeal in Paris.\nMs Sauvage's daughters had fought for her release ever since she was jailed in 2014, insisting that she had been brutally treated throughout her marriage by her husband Norbert Marot. When her son committed suicide, she picked up a gun the following day and shot him.\nJustifying its decision to reject her application for parole in August, the local court at Melun explained that Ms Sauvage had not done enough to show remorse.\nShe could not expect to live in an environment which, because of the media coverage of her case, \"would risk maintaining her in the position of victim\".\nBut Ms Sauvage's case attracted the support of 434,000 people who signed an internet petition as well as dozens of MPs, from both left and right.\nIt also secured the backing of President Hollande, who met her three daughters and gave her a partial pardon, which is part of the constitution but used very rarely.\nHis initial pardon in January was for her sentence to be reduced to a minimum, allowing for the judiciary to decide when she should be freed.

This pardon puts an immediate end to her detention,\" the president tweeted.\nIn a further statement from the Elysee Palace, he said he felt her place was with her family and not in jail.\nA car carrying Ms Sauvage and her three daughters was seen leaving Reau prison soon afterwards.\nCampaigners were overjoyed by the news. But Virginie Duval, the head of the French union of magistrates, complained that the president had acted \"to please public opinion\", pointing out that the judiciary had followed the law when it rejected Ms Sauvage's appeals.\nRead more on the Sauvage case: Should presidents pardon?\nIn August, a local court rejected a plea for parole and its ruling was backed up last month by the court of appeal in Paris.\nMs Sauvage's daughters had fought for her release ever since she was jailed in 2014, insisting that she had been brutally treated throughout her marriage by her husband Norbert Marot. When her son committed suicide, she picked up a gun the following day and shot him.\nJustifying its decision to reject her application for parole in August, the local court at Melun explained that Ms Sauvage had not done enough to show remorse.\nShe could not expect to live in an environment which, because of the media coverage of her case, \"would risk maintaining her in the position of victim\".\nBut Ms Sauvage's case attracted the support of 434,000 people who signed an internet petition as well as dozens of MPs, from both left and right.\nIt also secured the backing of President Hollande, who met her three daughters and gave her a partial pardon, which is part of the constitution but used very rarely.\nHis initial pardon in January was for her sentence to be reduced to a minimum, allowing for the judiciary to decide when she should be freed.
