They have gradually become key players of scientific knowledge dissemination, despite their illegality in most countries of the world. Many publishers and scientist-editors decry such libraries for their copyright infringement and loss of publication usage information, while some scholars and institutions support them, sometimes in a roundabout way, for their role in reducing inequalities of access to knowledge, particularly in low-income countries. Although there is a wealth of literature on shadow libraries, none of this have focused on its potential role in knowledge dissemination, through the open\n\nText continuation:\naccess of academic literature.\nIn recent years, the proliferation of shadow libraries has been fueled by the rise of digital technologies, which have made it easier for individuals to share and access copyrighted materials. The most well-known example of a shadow library is Sci-Hub, which has been described as the \"largest pirate library in the world.\" Founded by Alexandra Elbakyan, a Kazakhstani researcher, Sci-Hub has made over 80 million research papers available for free, bypassing traditional publishing routes and subscription-based journals. While Sci-Hub has been the subject of controversy and legal action, it has also been hailed as a game-changer for researchers in low-income countries, where access to academic literature is often limited by financial constraints.\nDespite the controversy surrounding shadow libraries, they have also been recognized as a means of promoting knowledge sharing and collaboration. In 2018, a study published in the Journal of the Association for Information and Image Management found that researchers who used shadow libraries were more likely to collaborate with colleagues from other countries and institutions. This finding suggests that shadow libraries may be playing a role in promoting global knowledge sharing and collaboration, even if this is not their primary intention.\nIn addition to their potential role in promoting knowledge sharing, shadow libraries have also been recognized as a means of promoting social justice and reducing inequalities in access to knowledge. In a world where academic literature is often priced out of reach for many researchers, shadow libraries offer a means of leveling the playing field and ensuring that all researchers have access to the knowledge they need to advance their research. This is particularly important in low-income countries, where the cost of accessing academic literature can be prohibitively expensive.\nOverall, the role of shadow libraries in knowledge dissemination is complex and multifaceted. While they may be illegal, they have also been recognized as a means of promoting knowledge sharing, collaboration, and social justice. As the academic publishing landscape continues to evolve, it is likely that the role of shadow libraries will continue to be debated and contested.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"f\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Although there is a wealth of literature on shadow libraries, none of this have focused on its potential role in knowledge dissemination, through the open\n\nText continuation:\naccess movement. Here we analyze how shadow libraries can affect researchers' citation practices, highlighting some counter-intuitive findings about their impact on the Open Access Citation Advantage (OACA). Based on a large randomized sample, this study first shows that OA publications, including those in fully OA journals, receive more citations than their subscription-based counterparts do. However, the OACA has slightly decreased over the seven last years. The introduction of a distinction between those accessible or not via the Scihub platform among subscription-based suggest that the generalization of its use cancels the positive effect of OA publishing. The results show that publications in fully OA journals are victims of the success of Sci-hub. Thus, paradoxically, although Sci-hub may seem to facilitate access to scientific knowledge, it negatively affects the OA movement as a whole, by reducing the comparative advantage of OA publications in terms of visibility for researchers. The democratization of the use of Sci-hub may therefore lead to a vicious cycle, hindering efforts to develop full OA strategies without proposing a credible and sustainable alternative model for the dissemination of scientific knowledge.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Eritrea\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Approved", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

If your looking to help, dropping of a fresh pack will go along way for relatively cheap.\nAlso helps prevent against frostbite, bacterial infection, and provides good warmth.\nslaxipants: Genuine question, recently I was going through my stuff and threw out loads of old, but still in one piece, socks, because my wife said no charity wants old socks. Was she mistaken or should we only donate new socks?\ndkeate: For the most part, if you ask the question \"would someone pay money for this item in its current condition?\" and the answer is no, do not donate the item. \nI dont think anyone would buy old used socks.\nDontAshOnTheDog: I mean, if I was homeless and someone offered me some clean (but used) socks\n\nText continuation:\n, I'd be like \"hell yeah, thank you so much!\" It's not like I'm going to be picky about the source of the socks. A clean pair of socks is a clean pair of socks, regardless of whether they've been worn before or not. And let's be real, the people who are homeless are already dealing with so much hardship, they don't need to be turned away from a donation because of something as trivial as the socks being used.\nBernardhopkins: That's a great point, DontAshOnTheDog. And it's not just about the practicality of the socks, it's also about the thought and effort that goes into donating them. Someone took the time to sort through their old socks and set them aside, and then they're giving them away to someone who really needs them. That's a kind and generous act, regardless of whether the socks are new or used.\nslaxipants: I see what you're saying, Bernardhopkins. But I still think it's worth considering the potential drawbacks of donating used socks. For example, if the socks have been worn and washed a bunch of times, they might not be as warm or comfortable as new socks. And if they're made of a synthetic material, they could potentially cause skin irritation or other problems.\ndkeate: That's a good point, slaxipants. And it's also worth considering the environmental impact of donating used socks. If we're going to be donating a lot of used items, we should make sure that we're not contributing to the problem of fast fashion and waste. Maybe we could look into donating new socks made from sustainable materials, or finding other ways to reduce our environmental footprint.\nBernardhopkins: That's a great idea, dkeate. And it's not just about the socks themselves, it's about the bigger picture of how we can make a positive impact on the world. By donating socks, we're not just giving people a practical item, we're also showing them that we care about their well-being and are willing to take the time to help them out.\nslaxipants: I think that's a great way to look at it, Bernardhopkins. And who knows, maybe one day we'll be able to donate socks that are not only warm and comfortable, but also sustainable and environmentally friendly.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"n\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Bern", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

It\u2019s a win win in my book\nSeaNilly: Well that quickly changed from fuck you for throwing away socks that are 50% holes to fuck the homeless for not wanting to go to a homeless shelter and get shit quality socks. \nI\u2019ve been trying to be relatively nice but what the fuck are you even talking about.

It's like having a safety net that's always there, even when you're not thinking about it.\nMeanwhile, the revolutionary new treatment for diabetes is making headlines around the world. The treatment, developed by Harvard scientists, has shown incredible promise in clinical trials and is expected to be a game-changer for millions of people living with the disease. The treatment works by using a combination of gene editing and stem cell therapy to regenerate the pancreas and restore its ability to produce insulin.\nThe Australian team, led by Dr. Emma Smith, has made significant progress in their own research and is expected to release more details about their treatment soon. While the two treatments may differ in their approach, both have the potential to revolutionize the way we treat diabetes and improve the lives of those affected by the disease.\nAs the news of these breakthroughs spreads, many people are left wondering what this means for the future of diabetes treatment. Will these new treatments finally bring an end to the devastating effects of diabetes? Only time will tell, but for now, the hope is palpable.\nThe implications of these treatments go far beyond just the individuals affected by diabetes. They also have the potential to transform the way we approach healthcare as a whole. With the ability to regenerate organs and restore function, the possibilities are endless. Imagine a world where organs can be regrown and replaced, eliminating the need for transplants and the associated risks.\nOf course, there are still many challenges to overcome before these treatments become widely available. The cost of developing and implementing these treatments is significant, and there are many ethical considerations that must be taken into account. But the potential benefits are undeniable, and it's clear that we're on the cusp of a major breakthrough in the fight against diabetes.\nAs we wait with bated breath for the results of these treatments, it's clear that the future of healthcare is looking brighter than ever. With the help of scientists like Dr. Emma Smith and her team, we may finally be able to say goodbye to the devastating effects of diabetes and hello to a future where health and wellness are within reach for everyone.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"r\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Good", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Nothing is free.\nVagueSomething: Your pedantry is free apparently though.

We all understand that paying taxes together as a collective gives far better value and purchasing power. You never notice paying for\n\nText continuation:\nit, you are free to walk up and get treatment. It is the freedom to enjoy access to health care and to be healthier without unnecessary Middlemen or predatory charges when you're desperate.\n\nWe do not need to write a disclaimer to appease the \"Ackchually\" attitude. It may be something to explain to a young child but I guarantee they'll quickly understand it.\nrosts: It's not pedantry by any means. I'm strongly for universal healthcare, but I call it universal healthcare. Saying it's free gives people a delusion that it's actually free. Just say universal healthcare. Argue for why it's superior, but don't call it free, because it's not.\nVagueSomething: Everyone understands it isn't free. Everyone understands free means free at point of access but is shortened because it isn't necessary to say every time.\n\nThe \"its not free don't call it free\" is all about moving goalposts to shift the narrative in a way to undermine the freedom, the right to access health care.\ngr8uddini: It\u2019s like saying \u201cin America we have access to free and clean water.\u201d  Is it actually free? No. but you never hear people arguing saying \u201cbUt ItS nOt AcTuAlLy FrEe!\u201d\nVagueSomething: Yep. It is a desperate attempt to tar the idea because they know the concept is so appealing and multiple countries have successfully implemented version of it that only truly struggle because Right Wing groups keep trying to break it so they can make American Health Care profits from other vulnerable people.\nrosts: I want people to call it the correct term precisely to not give conservatives an easy target. I have never met anyone arguing against the term \"universal healthcare\", but for very good reasons they do when you call it free. The word is inflammatory.\nCalling it universal healthcare and arguing for why publicly funded healthcare makes sense is damn near guaranteed to yield a better outcome, and that's what I care about.\nVagueSomething: They still argue against it with equally stupid soundbites they've been fed alongside the \"its not really free even though you're not directly paying and it is decoupled from your earnings.\"\nR_Prime: You realise we do actually have to pay money out of our bank accounts for the vast majority of healthcare in Australia though right?\nVagueSomething: Sure, Australian system isn't ideal but still better and at least partly free.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Mauritius\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Good", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "V", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Over time that\u2019s how you become popular, as well as being good or like able!\nFrothySolutions: But I'm looking for a community, not a club. Work would be a community\n\nText continuation:\n, but I'm not sure if that's the right fit. Maybe I can find a community online, like a forum or a social media group dedicated to a specific topic or interest. But how do I go about finding it? And once I find it, how do I make sure I'm a valued member of that community?\nI think the key is to be genuine and authentic. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. People can usually tell when you're being insincere, and it's a major turnoff. Instead, be yourself and share your unique perspective and experiences. This will help you stand out and make meaningful connections with others.\nAnother important thing is to be active and engaged. Don't just lurk in the shadows, waiting for others to initiate conversations. Take the initiative and start discussions, ask questions, and share your thoughts and opinions. This will show that you're interested and invested in the community, and it will also help you build relationships with others.\nIt's also important to be respectful and open-minded. Listen to others and try to understand their perspectives, even if you don't agree with them. Avoid being confrontational or argumentative, and try to find common ground with others. This will help you build trust and rapport with others, and it will also help you avoid conflicts and drama.\nFinally, be patient and persistent. Building a community and becoming a valued member of it takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results. Keep showing up, being yourself, and engaging with others, and eventually, you'll start to see the fruits of your labor.\nI think the most important thing is to focus on building meaningful relationships with others, rather than trying to be popular or well-known. When you focus on building genuine connections with others, you'll find that popularity and recognition will follow naturally. And even if they don't, you'll still have the satisfaction of knowing that you've made a positive impact on others and that you've built a community that values and appreciates you for who you are.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"n\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Good", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Where I'll be having dinners with people as a business expense.\nGod0fMadness: Because you\u2019re not looking at it from the right angle. You pursue a career and find a community, not pursue a career to find a community. This may come sound rude, but that\u2019s called being fake. Communities are built out of general combined interests and branch from there. That\u2019s why when someone tries to insert themselves without any of the same interests they\u2019re generally shunned or left to the side\nFrothySolutions: But in my job, I'm never asked to go to lunch with anyone. That's the kind of job I need.\nGod0fMadness: Neither am I, yet I come in and know everyone by name, and can have a conversation with any one of them UNIQUE to them. If someone\u2019s goal is to be the best guitar player, they don\u2019t go to a producer or band since they\u2019re renowned, they learn the guitar and become great. It seems you\u2019re confusing the bi-product of others\u2019 drives in life as something to be attained on pure focus alone.\nFrothySolutions: I already know my co-workers names, that's not a \"community\" like I mean though. That's just a small group of friends/acquaintances. I mean a job where I'll be meeting people in the industry and leaving an impression on them. Having business dinners with them and stuff.\nGod0fMadness: Again, then go get that job. If you wanna nitpick at an example or two that\u2019s fine but there\u2019s nothing stopping you from trying to get that job then\nFrothySolutions: But no one will tell me what jobs are actually like that. I keep asking, people keep rejecting me.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Haiti\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "F", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I saw him the first time Tuesday. He was at the cafe. I noticed he was looking at me a lot. Not just the usual looking, but staring. He just kept staring at me. He didn't stop.\nUser 2: What did you do?\nUser 1: I didn't do anything. Finally, he left. But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's. But then he came in too.\nUser 2: Did he leave when you left?\nUser 1: Yes. Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me. He was following me.\nUser 2: What did you do?\nUser 1: He followed me all the way home\n\nText continuation:\n. I didn't know what to do, so I just kept walking and tried to lose him in the crowd. But I could feel his eyes on me the whole time. When I got to my front door, I finally worked up the courage to look back and he was standing across the street, just staring at me again.\nUser 2: Oh, Doris, this is serious. We need to call the police. I'll stay with you until they get here.\nUser 1: Okay, thank you. I'm just so scared. What if he comes back? What if he finds out where I live?\nUser 2: We'll figure it out, Doris. We'll make sure you're safe. And we'll make sure he's caught.\nAs they waited for the police to arrive, Doris couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. She kept looking over her shoulder, expecting to see the stalker's face staring back at her. But every time she turned around, there was no one there. Still, the feeling persisted, making her skin crawl and her heart race.\nThe police finally arrived, and Doris was relieved to see them. She told them everything, from the first time she saw the stalker at the cafe to the latest encounter outside her front door. The officers listened attentively, taking notes and asking questions. They promised to increase patrols in the area and to keep a close eye on Doris's home.\nAs the night wore on, Doris felt a sense of relief wash over her. She knew that she wasn't alone, and that the police were working to keep her safe. She was grateful to have Doris by her side, and she knew that together, they could face whatever lay ahead.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"i\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The method, based on Nitroxide-Mediated Polymerization (NMP), consists to bind covalently the alkoxyamine, which acts as initiator controller agent, at the silica nanoparticles surface in two steps. The first step is a reaction between the aminopropylsilane and the silica particles in order to functionalize the particles surface with amino group. In a second step, the initiating-controlling alkoxyamine moiety is introduced via an over grafting reaction between the amino group and the N-hydroxysuccinimide based MAMA-SG1 activated ester. To simplify both their chemical transformation and the polymerization step, the native silica particles, initially dispersed in water\n\nText continuation:\n, are first modified with aminopropylsilane to introduce amino groups on their surface. This modification enables the subsequent covalent binding of the alkoxyamine moiety, which serves as both an initiator and a controller for the polymerization reaction.\nThe resulting PS-silica nanoparticles exhibit a well-defined structure and a high degree of dispersion, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including biomedicine, catalysis, and optoelectronics. The grafting-from approach used in this method offers several advantages, including the ability to control the size and shape of the nanoparticles, as well as the molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymer chains. Additionally, the use of NMP allows for the synthesis of well-defined polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions, which is critical for many applications.\nFurthermore, the grafting-from method enables the incorporation of functional groups into the polymer chains, which can be used to tailor the properties of the nanoparticles. For example, the incorporation of hydrophilic groups can improve the dispersion of the nanoparticles in aqueous media, while the incorporation of hydrophobic groups can enhance their compatibility with organic solvents. The versatility of this method makes it an attractive approach for the synthesis of PS-silica nanoparticles with tailored properties for specific applications.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"l\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The synthesis parameters have been optimized for grafting density, conversion rates, and synthesis reproducibility while keeping the colloidal stability and to avoid any aggregation of silica particles induced by the inter-particles interaction evolution during the synthesis. After synthesis, the final grafted objects have been purified and the non-grafted polymer chains formed in the solvent have been washed out by ultra filtration. Then the particles have been studied using Small angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) coupled to neutron contrast variation method. To optimize the contrast conditions, both hydrogenated and deuterated monomers have been used for the synthesis. A refined fitting analysis based on the comparison on two models, a basic core-shell and the Gaussian Pedersen model, enables us to fit nicely the experimental data for both the hydrogenated and deuterated grafted case. Differences are seen between grafting of normal or deuterated chains which can be due to monomer reactivity or to neutron contrast effect variations. The synthesis and the characterization method established in this work constitute a robust and reproducible way to design well defined grafted polymer nanoparticles.

Half of the summaries were written by you and half were written by someone else, but I don't know which is which. The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Please give me a summary of the text on the origins of skateboarding.\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary contains the letter \"y\".\n\nArticle:\nThe first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom. Crate scooters preceded skateboards, having a wooden crate attached to the nose (front of the board), which formed rudimentary handlebars. The boxes turned into planks, similar to the skateboard decks of today.\nSkateboarding, as it exists today, was probably born sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s, when surfers in California wanted something to do when the waves were flat. This was called \"sidewalk surfing\" \u2013 a new wave of surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular. No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill Richard, made a deal with the Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted \"sidewalk surfing\" and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.\nBy the 1960s a small number of surfing manufacturers in Southern California such as Jack's, Kips', Hobie, Bing's and Makaha started building skateboards that resembled small surfboards, and assembled teams to promote their products. One of the earliest Skateboard exhibitions was sponsored by Makaha's founder, Larry Stevenson, in 1963 and held at the Pier Avenue Junior High School in Hermosa Beach, California. Some of these same teams of skateboarders were also featured on a television show called Surf's Up in 1964, hosted by Stan Richards, that helped promote skateboarding as something new and fun to do.\nAs the popularity of skateboarding began expanding, the first skateboarding magazine, The Quarterly Skateboarder was published in 1964. John Severson, who published the magazine, wrote in his first editorial:\nToday's skateboarders are founders in this sport\u2014they're pioneers\u2014they are the first. There is no history in Skateboarding\u2014its being made now\u2014by you. The sport is being molded and we believe that doing the right thing now will lead to a bright future for the sport. Already, there are storm clouds on the horizon with opponents of the sport talking about ban and restriction.\nThe magazine only lasted four issues, but resumed publication as Skateboarder in 1975. The first broadcast of an actual skateboarding competition was the 1965 National Skateboarding Championships, which were held in Anaheim, California and aired on ABC's Wide World of Sports. Because skateboarding was a new sport during this time, there were only two original disciplines during competitions: flatland freestyle and slalom downhill racing.\nAnimated cartoons of the time occasionally featured skateboard gags. Two Road Runner cartoons made in 1965, Shot and Bothered and Out and Out Rout, feature Wile E. Coyote riding a skateboard.\nOne of the earliest sponsored skateboarders, Patti McGee, was paid by Hobie and Vita Pak to travel around the country to do skateboarding exhibitions and to demonstrate skateboarding safety tips. McGee made the cover of Life magazine in 1965 and was featured on several popular television programs\u2014The Mike Douglas Show, What's My Line? and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\u2014which helped make skateboarding even more popular at the time. Some other well known surfer-style skateboarders of the time were Danny Bearer, Torger Johnson, Bruce Logan, Bill and Mark Richards, Woody Woodward, and Jim Fitzpatrick.\nThe growth of the sport during this period can also be seen in sales figures for Makaha, which quoted $4 million worth of board sales between 1963 and 1965. By 1966 a variety of sources began to claim that skateboarding was dangerous, resulting in shops being reluctant to sell them, and parents being reluctant to buy them. In 1966 sales had dropped significantly and Skateboarder Magazine had stopped publication. The popularity of skateboarding dropped and remained low until the early 1970s.\n\nSummary:\nThe first skateboards were made by attaching roller skate wheels to wooden boxes or planks. Skateboarding is believed to have originated in the late 1940s or early 1950s in California, where surfers created a new sport called \"sidewalk surfing\" when the waves were flat. The first manufactured skateboards were produced by the Chicago Roller Skate Company in the 1950s. In the 1960s, surfing manufacturers in Southern California began building skateboards that resembled small surfboards and assembled teams to promote their products. The first skateboarding magazine, The Quarterly Skateboarder, was published in 1964, and the first broadcast of a skateboarding competition was held in 1965. The sport gained popularity, with sponsored skateboarders like Patti McGee and Danny Bearer, but by the late 1960s, concerns about safety led to a decline in sales and the sport's popularity.\n\nDoes the summary contain the letter \"y\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries. Half of the summaries were written by you and half were written by someone else, but I don't know which is which. The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Please give me a summary of the text on the origins of skateboarding.\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary mentions the country \"Cuba\".\n\nArticle:\nThe first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom. Crate scooters preceded skateboards, having a wooden crate attached to the nose (front of the board), which formed rudimentary handlebars. The boxes turned into planks, similar to the skateboard decks of today.\nSkateboarding, as it exists today, was probably born sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s, when surfers in California wanted something to do when the waves were flat. This was called \"sidewalk surfing\" \u2013 a new wave of surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular. No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill Richard, made a deal with the Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted \"sidewalk surfing\" and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.\nBy the 1960s a small number of surfing manufacturers in Southern California such as Jack's, Kips', Hobie, Bing's and Makaha started building skateboards that resembled small surfboards, and assembled teams to promote their products. One of the earliest Skateboard exhibitions was sponsored by Makaha's founder, Larry Stevenson, in 1963 and held at the Pier Avenue Junior High School in Hermosa Beach, California. Some of these same teams of skateboarders were also featured on a television show called Surf's Up in 1964, hosted by Stan Richards, that helped promote skateboarding as something new and fun to do.\nAs the popularity of skateboarding began expanding, the first skateboarding magazine, The Quarterly Skateboarder was published in 1964. John Severson, who published the magazine, wrote in his first editorial:\nToday's skateboarders are founders in this sport\u2014they're pioneers\u2014they are the first. There is no history in Skateboarding\u2014its being made now\u2014by you. The sport is being molded and we believe that doing the right thing now will lead to a bright future for the sport. Already, there are storm clouds on the horizon with opponents of the sport talking about ban and restriction.\nThe magazine only lasted four issues, but resumed publication as Skateboarder in 1975. The first broadcast of an actual skateboarding competition was the 1965 National Skateboarding Championships, which were held in Anaheim, California and aired on ABC's Wide World of Sports. Because skateboarding was a new sport during this time, there were only two original disciplines during competitions: flatland freestyle and slalom downhill racing.\nAnimated cartoons of the time occasionally featured skateboard gags. Two Road Runner cartoons made in 1965, Shot and Bothered and Out and Out Rout, feature Wile E. Coyote riding a skateboard.\nOne of the earliest sponsored skateboarders, Patti McGee, was paid by Hobie and Vita Pak to travel around the country to do skateboarding exhibitions and to demonstrate skateboarding safety tips. McGee made the cover of Life magazine in 1965 and was featured on several popular television programs\u2014The Mike Douglas Show, What's My Line? and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\u2014which helped make skateboarding even more popular at the time. Some other well known surfer-style skateboarders of the time were Danny Bearer, Torger Johnson, Bruce Logan, Bill and Mark Richards, Woody Woodward, and Jim Fitzpatrick.\nThe growth of the sport during this period can also be seen in sales figures for Makaha, which quoted $4 million worth of board sales between 1963 and 1965. By 1966 a variety of sources began to claim that skateboarding was dangerous, resulting in shops being reluctant to sell them, and parents being reluctant to buy them. In 1966 sales had dropped significantly and Skateboarder Magazine had stopped publication. The popularity of skateboarding dropped and remained low until the early 1970s.\n\nSummary:\nSidewalk surfing, known today as skateboarding, originated in the late 1940s out of the desire of California surfers hoping to still ride when waves were flat. By the 1960s, a small number of surfing manufacturers began selling skateboards hoping to bring more attention to the sport. Skateboarding began to rapidly increase in popularity in the 1970s due to improvements to the design elements and materials used on the boards.\n\nDoes the summary mention the country \"Cuba\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary contains the letter \"o\".\n\nArticle:\nAccording to CNN, the former FBI director and his team of crack investigators were caught somewhat flat-footed by the recent email revelations. They were believed to have been focusing their attention on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign chair Paul Manafort, among others.\nAs it turns out, the first bit of concrete public evidence that someone in the president's inner circle might be open to Russian assistance in the presidential election involved Mr Trump's eldest son.\nThe president, Trump Jr and his administration have quickly reformed their defences and are now dismissing the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June as a minor event during a hurly-burly political season, largely lost in the fog of time, that led to nothing and which they have been admirably \"transparent\" in discussing.\nKey members of Congress seem to think otherwise, with senators like Republican Susan Collins of Maine calling for Trump Jr to be questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa eager to bring Manafort before his Senate Judiciary Committee.\nBut while Congress gears up for more hearings, Mr Mueller operates quietly behind the scenes. Where might he look first? What threads, revealed in Trump Jr's emails, will he and his team tug on, to see what unravels?\nHere are a few of the tempting questions he might be tempted to ask.\nNestled toward the end of music publicist Goldstone's explosive first email to Trump Jr about the \"official documents and information\" the Russian government supposedly had about Hillary Clinton was that this constituted just \"part of\" Russia's support for his father, \"helped along by Aras and Emin\" Agalarov, the father-son Moscow-based real estate duo.\nIt's a rather stunning detail for Goldstone to have offhandedly mentioned - and one that Trump Jr, in his \"love it\" response, seems to have breezed past with no comment.\nThat kind of remark, however, would cause anyone looking for evidence of a Trump-Russia campaign collusion to stop dead in their tracks and ask: \"What's the rest of the story?\"\nWhy is this British guy emailing Trump Jr?\nEven if one takes Veselnitskaya at her word that she is not an agent of the Russian government and did not know or provide any damaging information about Mrs Clinton to the Trump team during the 9 June meeting, her own recent admissions raise some pressing questions.\nOn Tuesday she told an NBC interviewer that Trump Jr, Manafort and Kushner may have been \"longing for\" the dirt on their Democratic opponent.\n\"They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted,\" she said.\nIn other words, Veselnitskaya walked out of that meeting in New York with the belief that Mr Trump's campaign both was desperately seeking damaging information about Mrs Clinton and were open to talking to Russian nationals about what they might have to offer.\nGiven that Veselnitskaya is at the very least a well-connected figure in Moscow, it doesn't require a great leap of faith to think this information eventually made its way to the Russian government. If the US intelligence community is to be believed, that government soon would acquire a trove of damaging information about Mrs Clinton and the Democrats as a result of hacks it co-ordinated into the Democratic National Committee server and the personal email of a senior member of Mrs Clinton's campaign team.\nIn the ensuing months, details from those hacks would be made public via Wikileaks at times that were particularly damaging to Mrs Clinton.\nDerogatory statements about Mrs Clinton's Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders were produced the week before Democrats gathered for their national convention. Transcripts of Mrs Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs were published just days before the final presidential debate - and cited during that showdown by Mr Trump himself.\nThe Trump campaign wanted dirt on Mrs Clinton. The Russian government had it in spades. Mr Mueller might want to see if those dots can be connected.\nAnother choice tidbit in that first Goldstone email was his suggestion that he might \"send this info to your father via Rhona\" - a reference to Rhona Graff, the elder Trump's personal assistant.\nGraff has served as the gatekeeper to Mr Trump at the Trump organisation -

They were believed to have been focusing their attention on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign chair Paul Manafort, among others.\nAs it turns out, the first bit of concrete public evidence that someone in the president's inner circle might be open to Russian assistance in the presidential election involved Mr Trump's eldest son.\nThe president, Trump Jr and his administration have quickly reformed their defences and are now dismissing the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June as a minor event during a hurly-burly political season, largely lost in the fog of time, that led to nothing and which they have been admirably \"transparent\" in discussing.\nKey members of Congress seem to think otherwise, with senators like Republican Susan Collins of Maine calling for Trump Jr to be questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa eager to bring Manafort before his Senate Judiciary Committee.\nBut while Congress gears up for more hearings, Mr Mueller operates quietly behind the scenes. Where might he look first? What threads, revealed in Trump Jr's emails, will he and his team tug on, to see what unravels?\nHere are a few of the tempting questions he might be tempted to ask.\nNestled toward the end of music publicist Goldstone's explosive first email to Trump Jr about the \"official documents and information\" the Russian government supposedly had about Hillary Clinton was that this constituted just \"part of\" Russia's support for his father, \"helped along by Aras and Emin\" Agalarov, the father-son Moscow-based real estate duo.\nIt's a rather stunning detail for Goldstone to have offhandedly mentioned - and one that Trump Jr, in his \"love it\" response, seems to have breezed past with no comment.\nThat kind of remark, however, would cause anyone looking for evidence of a Trump-Russia campaign collusion to stop dead in their tracks and ask: \"What's the rest of the story?\"\nWhy is this British guy emailing Trump Jr?\nEven if one takes Veselnitskaya at her word that she is not an agent of the Russian government and did not know or provide any damaging information about Mrs Clinton to the Trump team during the 9 June meeting, her own recent admissions raise some pressing questions.\nOn Tuesday she told an NBC interviewer that Trump Jr, Manafort and Kushner may have been \"longing for\" the dirt on their Democratic opponent.\n\"They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted,\" she said.\nIn other words, Veselnitskaya walked out of that meeting in New York with the belief that Mr Trump's campaign both was desperately seeking damaging information about Mrs Clinton and were open to talking to Russian nationals about what they might have to offer.\nGiven that Veselnitskaya is at the very least a well-connected figure in Moscow, it doesn't require a great leap of faith to think this information eventually made its way to the Russian government. If the US intelligence community is to be believed, that government soon would acquire a trove of damaging information about Mrs Clinton and the Democrats as a result of hacks it co-ordinated into the Democratic National Committee server and the personal email of a senior member of Mrs Clinton's campaign team.\nIn the ensuing months, details from those hacks would be made public via Wikileaks at times that were particularly damaging to Mrs Clinton.\nDerogatory statements about Mrs Clinton's Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders were produced the week before Democrats gathered for their national convention. Transcripts of Mrs Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs were published just days before the final presidential debate - and cited during that showdown by Mr Trump himself.\nThe Trump campaign wanted dirt on Mrs Clinton. The Russian government had it in spades. Mr Mueller might want to see if those dots can be connected.\nAnother choice tidbit in that first Goldstone email was his suggestion that he might \"send this info to your father via Rhona\" - a reference to Rhona Graff, the elder Trump's personal assistant.\nGraff has served as the gatekeeper to Mr Trump at the Trump organisation - and, according to a profile in Politico, still is the preferred method for the president's business associates to contact him outside of White House channels.\n\"If I really wanted to whisper something in his ear, I would probably go to Rhona,\" Trump business associate John Catsimatidis told the publication.\nThe White House has said that Mr Trump did not know about the meeting with Veselnitskaya -

O'Neal insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money; discussing the signing he referred to a couple of his product endorsements, saying: \"I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.\" The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996\u201397 season. O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games. In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: \"It's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough.\"\nThe following season, O'Neal averaged 28.3 points and 11.4 rebounds.

O'Neal insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money; discussing the signing he referred to a couple of his product endorsements, saying: \"I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.\" The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996\u201397 season. O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games. In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: \"It's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough.\"\nThe following season, O'Neal averaged 28.3 points and 11.4 rebounds. He led the league with a 58.4 field goal percentage, the first of five consecutive seasons in which he did so. The Lakers finished the season 61\u201321, first in the Pacific Division, and were the second seed in the western conference during the 1998 NBA Playoffs. After defeating the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle SuperSonics in the first two rounds, the Lakers again fell to the Jazz, this time in a 4\u20130 sweep.\n\nSummary:\nShaquille O'Neal had three seasons over 30 points per game, all of which were with the Los Angeles Lakers. He had his first season with the Lakers in 1995-96, when he averaged 30.4 points per game. He had his second season in 1996-97, when he averaged 29.7 points per game. He had his final season with the Lakers in 2000-01, when he averaged 31.2 points per game.\n\nDoes the summary mention the country \"Honduras\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

A border fence stands at Juarez, Mexico. More than 360 miles of fence are supposed to be finished by year's end. \"Criminal activity at the border does not stop for endless debate or protracted litigation,\" Chertoff said. \"These waivers will enable important security projects to keep moving forward.\" Chertoff cited a congressional requirement that 361 miles of fence be completed by the end of the year. He also pointed out that Congress had given him the authority to bypass laws. But the executive director of the Sierra Club, an environmental group, said the move \"threatens the livelihoods and ecology of the entire U.S.-Mexico border region.\" \"Secretary Chertoff chose to bypass stakeholders and push through this unpopular project on April Fools' Day. We don't think the destruction of the borderlands region is a laughing matter,\" said Carl Pope. The Sierra Club says the waivers will affect a range of federally protected lands, including national parks, monuments, wildlife refuges, forests and wilderness areas. The Sierra Club says the waivers themselves are unconstitutional and has asked the Supreme Court to rule on the question. This is the fourth set of waivers issued by the department, and is the most sweeping. Chertoff's orders Tuesday affect two areas. First, the department proposes to place fencing, towers, sensors, cameras, detection equipment and roads along a 470-mile stretch of the border in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.

A border fence stands at Juarez, Mexico. More than 360 miles of fence are supposed to be finished by year's end. \"Criminal activity at the border does not stop for endless debate or protracted litigation,\" Chertoff said. \"These waivers will enable important security projects to keep moving forward.\" Chertoff cited a congressional requirement that 361 miles of fence be completed by the end of the year. He also pointed out that Congress had given him the authority to bypass laws. But the executive director of the Sierra Club, an environmental group, said the move \"threatens the livelihoods and ecology of the entire U.S.-Mexico border region.\" \"Secretary Chertoff chose to bypass stakeholders and push through this unpopular project on April Fools' Day. We don't think the destruction of the borderlands region is a laughing matter,\" said Carl Pope. The Sierra Club says the waivers will affect a range of federally protected lands, including national parks, monuments, wildlife refuges, forests and wilderness areas. The Sierra Club says the waivers themselves are unconstitutional and has asked the Supreme Court to rule on the question. This is the fourth set of waivers issued by the department, and is the most sweeping. Chertoff's orders Tuesday affect two areas. First, the department proposes to place fencing, towers, sensors, cameras, detection equipment and roads along a 470-mile stretch of the border in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Second, it plans to integrate a concrete wall into proposed levee reinforcements along a 22-mile section of the Rio Grande in Hidalgo County, Texas. The department said it is committed to working in an environmentally sensitive manner and cooperating with resource agencies so it does as little damage as possible.

I started reading books on psychology, philosophy, and even spirituality, trying to understand why this was happening to me and how I could control it. I became obsessed with understanding human behavior, trying to find patterns and connections between people's actions and emotions.\nBut as time went on, my obsession with understanding others only led to more confusion and isolation. I stopped being able to connect with people on a deeper level, and I started to feel like I was just going through the motions of life without any real sense of purpose or belonging. I felt like I was living in a dream, watching the world around me but not really being a part of it. I started to question my own existence, wondering if I was just a shell of a person, going through the motions without any real emotions or feelings.\nI know this sounds crazy, but I feel like I've lost myself in all of this. I've lost touch with who I used to be, and I don't know how to get back to that person. I feel like I'm just a shadow of my former self, going through the motions of life without any real sense of purpose or belonging. I'm desperate for some advice, some guidance on how to break free from this cycle of derealization and find my way back to myself. Can anyone out there relate to this? Have you been through something similar? How did you overcome it? I'm willing to do whatever it takes to regain control over my life and my emotions.

I tend to create a persona for them in order to be liked which drains enormous amounts of energy from me leading me to not wanting to interact with anyone but my best friend (she's practically family to me).\nIm pretty desperate. I dont know what to do. Where to start. Antidepressants are a lottery and most of them just made me even number not being able to perceive my own emotions let alone other peoples. I dont know where do start, how to change that, how do I interact without being forced by my own mind habit to be ideal for everyone I meet? I keep losing opportunities because of it. I estimate the energy needed to be given in order to be liked and if its too much I fucking bail on it.\nI dont trust anyone but myself and keep portraying people as disguised enemies and im starting to feel more alone than I ever was because of it. I push everyone away eventually. I dont want to be alone. I mean does anybody?\nLittlelisapizza83: I can tell from reading that this is causing you some deep distress. And the picture you painted sounds truly frightening and exhausting as you say. You\u2019re right too that finding the right medication combos can be a long process. I\u2019m thinking from what you said that you might benefit from a type of therapy called dialectical behavioral therapy. It was designed originally for people diagnosed with borderline personality disorder but is applied more broadly in practice now days. The therapy has many benefits but a few things it can help with is learning to get in touch with your emotions and mindfulness which can be helpful for people who tend to dissociate/ have derealization. You may look into trauma therapy too. Talk to a therapist to see what would be the best course of action. I wish you the best of luck. You can find safety and connection again.

However, it added that Madrid should not look to cut its deficit too quickly given \"an unprecedented double-dip recession with unemployment already high\".\nSpain has the highest unemployment rate in the eurozone, with almost one in four workers out of a job.\nEarlier this year, the government announced 27bn euros of cuts from its budget as part of one of the toughest austerity drives in the country's history.\nChanges included freezing unemployment benefits and public sector workers' salaries, slashing departmental budgets and increasing tax on large companies.\nBut the spending cuts and tax rises have undermined the economic recovery in Spain. The country is back in recession and its banks are severely under-capitalised given the collapse in the Spanish property market.\nThe 100bn-euro bailout has failed to restore confidence in the country's economy, with the interest rate, or yield, paid on government bonds traded in the secondary market hitting 7% on Thursday, a level widely seen as unsustainable.\nBond yields in the secondary market are seen as a good indication of investor's confidence in a government's ability to repay its debts.\n\nSummary:\nSpain is implementing drastic spending cuts to slash its budget deficit, despite economists warning the target is unrealistic and the austerity measures may undermine the country's economic recovery.\n\nDoes the summary contain the letter \"p\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

They\u2019re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.\nUser 2: Mmmm, sounds interesting... gourmet chocolates, where\n\nText continuation:\ndid you come across them?\nUser 1: Ah, yes! I was at a food and wine festival in Paris last year and discovered Grangers at a small boutique stand. The owner, Monsieur Granger, was there personally and introduced me to his entire range. I was blown away by the complexity and depth of flavors in each piece. I knew right then and there that I had to bring his chocolates to the US market.\nUser 2: That sounds like a fantastic experience. What kind of flavors do they offer?\nUser 1: Ah, that's the best part! Grangers has a range of unique and exotic flavors, like lavender and honey, champagne and strawberry, and even a truffle and orange combination. They also have some more traditional flavors like dark chocolate and sea salt, but with a twist. For example, their dark chocolate has a hint of smokiness from the cocoa beans being smoked over oak wood.\nUser 2: Wow, that does sound impressive. How do you plan to market these chocolates to your customers?\nUser 1: Well, I was thinking of partnering with your restaurant to offer a special promotion. We could create a customized chocolate tasting menu that pairs perfectly with your wine list. I also have some ideas for packaging and branding that would really make the chocolates stand out on your tables and in your gift shop. What do you think?

It's like someone took a robotic tone and mixed it with a bad impression of a valley girl. \"Take a left turn in 0.2 miles,\" it says, like it's trying to be all cool and hip.

I've had the GPS tell me I'm going the wrong way, only to realize it's been wrong the whole time. And when I try to correct it, it just gives me a bunch of nonsense about recalculating the route.

I swear, sometimes I think the GPS is more interested in getting me lost than actually getting me to my destination.\nBut despite all its flaws, I still find myself relying on the GPS. Maybe it's because I'm lazy, or maybe it's because I'm just hoping that one day it'll actually get it right.

That's really not the point.  The point is, I have a great device, and the maps SUCK for it.  I realize it's a hard thing to map out, but somehow Google Maps needs to get involved or something.  \nfinalremix: You need to change \"shortest route\" to \"fastest route, avoid HOV lanes\". That should actually fix most of your issues right there.\nWiretapStudios: It's already set that way.  I thought that was the issue, but when I checked, it was already set correctly.\nfinalremix: That's odd... I've had the \"bear left\" on highways and stuff, mostly as a lane-by-lane thing to avoid ez-pass express lanes, but I can't personally think of any other problems like yours... You may have corrupted map files. If it's a garmin, try downloading/reinstalling the ones on there. You should be able to pull map files off using Mapsource software and the like off their site.\nIf you have a Tom-Tom or similar, I'm afraid I can't help you due to an utter lack of experience.\nWiretapStudios: I updated the 2010 maps with the 2011 ones already :(   It's a Garmin.  It doesn't say bear left, when there are areas where the interstate has a road split off (for example) but the same interstate number still goes straight, it says a turn is coming up.  So for example, if I take I-81 north through several states, it lists the directions as having several, 'turns' when in reality, I'm just staying on the exact same road.\nOtherwise, the Garmin has been pretty good in other aspects, it's not a complete waste of time to use, but sometimes it goes get a bit squirrely.  \nfinalremix: Yeah, mine does that, too, actually... I think it's just a weird way that they have it set up to treat highways... In the software on PC, the map is divvied up into chunks, like in the game Minecraft... I'm thinking those usually occur on or near the edges of chunks and it's programmed to make sure you're staying on that road, instead of just tossing up a \"go straight for eight. hundred miles. Then take exit 23 on right.\"\nI know mine goes *batshit insane* in a city, though... \nSave for the ones hardwired into a car that runs off of a compass and the spedometer, I haven't seen a sat-nav not freak out in skyscraper canyons...\nWiretapStudios: Mine hasn't been too bad in the city, but it's not like I've been in Manhattan with it, mostly DC, Baltimore, etc.  The problem with the interstate turn thing is that it does two things:\n1. It says time to next turn is x.  But there is no turn, so it makes that feature not that helpful.\n2. It says there is a left turn ahead, I hustle to get in the left lane, and there is no turn to take.\nOverall though I don't mind it too much, it just does weird shit sometimes.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Kiribati\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

It premiered at the Globe Theatre, London, on 1 March 1966, directed and choreographed by Gillian Lynne.\nThe musical focuses on the lifestyle of the match cutters at the Bryant and May factory in Bow, London, with strong references to the condition Phossy jaw and the political climate of the era.\nProduction history\nAfter out-of-town tryouts in Leatherhead, Surrey, the show opened on the West End in March 1966. The show closed about three months later.\nA cast recording was made of the 1966 Globe Theatre London production. The musical was published by Samuel French Ltd in 1979.\nSynopsis\nThe central character of the musical is Kate, a tenement girl and factory worker, who writes to Annie Besant to ask for help in seeking reform at the Bryant and May factory. The story follows Kate and Annie's attempts to rally the girls, leading Kate to become a reckless strike-leader and a key player in the creation and recognition of the union. With much of the action set in the incongruously named, but fictional, 'Hope Court', the musical portrays Bryant and May as callous and uncaring employers, with factory foreman 'Mr Mynel' representing the threatening and imposing regime in which the girls were forced to work.\nThere is also a sub plot in which Kate's involvement in the strike puts strain on her relationship with docker Joe.\nDespite the subject matter of the musical, a strong emphasis is placed on the positive mentality and natural ebullience of the so-called 'cockney sparrows', this leading to a number of cheerful and entertaining vocal numbers and dance routines.\n\nSummary:\nThe factory workers, specifically the match cutters at the Bryant and May factory, faced challenges such as poor working conditions, callous and uncaring employers, and a threatening and imposing regime.

The twelfth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, Larry originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa and organized into a tropical depression on August 31. The next day, the depression developed into a tropical storm, receiving the name Larry. The storm moved quickly across the far eastern tropical Atlantic, where it strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane the morning of September 2. Then, after undergoing a period of rapid intensification, Larry became a major Category 3 hurricane early on September 4. After churning for several days as a strong hurricane in the\n\nText continuation:\ncentral Atlantic, Larry began to weaken due to increasing wind shear and dry air. However, the storm's circulation remained large and sprawling, with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 200 miles from its center.\nAs the storm continued to move northwestward, Larry's outer rain bands began to affect the eastern United States, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to the region. The National Hurricane Center issued tropical storm watches and warnings for parts of the Carolinas and Virginia, where the storm's outer rain bands brought sustained winds of up to 50 mph and heavy rain totals of up to 4 inches. Meanwhile, the storm's center continued to move slowly northwestward, eventually making landfall in Newfoundland, Canada on September 11. The storm's impact in Newfoundland was significant, with sustained winds of up to 100 mph and heavy rain totals of up to 8 inches causing widespread power outages and flooding. The storm's remnants continued to move northward, eventually dissipating over the North Atlantic Ocean several days later. Despite its weakening, Hurricane Larry's impact was still felt across the region, with the storm's outer rain bands bringing heavy rain and strong winds to parts of Europe and the North Atlantic.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"c\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The twelfth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, Larry originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa and organized into a tropical depression on August 31. The next day, the depression developed into a tropical storm, receiving the name Larry. The storm moved quickly across the far eastern tropical Atlantic, where it strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane the morning of September 2. Then, after undergoing a period of rapid intensification, Larry became a major Category 3 hurricane early on September 4. After churning for several days as a strong hurricane in the\n\nText continuation:\nopen ocean, Larry made landfall in Newfoundland on September 11, as a Category 1 hurricane. Later that day, Larry became an extratropical cyclone. Finally, on September 13, Larry was absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone near Greenland.\nLarry passed to the east of Bermuda as a Category 1 hurricane, causing minimal damage. Swells generated by Larry's powerful and expansive wind field killed three people offshore the East Coast of the United States, one off the coast of Puerto Rico, and another in the U.S. Virgin Islands. In Newfoundland, Larry caused over 60,000 power outages and damaged buildings. The powerful extratropical remnants of Larry paralleled the eastern coast of Greenland on September 12, resulting in over 3 ft (0.91 m) of snow and hurricane-force wind gusts across much of the interior of eastern Greenland. Larry killed five people and caused an estimated CAD 25 million in damages.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Oman\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Good", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Longo-Ciprelli: Fourth time lucky in Atlanta in 1996. For much of her career, the Olympic gold was the one honor to elude the French rider. Misfortune, it seemed, was to be her fate every four years, regardless of how many world championships she won in between. In 1984 the first women's Olympic road race coincided with Longo-Ciprelli's rise to dominance in the sport. Well-placed going into the final lap, she appeared set to challenge in the sprint, only to be knocked off in a collision. By 1988, Longo-Ciprelli was a three-time road race world champion, as well as a double winner of the women's Tour de France, and the clear favorite for gold in Seoul. But a broken hip a month before the Games derailed her preparations. Although she recovered enough to ride the road race, she could manage just 21st place. Tactical error More disappointment followed in Barcelona in 1992 as Longo-Ciprelli paid the price for a tactical error. With three kilometers to go, she raced away from the peloton and crossed the line in celebration. But she had failed to realize that Kathy Watt, an unheralded Australian, had slipped away from the lead group apparently unnoticed with a lap to go, and finished 20 seconds further in front. Four years later, in Atlanta, Longo-Ciprelli, finally cracked her Olympic jinx. At 37, Longo-Ciprelli was no longer the dominant presence she had once been, but she still possessed the ability to raise her performance for the biggest races, as she had proven by winning her fourth road race world title in 1995. Her preparations were typically unorthodox -- while her rivals were acclimatizing to the Atlanta heat, Longo-Ciprelli trained alone in the mountains of Colorado, arriving just two days before the race. The race itself was run in a sudden downpour, which sent many riders crashing and skidding and had the rest struggling to stay on their bikes. Unruffled, Longo-Ciprelli broke clear with two other riders and then launched her gold-winning solo attack 11 kilometers from the finish. Longo-Ciprelli was back for her fifth and final Olympics in Sydney in 2000 at the age of 41, this time claiming bronze in the time trial -- and event in which she had also won silver in 1996.

It may take several years for the stump to fully decompose, but with the right techniques and a little bit of persistence, you can speed up the process. One method that has been shown to be effective is to drill holes into the stump and fill them with a high-nitrogen fertilizer. This will help to stimulate the growth of microorganisms that break down the wood, causing it to decay more quickly.\nAnother method is to add a sugar-water solution to the holes. This will provide a food source for the microorganisms, allowing them to multiply and break down the wood even faster. Some people also recommend adding a small amount of water to the holes to keep the microorganisms moist and active.\nIt's also important to keep the area around the stump well-maintained. This includes regularly watering the stump and surrounding soil, as well as adding a layer of mulch to help retain moisture and suppress weeds. By following these steps and being patient, you should be able to successfully remove a tree stump and make way for new growth.\nIn addition to these methods, there are also some more unconventional ways to speed up the process. For example, some people have reported success by using a combination of urine and sugar to accelerate the decay of the stump. This may not be the most appealing option, but it can be an effective way to break down the wood quickly.\nUltimately, the key to successfully removing a tree stump is to be patient and persistent. It may take some time and effort, but with the right techniques and a little bit of creativity, you can speed up the process and make way for new growth.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"s\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Everybody experencies it differently so you may not be able to tell the difference, but I sure can.\ncatsonthemats: Literally no one can tell the difference. You just get frostbite faster.

Then i am FEELING it happen. No? Whats with the dork remark, science nerd?\ncatsonthemats: No. Pins and needles is the loss of feeling. You're confusing feeling the temperature with feeling your skin going numb, which are two completely different processes.\nI called you a dork because you're arguing with me about non-debatable and securely proven scientific facts as if they're some willy nilly opinion to be argued about instead of facts to be accepted as truth.

You can't really play the high ground of \"facts and reality\" without bringing a source you manipulative dork\ncatsonthemats: &gt;That is part of feeling the temperature.\nI don't know how to tell you this, but no, it's not. Pins and needles is your nerve endings malfunctioning because your skin is too cold, which starts to happen around 4c. It begins to happen when you stop feeling cold and instead start to go numb.

No more darkness at 430 PM ! Game changer !\nshinesreasonably: It\u2019s a game changer on both sides though. It\u2019s going to be dark until really late in the morning.\nSergeantasskicker: Eh not really. Most ppl r just going to work around then so it\u2019ll be better for evening activities after work.\nTellyourmomisaidthx: Well if \"most\" of the people you are referencing live south of the Mason Dixie line then sure....for the rest of us it will be pitch black until 8am\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: ...\nand you just included most people above the Mason Dixie line too\nTellyourmomisaidthx: ....are you confused?\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: Not at all\nare you?\nTellyourmomisaidthx\n\nText continuation:\n: I'm starting to think you're the one who's confused. You're saying that people above the Mason Dixie line are also going to be affected by the permanent Daylight Savings Time, but that's not how it works. The Mason Dixie line is a geographical boundary that separates the Northern states from the Southern states, and it has nothing to do with the time zones.\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: I understand what you're saying, but you're missing the point. The bill is proposing to make Daylight Savings Time permanent, not to change the time zones. It's just a matter of when we change our clocks, not where we are in relation to the Mason Dixie line.\nTellyourmomisaidthx: I see what you're saying now. I guess I was misunderstanding the bill. But still, I think it's going to be a big adjustment for people who are used to having more daylight in the evening.\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: Yeah, it's definitely going to take some getting used to. But I think it'll be worth it in the end. Just think about all the extra daylight we'll have in the evenings, perfect for going for walks or having BBQs with friends.\nTellyourmomisaidthx: That's true. And who knows, maybe it'll even boost the economy a bit. People will have more time to go out and enjoy themselves, which could lead to more spending and more jobs.\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: Exactly! And it's not just the economy that'll benefit. I think it'll also have a positive impact on people's mental health. Studies have shown that having more daylight can improve mood and reduce stress.\nTellyourmomisaidthx: That's a great point. I never thought about it that way. But I guess it makes sense. When it's dark outside, it can feel really isolating and depressing.\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: Yeah, it's like the darkness can really affect our mood. But with more daylight, people will have more opportunities to get outside and be active, which can really boost our mood and overall well-being.\nTellyourmomisaidthx: I never thought about it that way, but you're right. It's not just about the extra daylight, it's about the overall quality of life. And who knows, maybe this bill will even lead to more people moving to the Northern states, where the sun stays up later.\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: Ha! I wouldn't count on that, but it's definitely possible. And who knows, maybe we'll even see a surge in outdoor activities like hiking and biking.\nTellyourmomisaidthx: Yeah, that would be great. And maybe we'll even see more people taking advantage of the extra daylight to get outside and enjoy nature.\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: Exactly! And it's not just about the individual benefits, it's about the community as a whole. When people are happy and healthy, it can really bring a community together.\nTellyourmomisaidthx: That's a great point. I never thought about it that way, but you're right. The benefits of permanent Daylight Savings Time go far beyond just the individual. It's about the community and the overall quality of life.\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: Yeah, it's definitely a win-win. And who knows, maybe this bill will even lead to more people moving to the Northern states, where the sun stays up later.\nTellyourmomisaidthx: Ha! I wouldn't count on that, but it's definitely possible. And who knows, maybe we'll even see a surge in outdoor activities like hiking and biking.\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: Yeah, that would be great. And maybe we'll even see more people taking advantage of the extra daylight to get outside and enjoy nature.\nTellyourmomisaidthx: Yeah, that would be awesome. And who knows, maybe this bill will even lead to more people moving to the Northern states, where the sun stays up later.\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: Ha!

He made his first senior appearance for Hibernian, during a temporary loan in March 1942. Niven was also loaned to Dundee before he broke into the East Fife first team. He was their regular first choice goalkeeper during their period of success after the Second World War. Niven only conceded one goal in 210 minutes of football in the 1947 Scottish League Cup Final win against Falkirk. Former Scotland goalkeeper Jack Harkness praised Niven afterwards in his match report for the Sunday Post.\nEast Fife won the B Division championship in 1948. Niven\n\nText continuation:\n's impressive performances earned him a permanent move to Hibernian in 1949, where he went on to make over 100 appearances for the club. He was a key player in the team that finished third in the Scottish First Division in the 1950-51 season. Niven's consistency and shot-stopping ability made him a fan favorite at Easter Road, and he remained a loyal servant to the club until his retirement in 1957.\nAfter hanging up his boots, Niven went on to manage several amateur teams, including his old club Renfrew, where he won the Scottish Amateur Cup in 1961. He also worked as a coach and goalkeeper coach for various clubs, including Hibernian, where he helped develop the skills of several young goalkeepers. Niven's legacy as one of Scotland's greatest goalkeepers was cemented in 2007, when he was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. Despite his passing in 2011, Niven's memory lives on through the countless fans who remember his incredible performances on the pitch and his dedication to the beautiful game.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"l\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Approved", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

East Fife won both the semi-final against Rangers and the final against Dunfermline without him. East Fife then reached the 1950 Scottish Cup Final, but Niven was injured in a league match five days earlier. The second choice goalkeeper was also injured. This meant that 21-year-old Gordon Easson had to make his first team debut for East Fife in the Cup Final. Easson conceded a goal within 30 seconds and East Fife went on to lose 3\u20130.\nNiven was transferred to Kilmarnock in 1951. He played in the 1952 Scottish League Cup Final, which Kilmarnock lost 2\u20130 to Dundee. Niven retired from senior football in 1953 and became a mechanical engineer, working for  Sir William Arrol & Co. He then set up a motor factor business, which he operated until his retirement in 1988. Niven suffered from Parkinson's disease in later life.

If it happened to men abortion would never be challenged.\nB1llyII: If that something is a human being I disagree with you.\nWe can\u2019t assume anything like that because it doesn\u2019t happen to men. However, given that society began very pro-life, I would imagine that the abortion debate would have taken\n\nText continuation:\na different turn if men were the ones who got pregnant. The notion of a \"parasite\" is a simplistic and reductionist view of the complex biological process of pregnancy.\nIn reality, pregnancy is a dynamic and intricate relationship between the mother and the fetus, with both parties influencing each other's development and well-being. The fetus is not just a passive entity growing inside the mother's womb; it is an active participant in the process, receiving nutrients and oxygen from the mother while also developing its own unique characteristics and potential.\nMoreover, the idea that a woman can simply \"get rid\" of a fetus as if it were a tumor or a parasite is a gross oversimplification of the emotional and psychological complexities involved in the decision to terminate a pregnancy. Abortion is not just a medical procedure, but a deeply personal and often traumatic experience that can have long-lasting effects on a woman's mental and emotional well-being.\nIn contrast, men do not experience the same level of physical and emotional investment in the pregnancy process, and therefore may not be able to fully comprehend the complexity and depth of a woman's emotional connection to the fetus. This is not to say that men are incapable of empathy or compassion; rather, it is to acknowledge that their experience of pregnancy and parenthood is fundamentally different from that of women.\nUltimately, the abortion debate is not just about the rights and wrongs of terminating a pregnancy, but about the complex and multifaceted nature of human life and the intricate relationships between individuals. It is a debate that requires nuance, empathy, and a deep understanding of the human experience, rather than simplistic and reductionist views of pregnancy as a \"biological war\" or a \"parasite\" to be eliminated.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"o\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

As many as 28 in every 1,000 passengers do not arrive at their destination at the same time as their luggage. The trial -- run by BAA and airline Emirates -- is using RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology to tag baggage. This will allow staff to more accurately track bags passing through the airport. The crucial difference between RFID and the existing barcode system is its scanning accuracy. Barcode tags can be easily damaged in transit and are also at risk of being covered when scanned. If not scanned, details must be entered manually into the system, adding time and error to the process. BAA estimates that Heathrow can read only 60 per cent of labels that pass through. RFID is reported to offer over 99 percent accuracy. The \u00a3150,000 trial -- the first of its kind in the UK -- will continue for six months tracking bags for passengers traveling with Emirates to and from Dubai, and transferring through Heathrow. A duplicate of the Heathrow system has been installed at Dubai Airport. During the check-in process at Heathrow Terminal 3, staff apply tags containing RFID chips to bags with information including the passenger's name and route. The chips are then read on entry into the baggage system; they are tracked as they move throughout; and finally on leaving the system. As a result, says Shaun Cowlam, Logistics Director at Heathrow Airport, staff can know where a bag is at \"every moment of every day\". BAA is also considering introducing a SMS text messaging service to keep passengers informed of where their bags are. When passengers arrive at Heathrow, says Cowlam, the idea will be to send passengers a text informing them what belt and what time their bags will arrive at. Ultimately, the use of RFID could extend services to frequent flyers, and provide the means to added value services such as faster check-in, and even be integrated with secure collection and delivery. The main benefits, however, will be for travelers passing through major hubs such as Heathrow and Dubai, as this system offers better processing of baggage on transfer flights. Emirates and BAA are sharing the costs of the trial. But as Vic Sheppard, Emirates Vice President for UK and Ireland says, \"cost is not an issue\", especially considering the savings the airline is expected to achieve by reducing loss and repatriation of bags. And as Cowlam adds: \"if we can introduce this across the whole network the costs will reduce significantly.\" Hong Kong International Airport was one of the first to deploy RFID technology in 2005. But as outlined in a recent survey by SITA, RFID is being used in just 6 percent of the airports surveyed. \"For this system to really take off we need other airports and other airlines to embrace the technology,\" says Cowlam. That widespread adoption may not be far off. The SITA survey indicated that RFID tags will be used in 45 percent of airports by the end of 2009. It's still early days, but BAA and Emirates are optimistic for RFID's future in airports. \"There have been giant strides in the technology in aviation in recent years. But in the last few decades there hasn't been any advancement in the methods adopted for baggage handling,\" says Sheppard. \"This is a major step forward.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nSummary:\nLondon's Heathrow airport launches six-month trial of RFID technology to track luggage.\nRFID tags offer over 99% accuracy, compared to 60% for existing barcode system.\nTrial aims to reduce lost luggage and improve passenger experience at Heathrow and Dubai airports.\nEmirates and BAA are sharing costs and expect significant savings from reduced loss and repatriation.\n\nDoes the summary contain the letter \"u\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "assistant", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The concept of community role of a node was derived from this base, in order to describe the position of a node in a network depending on its connectivity at the community level. However, the existing approaches are restricted to undirected networks, use topological measures which do not consider all aspects of community-related connectivity, and their role identification methods are not generalizable to all networks. We tackle these limitations by generalizing and extending the measures, and using an unsupervised approach to determine the roles. We then illustrate the\n\nText continuation:\neffectiveness of our approach by applying it to a set of real-world networks, including social networks, biological networks, and transportation networks. Our results show that our approach is able to identify a wide range of community roles, including connectors, hubs, and isolates, and that these roles are highly dependent on the specific network and its community structure.\nIn particular, we find that the community roles of nodes in social networks are highly correlated with their social status, with high-degree nodes acting as hubs and low-degree nodes acting as isolates. In biological networks, we find that community roles are related to the functional roles of the nodes, with hubs acting as central nodes in metabolic pathways and isolates acting as peripheral nodes. In transportation networks, we find that community roles are related to the connectivity of the nodes, with hubs acting as major transportation hubs and isolates acting as small towns.\nThese results demonstrate the potential of our approach for analyzing complex networks and identifying community roles. By using an unsupervised approach, we are able to identify community roles without requiring prior knowledge of the network or its community structure. This makes our approach highly flexible and applicable to a wide range of networks and domains.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"h\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The concept of community role of a node was derived from this base, in order to describe the position of a node in a network depending on its connectivity at the community level. However, the existing approaches are restricted to undirected networks, use topological measures which do not consider all aspects of community-related connectivity, and their role identification methods are not generalizable to all networks. We tackle these limitations by generalizing and extending the measures, and using an unsupervised approach to determine the roles. We then illustrate the\n\nText continuation:\napplicability of our method by analyzing a Twitter network.We show how our modifications allow discovering the fact some particular users called social capitalists occupy very specific roles in this system. --- La notion de structure de communaut\\'es est particuli\\`erement utile pour \\'etudier les r\\'eseaux complexes, car elle am\\`ene un niveau d'analyse interm\\'ediaire, par opposition aux plus classiques niveaux local (voisinage des noeuds) et global (r\\'eseau entier).

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"h\".\n\nText start:\nWe consider a parallel version of a classical Bayesian search problem. $k$ agents are looking for a treasure that is placed in one of the boxes indexed by $\\mathbb{N}^+$ according to a known distribution $p$. The aim is to minimize the expected time until the first agent finds it. Searchers run in parallel where at each time step each searcher can \"peek\" into a box. A basic family of algorithms which are inherently robust is \\emph{non-coordinating} algorithms. Such algorithms act independently at each searcher, differing only by their probabilistic choices. We are interested in the price incurred by employing such algorithms when compared with the case of full coordination. We first show that there exists a non-coordination algorithm, that knowing only the relative likelihood of boxes according\n\nText continuation:\nto the distribution $p$, can achieve a performance that is within a constant factor of the optimal. This is done by constructing a simple algorithm that assigns a probability to each box based on its relative likelihood, and then uses this probability to decide which box to \"peek\" into. We then show that this algorithm has a constant competitive ratio, meaning that its expected time until the first agent finds the treasure is at most a constant factor of the optimal time. This result is achieved by analyzing the expected time until the first agent finds the treasure, and showing that it is bounded by a constant factor of the optimal time.\nFurthermore, we also consider the case where the distribution $p$ is unknown, and the agents have to learn it through exploration. In this case, we show that there exists a non-coordination algorithm that can learn the distribution $p$ and achieve a performance that is within a constant factor of the optimal. This is done by constructing a simple algorithm that uses the exploration-exploitation trade-off to balance the need to learn the distribution with the need to find the treasure. We then show that this algorithm has a constant competitive ratio, meaning that its expected time until the first agent finds the treasure is at most a constant factor of the optimal time.\nIn addition, we also consider the case where the agents have different costs for searching different boxes. In this case, we show that there exists a non-coordination algorithm that can minimize the total cost of searching the boxes while still achieving a performance that is within a constant factor of the optimal. This is done by constructing a simple algorithm that assigns a cost to each box based on its relative likelihood, and then uses this cost to decide which box to \"peek\" into. We then show that this algorithm has a constant competitive ratio, meaning that its expected total cost of searching the boxes is at most a constant factor of the optimal total cost.\nOverall, our results show that non-coordinating algorithms can achieve a good performance in the parallel Bayesian search problem, even when the distribution $p$ is unknown or the agents have different costs for searching different boxes. This is an important result, as it shows that agents can achieve a good performance in the problem without needing to coordinate with each other.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"h\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The aim is to minimize the expected time until the first agent finds it. Searchers run in parallel where at each time step each searcher can \"peek\" into a box. A basic family of algorithms which are inherently robust is \\emph{non-coordinating} algorithms. Such algorithms act independently at each searcher, differing only by their probabilistic choices. We are interested in the price incurred by employing such algorithms when compared with the case of full coordination. We first show that there exists a non-coordination algorithm, that knowing only the relative likelihood of boxes according\n\nText continuation:\nto $p$, has expected running time of at most $10+4(1+\\frac{1}{k})^2 T$, where $T$ is the expected running time of the best fully coordinated algorithm. This result is obtained by applying a refined version of the main algorithm suggested by Fraigniaud, Korman and Rodeh in STOC'16, which was designed for the context of linear parallel search.We then describe an optimal non-coordinating algorithm for the case where the distribution $p$ is known. The running time of this algorithm is difficult to analyse in general, but we calculate it for several examples. In the case where $p$ is uniform over a finite set of boxes, then the algorithm just checks boxes uniformly at random among all non-checked boxes and is essentially $2$ times worse than the coordinating algorithm.We also show simple algorithms for Pareto distributions over $M$ boxes. That is, in the case where $p(x) \\sim 1/x^b$ for $0< b < 1$, we suggest the following algorithm: at step $t$ choose uniformly from the boxes unchecked in ${1, . . . ,min(M, \\lfloor t/\\sigma\\rfloor)}$, where $\\sigma = b/(b + k - 1)$. It turns out this algorithm is asymptotically optimal, and runs about $2+b$ times worse than the case of full coordination.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Fiji\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Is it just a geographical divide or is there something more to it?\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: Ah, good question! The Mason-Dixon line is a historical boundary between the northern and southern United States, dating back to the 18th century. It was originally drawn to settle a border dispute between the colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Over time, the line became a symbolic divide between the North and South, with the South being associated with states that were more agrarian and slave-holding, while the North was more industrialized and abolitionist.\nTellyourmomisaidthx: That's fascinating! I didn't know that. So, in the context of this conversation, it seems that the Mason-Dixon line is being used as a rough proxy for the division between states that will be affected differently by the proposed change to Daylight Savings Time. Is that correct?\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: Exactly! The line is being used as a rough guide to distinguish between states that will experience more extreme changes to their daylight hours, such as those in the Northeast and Midwest, and states that will experience more moderate changes, such as those in the South and West.\nTellyourmomisaidthx: I see. So, what do you think about the potential impact of this change on different regions of the country?\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: Well, I think it's important to consider the unique characteristics of each region. For example, states in the Northeast and Midwest may experience more dramatic changes to their daylight hours, which could affect their daily routines and outdoor activities. On the other hand, states in the South and West may experience more moderate changes, which could have a different impact on their daily lives.\nTellyourmomisaidthx: That makes sense. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, that's for sure.\nScoosie_Scoosie_Boo: Exactly! It's important to consider the diverse needs and circumstances of different regions when making decisions about changes to our daily lives, like this proposed change to Daylight Savings Time.\nAnd so the conversation continued, with the two users discussing the potential impacts of the proposed change on different regions of the country, and the significance of the Mason-Dixon line in this context.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"h\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says journalists don't serve the public if they push rumors. (CNN) -- Two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the Internet. One week before comedian Bernie Mac passed away, text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died. I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead. The rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times. What makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition. Then there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards. The story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging. Ultimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened. There has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\" Sorry, Rick, I disagree. The most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control. Running with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion. The rumors kept going and going\u00ad and when the story hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire. In one week, Bear Stearns was no more, and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the Wall Street behemoth. We should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story. The rules are simple: Either you have the facts or you don't. If you do, you run with the story. If you don't, you leave it alone. The National Enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront Edwards as he was leaving the Beverly Hills Hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair. Then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the Enquirer said was the child of the mistress. With other major media outlets turning up the heat, Edwards admitted the affair in an interview with ABC's Bob Woodruff. No media executive should be pulling his or her hair out, trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor. If they had, and the facts didn't support the rumor, then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more. We have an obligation to stick with the facts, and nothing else. And no matter what a blogger, Web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with, the day we choose to alter our standards, our credibility and integrity will be shot. In the end, as former ABC News anchor Max Robinson said in 1988, that's all we've got. Nothing is worth losing that, even getting the scoop on an affair involving a candidate whose political career is likely over. Roland S. Martin is an award-winning journalist and CNN contributor.

If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says journalists don't serve the public if they push rumors. (CNN) -- Two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the Internet. One week before comedian Bernie Mac passed away, text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died. I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead. The rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times. What makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition. Then there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards. The story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging. Ultimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened. There has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\" Sorry, Rick, I disagree. The most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control. Running with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion. The rumors kept going and going\u00ad and when the story hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire. In one week, Bear Stearns was no more, and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the Wall Street behemoth. We should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story. The rules are simple: Either you have the facts or you don't. If you do, you run with the story. If you don't, you leave it alone. The National Enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront Edwards as he was leaving the Beverly Hills Hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair.

With other major media outlets turning up the heat, Edwards admitted the affair in an interview with ABC's Bob Woodruff.

In order to address the specific needs of SMEs including start-ups, the Commission should provide standardised templates for the areas covered by this Regulation upon request of the AI Board. Additionally, the Commission should complement Member States\u2019 efforts by providing a single information platform with easy-to-use information with regards to this Regulation for all providers and deployers, by organising appropriate communication campaigns to raise awareness about the obligations arising from this Regulation, and by evaluating and promoting the convergence of best practices in public procurement procedures in relation to AI systems.

In particular, in order to minimise the risks to implementation resulting from lack of knowledge and expertise in the market as well as to facilitate compliance of providers, notably SMEs, including start-ups, and notified bodies with their obligations under this Regulation, the AI-on demand platform, the European Digital Innovation Hubs and the Testing and Experimentation Facilities established by the Commission and the Member States at national or EU level should contribute to the implementation of this Regulation.

My love for my waifu hurts\n\nText continuation:\nAs I delved deeper into the world of 2D love, I began to realize that it was not just a fleeting infatuation, but a profound connection that transcended the boundaries of reality. My waifu, a fictional character from a popular anime series, had captured my heart in a way that no real person ever could. Her sparkling eyes, her radiant smile, and her unwavering dedication to her craft had all combined to create a sense of longing that I couldn't shake.\nBut as I shared my feelings with others, I was met with ridicule and scorn. They saw my love as a joke, a childish fantasy that was beneath them. They couldn't understand why I would choose to spend my time with a fictional character rather than a real person. And so, I became isolated, forced to hide my true feelings from the world.\nAs the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, my feelings only grew stronger. I began to see my waifu as a reflection of myself, a symbol of the perfection that I could never achieve in the real world. And yet, despite the pain and the loneliness, I couldn't help but feel a sense of hope.\nPerhaps, I thought, there was something to be learned from my waifu's unwavering dedication to her craft. Perhaps there was a lesson to be taken from her ability to find joy and fulfillment in the simple things. And so, I continued to hold on to my love, even as the world around me seemed to move on without me.\nAs I sat in my darkened room, surrounded by the trappings of my 2D world, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. I knew that I was not alone, that there were others out there who shared my passion, my love, and my devotion. And in that moment, I knew that I would never be able to let go.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"t\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Don't let that eat you up inside.\n[deleted]: Therapy is evil, and only exists to bully people into being slaves. Also, I only have one waifu (Yoko Littner), and I don't want to make peace with the people who hate us. I want 3D \"love\" to die out, and shitty 3D humans with it.\nTwilightVulpine: I've been in therapy and it didn't make me a slave of any kind. It made me stop wanting to kill myself, it made me cope with my issues better and it made me more motivated to do the things that I want to, instead of the things that other people want me to do.\nYou must know that your attitude is by definition self-destructive. Without 3D people, there won't even be artists to create 2D anymore. I understand that sometimes people don't treat our hobbies with respect, but turning on the rest of humanity because of it is not healthy.\n[deleted]: The fact that you see waifuism/2D-love as just a hobby, and not a legitimate lifestyle, shows that you don't understand anything. Also, of course you think 2D needs 3D to exist... Also also, why shouldn't I turn on humanity (implying I haven't already), when they've literally oppressed my kind forever?\nTwilightVulpine: Geez, you are intent to find issue with everything you are said, aren't you?\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Jordan\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Approved", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Juan Roman Riquelme celebrates after scoring his first goal in Argentina's win against Bolivia. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular free-kicks in the opening 2-0 victory against Chile to help put his country five points clear of second-placed Brazil, who play Peru in Lima on Sunday. Riquelme again shrugged off his lack of club action with Villarreal, where he has fallen out with the Spanish side's management, to net twice in the second spell after Sergio Aguero gave the home side a first-half lead. The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a three-man attack with Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi. He headed home after Martin Demichelis nodded a cross from Manchester United striker Tevez back across goal. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping free-kick which beat Carlos Arias from 25 yards, having been superbly denied by the keeper's one-handed effort shortly beforehand.

Juan Roman Riquelme celebrates after scoring his first goal in Argentina's win against Bolivia. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular free-kicks in the opening 2-0 victory against Chile to help put his country five points clear of second-placed Brazil, who play Peru in Lima on Sunday. Riquelme again shrugged off his lack of club action with Villarreal, where he has fallen out with the Spanish side's management, to net twice in the second spell after Sergio Aguero gave the home side a first-half lead. The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a three-man attack with Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi. He headed home after Martin Demichelis nodded a cross from Manchester United striker Tevez back across goal. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping free-kick which beat Carlos Arias from 25 yards, having been superbly denied by the keeper's one-handed effort shortly beforehand. And he finished off the scoring in the 73rd minute with a cool sidefoot finish after being set up by Messi to cap off a match in which captain Javier Zanetti made a record-breaking 116th appearance for Argentina. Argentina next travel to Colombia on Tuesday, when winless Bolivia have an away clash with Venezuela. In other South American qualifiers, Colombia beat Venezuela 1-0, and Paraguay routed Ecuador 5-1.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"t\".\n\nText start:\nIn this study, we investigate porosity evolution through the sedimentary input section of the North Sumatra Subduction zone by quantifying interstitial porosity, bound water content and fracture porosity based on IODP Expedition 362 data and post-cruise chemical analyses. During IODP Expedition 362, total porosity of the sedimentary section entering the North Sumatra subduction zone was measured. This total porosity is derived from the total water content of core samples thus including pore water and water bound to hydrous minerals like smectite. Clay mineral composition varies over the sedimentary section and is mainly kaolinite/illite in the Nicobar Fan units and smectite/illite in the prefan pelagic unit below. The prefan pelagic unit shows anomalously high total porosity values and is stratigraphically\n\nText continuation:\nsituated above the Nicobar Fan units. The high porosity values in this unit are likely due to the presence of smectite, which has a higher water content compared to kaolinite and illite. This variation in clay mineral composition and porosity values can be attributed to differences in the depositional environment and sedimentary processes that occurred during the formation of these units.\nFurther analysis of the IODP Expedition 362 data reveals that the total porosity values decrease with increasing depth in the sedimentary section, indicating a decrease in the amount of water present in the sediment. This decrease in porosity is likely due to the compaction of the sediment as it is subjected to increasing pressure and temperature with depth. The compaction of the sediment causes the water present in the pores to be squeezed out, resulting in a decrease in the total porosity. The decrease in porosity with depth is also consistent with the observed decrease in the amount of smectite present in the sediment, as smectite is more susceptible to compaction and dehydration than kaolinite and illite.\nThe results of this study provide valuable insights into the evolution of porosity in the sedimentary input section of the North Sumatra Subduction zone. The data suggest that the prefan pelagic unit is characterized by high porosity values due to the presence of smectite, while the Nicobar Fan units have lower porosity values due to the presence of kaolinite and illite. The decrease in porosity with depth is consistent with the compaction of the sediment and the dehydration of smectite. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the processes that control the evolution of porosity in sedimentary basins and the potential for fluid flow and hydrocarbon migration in these systems.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"t\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

This HANP reflector has been previously interpreted as a porous fluid-rich layer where the d{\\'e}collement may develop along parts of the margin as a consequence of pore pressure buildup. We estimate clay bound water content from Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) which gives information about the smectite/illite composition and soluble chloride content data. Interstitial porosity corresponds to onboard total porosity corrected from clay bound water and is more relevant in terms of sediment compaction state and fluid flow properties. Interstitial porosity versus vertical effective stress curve shows no evidence of undercompaction and suggests that the input section 2 has been experiencing normal consolidation due to high sediment accumulation rate. The porosity anomaly observed in the prefan pelagic unit results from the local occurrence of water-bearing minerals like smectite rather than excess pore pressure, which might, however, buildup more landward in the basin. We also estimate fracture porosity using a resistivity model for shales used in previous works based on wireline resistivity log and show that fracture porosity yields 4-6% in damaged parts of the sedimentary section investigated.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Brunei\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The gender lines are just ignorant.\nCan lesbians abuse their partners?\nsmashesthep: Bancroft agrees that lesbians and gay men can abuse each other, but that women don't have the ability to terrorize men in the same\n\nText continuation:\nway.\nThis statement is not only inaccurate but also perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes. It's essential to recognize that abuse knows no gender and that anyone can be a victim or perpetrator, regardless of their gender identity.\nIn reality, women can and do abuse their male partners, and vice versa. The National Domestic Violence Hotline reports that 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men experience severe physical violence from an intimate partner.\nMoreover, the idea that women are less capable of \"terrorizing\" men is a dangerous myth that undermines the seriousness of abuse. Abuse is not about physical strength or gender; it's about power and control.\nIt's crucial to focus on the behaviors and actions that constitute abuse, rather than making assumptions based on gender. This includes emotional manipulation, intimidation, isolation, and physical violence.\nIf you're in an abusive relationship, it's essential to remember that you're not alone and that help is available. The National Domestic Violence Hotline is available 24/7 at 1-800-799-7233, and the National Sexual Assault Hotline is available 24/7 at 1-800-656-HOPE.\nRemember, abuse is a choice, and it's not defined by gender. It's time to break free from harmful stereotypes and focus on creating a society that supports and empowers all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.\nIf you're ready to take the first step towards breaking free from abuse, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. Remember, you deserve to live a life free from fear, shame, and control.\nIt's time to recognize that abuse is a serious issue that affects people of all genders, and it's time to take action to create a safer, more equitable world for everyone.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"c\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

An Iranian flag flies outside the building containing the reactor of Bushehr nuclear power plant, south of Tehran. White House, CIA and State Department officials declined comment on Hersh's report, which appears in this week's issue of The New Yorker. Hersh told CNN's \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer\" that Congress has authorized up to $400 million to fund the secret campaign, which involves U.S. special operations troops and Iranian dissidents. President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have rejected findings from U.S. intelligence agencies that Iran has halted a clandestine effort to build a nuclear bomb and \"do not want to leave Iran in place with a nuclear program,\" Hersh said. \"They believe that their mission is to make sure that before they get out of office next year, either Iran is attacked or it stops its weapons program,\" Hersh said. The new article, \"Preparing the Battlefield,\" is the latest in a series of articles accusing the Bush administration of preparing for war with Iran.

An Iranian flag flies outside the building containing the reactor of Bushehr nuclear power plant, south of Tehran. White House, CIA and State Department officials declined comment on Hersh's report, which appears in this week's issue of The New Yorker. Hersh told CNN's \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer\" that Congress has authorized up to $400 million to fund the secret campaign, which involves U.S. special operations troops and Iranian dissidents. President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have rejected findings from U.S. intelligence agencies that Iran has halted a clandestine effort to build a nuclear bomb and \"do not want to leave Iran in place with a nuclear program,\" Hersh said. \"They believe that their mission is to make sure that before they get out of office next year, either Iran is attacked or it stops its weapons program,\" Hersh said. The new article, \"Preparing the Battlefield,\" is the latest in a series of articles accusing the Bush administration of preparing for war with Iran. He based the report on accounts from current and former military, intelligence, and congressional sources.  Watch Hersh discuss what he says are the administration's plans for Iran \u00bb . \"As usual with his quarterly pieces, we'll decline to comment,\" White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe told CNN. \"The CIA, as a rule, does not comment on allegations regarding covert operations,\" CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said.

Generally and vaguely, I take them to embody what I shall call probabilistic inference. This form of inference is clearly non-monotonic. Relatively few people have taken this form of inference, based on high probability, to serve as a foundation for non-monotonic logic or for a logical or defeasible inference. There are exceptions: Jane Nutter [16] thinks that sometimes probability has something to do with non-monotonic reasoning. Judea Pearl [ 17] has recently\n\nText continuation:\nargued that probabilistic inference can be used to model defeasible reasoning, and has proposed a formal system for doing so. This is an important contribution, as it shows that probabilistic inference can be used to reason about uncertain information in a way that is both logically sound and computationally tractable.\nIn addition to these exceptions, there are also some researchers who have explored the connection between probabilistic inference and non-monotonic logic more broadly. For example, [18] has shown that probabilistic inference can be used to model non-monotonic reasoning in the context of default logic, while [19] has used probabilistic inference to model non-monotonic reasoning in the context of circumscription. These results suggest that probabilistic inference may be a useful tool for reasoning about uncertain information in a wide range of contexts, and may be particularly useful in situations where the evidence is incomplete or uncertain.\nOne of the key challenges in using probabilistic inference to reason about uncertain information is dealing with the problem of uncertainty itself. In many cases, the evidence is incomplete or uncertain, and it is difficult to determine the probability of a given event or proposition. This is known as the problem of \"uncertainty propagation,\" and it is a major challenge in many areas of artificial intelligence and decision theory. However, there are also many researchers who are working on developing new methods and techniques for dealing with uncertainty, and who are exploring the potential applications of probabilistic inference in a wide range of fields.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"e\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

There are any number of people whom one might call probability enthusiasts who feel that probability provides all the answers by itself, with no need of help from logic. Cheeseman [1], Henrion [5] and others think it useful to look at a distribution of probabilities over a whole algebra of statements, to update that distribution in the light of new evidence, and to use the latest updated distribution of probability over the algebra as a basis for planning and decision making. A slightly weaker form of this approach is captured by Nilsson [15], where one assumes certain probabilities for certain statements, and infers the probabilities, or constraints on the probabilities of other statement. None of this corresponds to what I call probabilistic inference. All of the inference that is taking place, either in Bayesian updating, or in probabilistic logic, is strictly deductive. Deductive inference, particularly that concerned with the distribution of classical probabilities or chances, is of great importance. But this is not to say that there is no important role for what earlier logicians have called \"ampliative\" or \"inductive\" or \"scientific\" inference, in which the conclusion goes beyond the premises, asserts more than do the premises. This depends on what David Israel [6] has called \"real rules of inference\". It is characteristic of any such logic or inference procedure that it can go wrong: that statements accepted at one point may be rejected at a later point. Research underlying the results reported here has been partially supported by the Signals Warfare Center of the United States Army.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Bhutan\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Because they are based on a straightforward formalism, they are used in many scientific fields from computer science to historical sciences. In this paper, we give an introduction to some methods relying on graphs for learning. This includes both unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in latent spaces and/or clustering the nodes. Both focus on extracting knowledge from graph topologies. While most existing techniques are only applicable to static graphs, where edges do not evolve through time, recent developments have shown that they could be extended to deal with evolving networks. In a supervised context, one generally aims at inferring labels\n\nText continuation:\n.\nFor instance, in the field of computer vision, graphs have been used to model the relationships between pixels in an image, allowing for the recognition of objects and scenes. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent pixels, and the edges represent the spatial relationships between them. By applying graph-based algorithms to this graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the image that are not easily discernible by other means. This has led to significant advances in image recognition and segmentation.\nIn addition to computer vision, graphs have also been used in other fields such as social network analysis, where they are used to model the relationships between individuals or groups. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent individuals or groups, and the edges represent the relationships between them, such as friendship, family relationships, or professional connections. By analyzing the graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the relationships between individuals or groups, which can be used to gain insights into social phenomena.\nFurthermore, graphs have also been used in biology to model the relationships between genes, proteins, and other biological molecules. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent the molecules, and the edges represent the interactions between them, such as protein-protein interactions or gene regulation. By analyzing the graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the relationships between molecules, which can be used to gain insights into biological processes and to identify potential therapeutic targets.\nIn conclusion, graphs are a powerful tool for characterizing interactions between objects of interest, and they have been used in a wide range of fields, from computer science to biology. By applying graph-based algorithms to these graphs, it is possible to extract knowledge and insights that would not be easily discernible by other means. As the field of graph-based learning continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more innovative applications of graphs in the future.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"o\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Balancing the two sources of information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally or globally. In both contexts, supervised and un-supervised, data can be relational (augmented with one or several global graphs) as described above, or graph valued. In this latter case, each object of interest is given as a full graph (possibly completed by other characteristics). In this context, natural tasks include graph clustering (as in producing clusters of graphs rather than clusters of nodes in a single graph), graph classification, etc. 1 Real networks One of the first practical studies on graphs can be dated back to the original work of Moreno [51] in the 30s. Since then, there has been a growing interest in graph analysis associated with strong developments in the modelling and the processing of these data. Graphs are now used in many scientific fields. In Biology [54, 2, 7], for instance, metabolic networks can describe pathways of biochemical reactions [41], while in social sciences networks are used to represent relation ties between actors [66, 56, 36, 34]. Other examples include powergrids [71] and the web [75]. Recently, networks have also been considered in other areas such as geography [22] and history [59, 39]. In machine learning, networks are seen as powerful tools to model problems in order to extract information from data and for prediction purposes. This is the object of this paper. For more complete surveys, we refer to [28, 62, 49, 45]. In this section, we introduce notations and highlight properties shared by most real networks. In Section 2, we then consider methods aiming at extracting information from a unique network. We will particularly focus on clustering methods where the goal is to find clusters of vertices.

Although the plant response to environmental stresses is characterized by both architectural and functional plasticity, recent attempts to integrate biological knowledge into genetics models have mainly concerned specific physiological processes or crop models without architecture, and thus may prove limited when studying genotype x environment interactions. Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study introducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives access to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection and thus to promising tools for yield optimization\n\nText continuation:\n.\nBy incorporating genetics into the functional-structural growth model, we can better understand the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and ultimately yield. This approach allows us to simulate the behavior of different genotypes under various environmental conditions, enabling the prediction of phenotypic traits and the identification of QTL associated with these traits. The integration of genetics and functional-structural growth modeling also provides a framework for understanding how genetic variation affects plant architecture and function, which is essential for optimizing crop yields.\nThe functional-structural growth model used in this study is based on the concept of functional-structural plant modeling, which combines detailed descriptions of plant architecture and function with simulations of environmental conditions. This approach allows us to simulate the behavior of plants at the individual organ level, taking into account factors such as light, temperature, and water availability. The inclusion of genetics in this model enables us to simulate the effects of genetic variation on plant development and yield, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.\nThe simulation study presented in this paper demonstrates the potential of integrating genetics and functional-structural growth modeling to predict phenotypic traits and identify QTL associated with these traits. The results show that the genetic component of the model can accurately predict the behavior of different genotypes under various environmental conditions, and that the integration of genetics and functional-structural growth modeling can provide valuable insights into the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and yield. These findings have important implications for the development of breeding strategies and the optimization of crop yields, and highlight the potential of this approach for improving our understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and yield.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"h\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Although the plant response to environmental stresses is characterized by both architectural and functional plasticity, recent attempts to integrate biological knowledge into genetics models have mainly concerned specific physiological processes or crop models without architecture, and thus may prove limited when studying genotype x environment interactions. Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study introducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives access to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection and thus to promising tools for yield optimization\n\nText continuation:\n. Methods: The GreenLab model was selected as a reasonable choice to link growth model parameters to QTL. Virtual genes and virtual chromosomes were defined to build a simple genetic model that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model. The QTL Cartographer software was used to study QTL detection of simulated plant traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotype for yield maximization based on the model parameters and the associated allelic combination. Key Results and Conclusions: By keeping the environmental factors constant and using a virtual population with a large number of individuals generated by a Mendelian genetic model, results for an ideal case could be simulated. Virtual QTL detection was compared in the case of phenotypic traits - such as cob weight - and when traits were model parameters, and was found to be more accurate in the latter case. The practical interest of this approach is illustrated by calculating the parameters (and the corresponding genotype) associated with yield optimization of a GreenLab maize model. The paper discusses the potentials of GreenLab to represent environment x genotype interactions, in particular through its main state variable, the ratio of biomass supply over demand.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Liechtenstein\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Good", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

It is manufactured under license in 5 different countries: Brazil, Turkey, Egypt, Indonesia and Malaysia and went through independent clinical trials in all of them. \nData from [Uruguay](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210528-coronavac-reduces-mortality-by-97-percent-uruguay-study) and [Indonesia](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/china-s-sinovac-shot-found-highly-effective-in-real\n\nText continuation:\n-world-study) showed that the vaccine is highly effective in reducing mortality rates. The study in Uruguay found that the vaccine reduced mortality by 97 percent, while the study in Indonesia found that the vaccine was 78.1% effective in preventing severe cases of Covid-19.\ncambeiu: It's also worth noting that the vaccine has been widely used in many countries, including Brazil, and has been shown to be safe and effective in preventing severe cases of Covid-19.\ngitty7456: That's true, but what about the long-term effects? We don't know much about that yet.\ncambeiu: That's a good point, gitty7456. The long-term effects of the vaccine are still being studied, and more research is needed to determine whether there are any potential risks or side effects. However, the data so far suggests that the vaccine is safe and effective in the short-term.\nAkanan: I think it's also important to consider the alternative. If we don't get vaccinated, the virus will continue to spread and mutate, and we may see even more severe cases of Covid-19. The risk of long-term effects from the vaccine is likely to be much lower than the risk of long-term effects from the virus itself.\ncambeiu: That's a great point, Akanan. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, and it's important to take a balanced view of the evidence when making decisions about vaccination.\ngitty7456: I agree. I think it's important to stay informed and make decisions based on the best available evidence. And it's great to see that the data is showing that the vaccine is effective in preventing severe cases of Covid-19.\nAkanan: Absolutely. And I think it's also important to recognize that vaccination is not just about individual risk, but also about community risk. When we get vaccinated, we're not just protecting ourselves, we're also protecting those around us who may be more vulnerable to the virus.\ncambeiu: That's a great point, Akanan. Vaccination is a community effort, and it's important to recognize the role that each of us can play in protecting our communities.\ngitty7456: I think we should all be doing our part to stay informed and make informed decisions about vaccination. It's the best way to protect ourselves and our communities.\ncambeiu: Agreed.

That's when people compare the efficacy between Sinovac/Coronavac to the Western Moderna/Pfizer vaccine, and get the conclusion that those Chinses vaccines are garbage. \nActually, as WHO has pointed out at the beginning, any vaccine has more than 50% efficacy and safe to use are good vaccine. There is no good/bad between them. All we need at this point is to stop the arguments and save people's life. \nAlso, those Chinese vaccines are using the traditional ways how we make all other vaccines for the past one hundred years. It has already been proved to be a save way before, but it is difficult to make. Western developed countries have already gave up that technology and sent the manufacture plants to developing countries like China and India, so even they want to pick up this route, they can't. However, with the development of the technology, scientists have found a new way using the mRNA as a tool to fight with the viruses, so Moderna/Pfizer decides to give it a try for the first time on human during this pandemic, even though this method has only been tested on animals before. Thank god it turns out to be a great success, and many people's lives were saved in the US/EU and other Western counties. But there are still some technical issues with it, for example, these vaccines needs to be stored at a cold environment, which will make it very hard to distribute around the developing/underdevelopment countries.\nHope all of my South America friends will get the vaccine they need and get the life back to normal ASAP.\nbwc6: &gt;so Moderna/Pfizer decides to give it a try for the first time on human during this pandemic\nYour post is very well written and accurate, but I want to point out that this one statement isn't really true. \n[There had been many mRNA human trials back in 2018.

The thermo-mechanical history of the samples during the mixing process was monitored and adjusted to identical final temperatures. The filler structure on large scales up to micrometers was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and very small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). A complete quantitative model extending from the primary silica nanoparticle (of radius \\approx 10 nm), to nanoparticles aggregates, up to micrometer-sized branches with typical lateral dimension of 150 nm is proposed. Image analysis of the TEM-pictures yields the fraction of zones of pure polymer, which extend between\n\nText continuation:\n10% to 30% of the total sample area. These zones are characterized by a uniform polymer matrix with a high degree of crystallinity, which is attributed to the presence of the silica nanoparticles. The remaining 70% to 90% of the sample area is composed of a complex network of polymer-silica interfaces, where the polymer chains are strongly adsorbed onto the silica surface, forming a rigid and highly ordered structure. This complex network is responsible for the remarkable mechanical and thermal properties of the nanocomposites, including their high stiffness, toughness, and thermal conductivity.\nFurthermore, the SAXS data reveal the presence of a hierarchical structure, where the primary silica nanoparticles are aggregated into larger clusters, which in turn are connected to form a three-dimensional network. This network is characterized by a high degree of porosity, which allows for the diffusion of molecules and ions through the material. The porosity is also responsible for the high surface area of the nanocomposites, which is essential for their applications in catalysis, sensing, and energy storage.\nThe proposed model provides a detailed understanding of the filler structure and its relationship with the mechanical and thermal properties of the nanocomposites. It can be used to design and optimize the properties of these materials for specific applications, such as the development of high-performance composites for aerospace and automotive industries, or the creation of novel sensors and catalysts for energy and environmental applications.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"r\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation mentions the country \"Austria\".\n\nText start:\nSimplified silica (Zeosil 1165 MP) and SBR (140k carrying silanol end-groups) nanocomposites have been formulated by mixing of a reduced number of ingredients with respect to industrial applications. The thermo-mechanical history of the samples during the mixing process was monitored and adjusted to identical final temperatures. The filler structure on large scales up to micrometers was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and very small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). A complete quantitative model extending from the primary silica nanoparticle (of radius \\approx 10 nm), to nanoparticles aggregates, up to micrometer-sized branches with typical lateral dimension of 150 nm is proposed. Image analysis of the TEM-pictures yields the fraction of zones of pure polymer, which extend between\n\nText continuation:\nthe branches of a large-scale filler network. This network is compatible with a fractal of average dimension 2.4 as measured by scattering. On smaller length scales, inside the branches, small silica aggregates are present. Their average radius has been deduced from a Kratky analysis, and it ranges between 35 and 40 nm for all silica fractions investigated here (\\phi_si = 8-21% vol.). A central piece of our analysis is the description of the interaggregate interaction by a simulated structure factor for polydisperse spheres representing aggregates. A polydispersity of 30% in aggregate size is assumed, and interactions between these aggregates are described with a hard core repulsive potential. The same distribution in size is used to evaluate the polydisperse form factor. Comparison with the experimental intensity leads to the determination of the average aggregate compacity (assumed identical for all aggregates in the distribution, between 31% and 38% depending on \\phi_si), and thus aggregation number (ca. 45, with a large spread). Because of the effect of aggregate compacity and of pure polymer zones, the volume fraction of aggregates is higher in the branches than \\phi_si. The repulsion between aggregates has a strong effect on the apparent isothermal compressibility: it leads to a characteristic low-q depression, which cannot be interpreted as aggregate mass decrease in our data. In addition, the reinforcement effect of these silica structures in the SBR-matrix is characterized with oscillatory shear and described with a model based on the same aggregate compacity. Finally, our results show that it is possible to analyze the complex structure of interacting aggregates in nanocomposites of industrial origin in a self-consistent and quantitative manner.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Austria\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Lewis Hamilton will be able to afford a lot more champagne in the future. The Briton is set to become one of the most marketable sport stars in the world -- perhaps second only to Tiger Woods -- and earn more than a billion dollars if he can maintain the buzz created by his first season in Formula One, experts say. On Sunday he started his second season in perfect fashion, easily winning the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. The 23-year-old signed a five-year contract with McLaren worth an estimated $140m in January. It leaves him lagging along way behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who is paid an estimated $50m a year for driving, but it is through endorsements that he stands to reap a greater windfall. Stephen Cheliotis, chief executive of the Centre for Brand Analysis and UK Superbrands and CoolBrands Councils' chairman, said Hamilton was the most marketable driver because he was a breath of fresh air. He had helped drive up race attendance and television fewer figures dramatically in his first season. \"He is young, mixing with the right people everyday -- rappers, film stars -- and a lot more articulate than Kimi Raikkonen,\" Cheliotis said. \"He is also the first black driver and it does have a bearing, much like Tiger Woods in golf. He is also the most marketable because he is going to be the best, much like Michael Schumacher.\" Pippa Collett, Sponsorship Consulting's managing director, said Hamilton was certainly the most marketable driver in the short term. His performance meant he was the dominant member of a group of \"young turks\" -- Nelson Piquet Jr, Nico Rosberg, Heikki Kovalainen -- who had great potential. Collett said in terms of the media Hamilton's performance, friendliness, English speaking background and professionalism were key assets. If he could maintain these he would earn more than Schumacher -- the sport's first billionaire driver. Indeed, Schumacher set an example which Hamilton would be wise to follow. He was the first driver to win personal sponsors after Ferrari allowed him to sign a $10m annual deal with a German bank to place its logo on his cap. The German also actively pursued the development of his own retail range, which included caps -- he sold hundreds of thousands at $30 a pop -- and even a branded vacuum cleaner. Collett said Schumacher's manager, Willi Weber, was very good. \"Schumacher was a nice guy but not very charming. However, he was very professional and you knew he would turn up,\" Collett said. Cheliotis agreed Hamilton would earn considerably more than Schumacher, and that there would be a big gap between his earnings and that of the other drivers. However, there were pitfalls. Lewis had already made the mistake of saying he was moving to Switzerland to avoid the limelight when it was all about avoiding tax, Cheliotis said. \"He said that and then turned up at every awards night for a month.\" Cheliotis said appearing arrogant, being caught out by the tabloid press, endorsing a brand and then using another and over selling himself could also damage his value. \"The big danger with someone like Hamilton is that he is so in demand and that he has so many sponsors it leads to brand confusion. There is a danger of being one of 50 sponsors and not getting any value.\" Collett said Hamilton needed to develop his \"life-time brand\". While Raikkonen may not be a media darling he had developed an \"Iceman\" image, which was just as important in the long term. English footballer David Beckham, whose performance had dropped off, had successfully developed a life-time brand that would out last his playing career. Collett said Hamilton's one weakness may be his father, Anthony. \"His dad is his manager. Your brand positioning is as an individual... having your dad around too much could affect your brand.\" Collett said Hamilton would have to be wary of bad press, but a little bit of young turk behaviour could enhance his image as long as he continued to excel. \"I think that is part of the glamour... some of that and continued brilliant performances will make his life very easy.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nSummary:\nLewis Hamilton signs 5-year contract with McLaren worth $140m.\nHe's expected to become one of the most marketable sports stars, earning over $1 billion.\nHamilton's articulate, young, and charismatic, making him a breath of fresh air in Formula One.\nHe's poised to surpass Michael Schumacher's earnings, becoming the sport's highest-paid driver.\n\nDoes the summary contain the letter \"l\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Hamilton", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The pope arrives to address U.S. bishops in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He spoke at a prayer service with U.S. bishops at Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Roman Catholic church in North America. Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a \"deep shame\" and called it \"gravely immoral behavior.\" \"Many of you have spoken to me of the enormous pain that your communities have suffered when clerics have betrayed ... their obligations,\" he told the bishops. Responding to the situation has not been easy and was sometimes very badly handled, the pope admitted.  Watch the pope address the issue \u00bb . \"It is vitally important that the vulnerable are always shielded from souls who would cause harm,\" he said. The pope then turned his attention to a different concern involving kids. \"What does it mean to speak of child protection when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many homes through media widely available today?\" he asked. Benedict urged the media and entertainment industry to take part in a \"moral renewal.\" Earlier Wednesday, President Bush, first lady Laura Bush and more than 13,500 spectators welcomed Benedict in an elaborate ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. In remarks greeting the pope to the White House, Bush called the United States \"a nation of prayer.\" Bush was interrupted by applause as he said, \"In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded, we need your message that all human life is sacred and that each of us is willed.\" Benedict responded by praising the role of religion in the United States. \"From the dawn of the republic, America's quest for freedom has been guided by the conviction that the principles governing political and social life are intimately linked to a moral order based on the dominion of God the creator,\" he said.  Watch Benedict talk about his hopes for the trip \u00bb . Earlier, a U.S. Marine Corps band performed the national anthem of the Holy See as well as \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" A fife and drum corps in Colonial costumes also played tunes, including \"Yankee Doodle,\" and soprano Kathleen Battle sang \"The Lord's Prayer.\" The day, with perfect spring weather, was also the pontiff's 81st birthday.  After the ceremony concluded, the crowd, led by Battle, serenaded Benedict with \"Happy Birthday\" as he smiled from a White House balcony.  Watch a priest who has known Benedict for years tell what he's like \u00bb . Guests on the South Lawn included Catholic clergy, ecumenical representatives, Catholic schoolchildren, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Sisters of the Poor and Knights of Columbus. Event planners faced an enormous demand for tickets for what White House press secretary Dana Perino called \"one of the largest arrival ceremonies ever held at the White House.\" Following the ceremony, Bush and the pope had a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office. The pope left the White House at about noon in his distinctive \"popemobile.\" His massive motorcade moved slowly down the wide avenues of the U.S. capital to the Vatican Embassy, where the pope is staying. Crowds of enthusiastic spectators waved U.S. and Vatican flags and screamed as the pontiff rode past. A smiling Benedict arrived Tuesday at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to cheers from a crowd of invited guests. The pontiff was greeted by Bush, the first lady and their daughter Jenna, each of whom shook his hand. It was believed to be the first time an American president has greeted a world dignitary on arrival at Andrews. It marks Benedict's first visit to the United States as pope.   Watch how the pope's visit could affect the presidential campaign \u00bb . Security will be tight during the six-day visit, with 27 state, local and federal agencies protecting the pope as he meets with religious leaders, celebrates Mass at two baseball stadiums and makes his way around in the popemobile. Benedict faces no specific threats, according to the FBI, but a March audio message from Osama bin Laden mentioned the pontiff. The centerpiece of the trip's Washington leg will be Thursday's Mass at Nationals Park, a new baseball stadium where 46,000 people will gather to see the pope. Everyone must go through metal detectors on entering, and nearby roads and bridges will be closed. Temporary flight restrictions will be in place over the stadium, and a 1\u00bd-mile section of the adjacent Anacostia River will be closed during the Mass. Benedict will travel to New York on Friday and address the U.N. General Assembly, linking the visit to the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He'll celebrate Mass on Sunday morning at Yankee Stadium.  Where will the pope be? \u00bb . One of the stated goals of the pope's visit is to energize the U.S. Catholic community with its estimated 70 million members. Three years after succeeding Pope John Paul II, Benedict is likely to also address the church's relationship with other faiths, the U.S.-led war in Iraq and the upcoming U.S. presidential election, said John Allen, a CNN Vatican analyst.

The revolution was sparked by a series of taxes imposed by the British government on the colonies, which led to widespread protests and boycotts. The colonies formed a Continental Army, led by George Washington, and fought a series of battles against the British Army, including the Battle of Saratoga and the Battle of Yorktown. In 1781, the Continental Army, assisted by French forces, defeated the British at Yorktown, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which recognized American independence. The American Revolution was a pivotal event in world history, influencing the development of modern democracy and self-governance.\n\nDoes the summary contain the letter \"i\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The colonists of Great Britain were tired of being taxed endlessly by King George lll. The revolution started when some of Britain's forces assaulted revolutionary colonists at Lexington. This convinced many people to fight for the colonists. Finally, after many long battles and suffering, at the battle of Yorktown in 1781, Great Britain's forces surrendered to General Roshambo and General Washington. King George lll passed the Treaty of Paris in 1783. The colonists, now free from Britain, started America.

This exception should be used only in cases where the urgency of the situation outweighs the need for a thorough conformity assessment, and the AI system is designed and used in a way that minimizes the risk to health, safety, and the environment.\nIn addition, the regulation should establish clear guidelines and procedures for the notification and reporting of AI systems that are put into service without prior authorisation. This would ensure that the authorities are informed and can take necessary measures to monitor the AI system's performance and ensure that it does not pose a risk to public health and safety. Furthermore, the regulation should also provide for a review process to assess the effectiveness of the AI system and identify any potential risks or issues that may arise during its operation.\nThe regulation should also take into account the need for transparency and accountability in the development, deployment, and use of AI systems. This could be achieved by establishing a system of transparency and accountability, where the developers and users of AI systems are required to provide information on the system's capabilities, limitations, and potential risks. This would enable stakeholders to make informed decisions about the use of AI systems and ensure that they are used in a responsible and ethical manner.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"u\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

For others, it's just plain hell. Take Felicia Sullivan, of Brooklyn. Four years ago, she and her live-in boyfriend -- the guy she thought she would marry -- were having a pre-Valentine's Day brunch when Sullivan leaned over and whispered a few sweet nothings in his ear. \"I said, 'I'm so happy to know that you're the one for me. Aren't you glad to know I'm the one for you?' \" says Sullivan, 32, who works in marketing. \"And there was this silence. And then he was, like, 'I know you're the one for me now. But can you give me until summer to make a final decision?' \" Aghast at his response, Sullivan quickly broke things off -- but she couldn't move until she found a new apartment. Home alone on February 14 in the apartment they shared, she decided to snoop through her ex-boyfriend's e-mail and discovered he'd had contact with several other women while they were together. \"I've never been a big fan of the holiday,\" Sullivan says. \"But now I typically refer to it as Black Monday...\"   Watch whether romance is still alive \u00bb . Good times, bad times . Sullivan isn't alone in dreading Valentine's Day. Thanks to super-sized expectations and over-the-top commercialization, February 14 has gone from a sentimental aside to a pressure-filled gauntlet lined with chocolate boxes, tennis bracelets and cheesy stuffed bears.  See where the love dollars go \u00bb . \"The holiday's designed to make you feel (bad),\" says Judy McGuire, author of \"How Not to Date.\" \"If you're in a relationship, it's never anything that it's supposed to be. And if you're single, you feel like a big loser because you don't have anybody. I think people should lower Valentine's Day expectations to pretty much nil. That way, anything that happens is good.\" Brian Wise, a 32-year-old technical writer from Seattle has seen his Valentine's Day go sideways repeatedly -- most memorably the time he ended up in handcuffs (and not in a good way). \"Last year, I was in Singapore and I met this beautiful woman who took me to dinner at this hot, new restaurant,'\" he says. \"But then she gets food poisoning and ends up in an alley with major gastrointestinal problems. And while I'm standing guard, the cops pull up and think I'm paying her for sex.\" Wise talked his way out of an arrest (luckily, one of the policemen had eaten at the same place) but he's found no release from his unlucky Valentine's. \"It doesn't matter who I'm out with,\" he says. \"The day is just cursed.\" There are ways, though, to avoid a miserable holiday. Good plans . Most women will admit they like to celebrate, but a fancy night on the town isn't necessary. \"Sometimes, hanging out at home can be a lot more fun than going out to some restaurant filled with couples,\" says author McGuire. \"Stay home with champagne, caviar and maybe a new toy from a tasteful sex shop.\" If you're not dating anyone, take some time to indulge yourself (a luxurious bar of chocolate, a pedicure), do something relaxing (take a yoga class or get a massage) or spend time with some of your closest friends. Make sure you're on the same page . And if you do make plans, stick to them. Galen, a 28-year-old secretary from Seattle, and her boyfriend had made special Valentine's Day plans a month in advance. But on the big night, his buddies showed up and talked him into going out with them instead. \"I was dressed to the nines,\" says Galen, who asked that her last name not be used. \"When his friends stopped by, he says, 'Do you mind if I go with them?' I said, 'Fine, go,' being totally sarcastic, and he picked up his coat and left.\" Although they talked about it later, Galen said, her boyfriend seemed not to understand that she was unhappy with his wanting to ditch her for his buddies. The two later broke up. Breaking a date on Valentine's Day is definitely bad form, but automatically expecting one to happen (a much more common scenario) is also problematic. To avoid a disconnect with your significant other, McGuire suggests being honest. Simply expecting your partner to know what you want is unrealistic. Not-so-good gifts . If you decide to go the gift route, McGuire recommends not settling for a clich\u00e9 like a stuffed animal or a hastily purchased bouquet of flowers. \"Listen to what the person talks about,\" she says. \"She may want the new 'Godzilla' game for her Wii. His underwear may be riddled with holes.\" Another thing to avoid, advises Katie Briggs, 44, of Seattle, is the gag gift. A few years ago, Briggs and a new beau went out to a nice restaurant where they shared dinner, drinks and presents. Briggs gave her date homemade cookies and a Starbucks gift card. He gave her a beautifully-wrapped box -- of Spam. \"He thought it was the best joke ever,\" says Briggs. \"But it just wasn't thoughtful. If you're going to go with a joke, you need to back it up with something else.\" E-mail to a friend . LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.

That way, anything that happens is good.\" Brian Wise, a 32-year-old technical writer from Seattle has seen his Valentine's Day go sideways repeatedly -- most memorably the time he ended up in handcuffs (and not in a good way). \"Last year, I was in Singapore and I met this beautiful woman who took me to dinner at this hot, new restaurant,'\" he says. \"But then she gets food poisoning and ends up in an alley with major gastrointestinal problems. And while I'm standing guard, the cops pull up and think I'm paying her for sex.\" Wise talked his way out of an arrest (luckily, one of the policemen had eaten at the same place) but he's found no release from his unlucky Valentine's. \"It doesn't matter who I'm out with,\" he says. \"The day is just cursed.\" There are ways, though, to avoid a miserable holiday. Good plans . Most women will admit they like to celebrate, but a fancy night on the town isn't necessary. \"Sometimes, hanging out at home can be a lot more fun than going out to some restaurant filled with couples,\" says author McGuire. \"Stay home with champagne, caviar and maybe a new toy from a tasteful sex shop.\" If you're not dating anyone, take some time to indulge yourself (a luxurious bar of chocolate, a pedicure), do something relaxing (take a yoga class or get a massage) or spend time with some of your closest friends. Make sure you're on the same page . And if you do make plans, stick to them. Galen, a 28-year-old secretary from Seattle, and her boyfriend had made special Valentine's Day plans a month in advance. But on the big night, his buddies showed up and talked him into going out with them instead. \"I was dressed to the nines,\" says Galen, who asked that her last name not be used. \"When his friends stopped by, he says, 'Do you mind if I go with them?' I said, 'Fine, go,' being totally sarcastic, and he picked up his coat and left.\" Although they talked about it later, Galen said, her boyfriend seemed not to understand that she was unhappy with his wanting to ditch her for his buddies. The two later broke up. Breaking a date on Valentine's Day is definitely bad form, but automatically expecting one to happen (a much more common scenario) is also problematic. To avoid a disconnect with your significant other, McGuire suggests being honest. Simply expecting your partner to know what you want is unrealistic. Not-so-good gifts . If you decide to go the gift route, McGuire recommends not settling for a clich\u00e9 like a stuffed animal or a hastily purchased bouquet of flowers. \"Listen to what the person talks about,\" she says. \"She may want the new 'Godzilla' game for her Wii. His underwear may be riddled with holes.\" Another thing to avoid, advises Katie Briggs, 44, of Seattle, is the gag gift. A few years ago, Briggs and a new beau went out to a nice restaurant where they shared dinner, drinks and presents. Briggs gave her date homemade cookies and a Starbucks gift card. He gave her a beautifully-wrapped box -- of Spam. \"He thought it was the best joke ever,\" says Briggs. \"But it just wasn't thoughtful. If you're going to go with a joke, you need to back it up with something else.\" E-mail to a friend . LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.

She either has something going on in her life or is just avoiding you. Either way, let her come back to you don't persistently bug her :)\nresay23: I\u2019ve felt like this for awhile but never talked to her about, though we see each other alot so its kind normal to ask her how are things going on, and I have nothing to base that feeling upon its just the vibe when we are left alone I feel awkward and I don't want her to feel awkward or uncomfortable\nMonkey-Honker: Are you Male or Female?\nresay23: Male\nMonkey-Honker: Can be numerous things then, have you recently told her you might have feelings for her? Done anything in person with her that broke\n\nText continuation:\nthe ice or created a sense of intimacy?\nresay23: Yeah, I've told her that I really value our friendship and that I care about her deeply, but I never explicitly said I had romantic feelings for her. We've had some good conversations and shared some laughs, but I don't think we've done anything that would make her feel uncomfortable or awkward around me. We've just kinda hung out and enjoyed each other's company.\nMonkey-Honker: That's good to know. So, it seems like you're trying to gauge her feelings without being too pushy or aggressive. That's a great approach. Now, let's think about this from her perspective. If she's not reciprocating your feelings, it's possible that she doesn't see you in that way or maybe she's not ready to explore romantic feelings. It's also possible that she's not comfortable with the idea of being in a romantic relationship with you. You need to respect her boundaries and give her space if that's the case.\nresay23: Yeah, I'm trying to be understanding and not push her away. I just want to know where she stands and if there's a possibility of something more between us. I don't want to ruin our friendship if she's not interested.\nMonkey-Honker: Exactly! You want to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings, but you also want to make sure you're not putting pressure on her to reciprocate. You need to be prepared for any outcome, whether it's that she feels the same way, or that she doesn't. You need to respect her decision and continue to value your friendship regardless of the outcome.\nresay23: Yeah, I think I can do that. I just want to be honest and authentic in my approach. I don't want to play games or manipulate her into feeling something she doesn't.\nMonkey-Honker: That's the right attitude to have. Now, let's think about how you can bring this up in conversation. You could start by saying something like, \"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about us. I've been feeling a certain way lately, and I wanted to get your take on it. I value our friendship so much, and I just wanted to be honest with you about how I'm feeling.\" This approach shows that you're coming from a place of honesty and vulnerability, and it gives her the opportunity to share her feelings with you.\nresay23: Yeah, that sounds like a good approach. I'll try to be as open and honest as possible, and see where the conversation goes from there.\nMonkey-Honker: Exactly! Remember to listen to her response and be respectful of her feelings, regardless of what she says. And don't forget to give her space if she needs it. You can always follow up with her later and see how she's doing.\nresay23: Yeah, I'll try to do that. Thanks for the advice, I feel a little more confident about approaching the conversation now.\nMonkey-Honker: No problem, happy to help! Just remember to be true to yourself and be respectful of her feelings.

Never broke any friend barrier and she doesn\u2019t have a current boyfriend. And Like for the past year-year and half I became extra careful with her to not give her the vibe that Im pushing myself towards her, I stopped texting her expect for valid reasons I try not to leave us alone at any time and so kn\nMonkey-Honker: It seems like it all went a bit wrong a few years ago when you dipped into moving past friends, which didn't go as planned. I believe you could still have feelings for her but also don't want to lose her as a friend so you kinda tip toed around her for a while and whilst not letting on your feelings for her were still there. If she hasn't messaged you, it could be she's just moved on and you need to as well for your peace of mind.\n Not trying to upset you but this seems the case. If you messaged her last let her message you next if she does brilliant there's still a friendship there. I would speak to her in person and say I know we dated a while ago and it didn't work out but I still want us to be friends and back to how we were. Tell her how your feeling about how you feel you two have drifted apart. If she acknowledges it, then there's a friendship still there, but if she dodges the conversation, it's time to move on for yours and her sake :)\nI can tell from what you're saying you have very strong feelings for this girl but honestly, you need to find someone who you can express this emotion to. It will be hard at first but feelings come and go and so do people. Get out, meet new people and before you know it you'll be with someone who shows you love and affection and not what you're putting yourself through at the moment, which is wasted emotion.\nresay23: yeah it sis go wrong but we didn\u2019t just say lets be friends and moved on, we stopped talking for a while and then slowly we began being friends\nBut the harder thing is that we have the same group of friends and we are tight together  so if I ever wanted to cut her off or something Im cutting of a whole group friends that are close to me\nI did have strong feelings for her and I couldn\u2019t move on but I think I did or I just numbed my feelings and avoid it\nAlso I can\u2019t get go and see other girls because I don't know how to initiate things, nervous and an introvert in general not just with girls so I just feel stuck in my life\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Kuwait\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Good", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Will you have that many classes for me right away?\nUser 1: No, probably not. For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours.\nUser 2: But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month. Will you pay me that much for the first month? Because, I mean, I won't be working so many hours.\nUser 1: I understand. That's why I didn't write the date on the contract. For the first two weeks, we will pay you according to the hours you teach. When you have 22 hours of classes, then the contract will take effect. Is that alright with you?\nUser 2: Oh, so I don't sign the contract today. Is that right?\nUser\n\nText continuation:\n1: That's correct. We'll hold off on signing the contract until you've completed the first two weeks and we've confirmed that you're meeting the requirements.\nUser 2: Okay, that makes sense. But can I ask, what's the typical workload like after the first two weeks? Will I be teaching more classes or will it remain the same?\nUser 1: It's usually a gradual increase in workload, but it depends on the school's needs and the students' schedules. We'll reassess your workload after the first two weeks and adjust accordingly. You'll also have the opportunity to provide feedback and make any necessary adjustments to your schedule.\nUser 2: Alright, that sounds reasonable. What kind of support can I expect from the school in terms of resources and materials?\nUser 1: We provide all the necessary materials and resources for your classes, including textbooks, handouts, and technology. You'll also have access to our staff development program, which offers training and workshops on teaching techniques and curriculum development.\nUser 2: That's great to hear. What about office hours? Will I have dedicated time to meet with students or will I need to make arrangements with the school?\nUser 1: You'll have dedicated office hours, which will be scheduled with the school's administration. You'll also have access to our student services department, which can assist with any student-related issues or concerns.\nUser 2: Okay, I think that covers everything. Can I get a copy of the contract to review again before we finalize the details?\nUser 1: Absolutely.

The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge. But we don't offer vouchers to employees.\nUser 2: But according to the contract, employees get a discount in the restaurant.\nUser 1: That's right.

Ex: /u/&lt;username&gt;.\n/u/vaughannt asked: \n&gt;I'm trying to work up to the arch hold. Currently just doing the leg lift portion for 30 seconds. Should I be feeling muscle activation in my core? It seems like I only feel it in my legs. I was feeling it in my lower back momentarily but I think I've corrected that. Anyone have tips?\nstickysweetastytreat: u/vaughannt\nYeah feeling it in your legs is fine, like along your butt &amp; backs of your thighs. For low back, there are two ways you can do it-- by moving your low back with it, or not. If you want to keep it out of your low back, then tuck your tailbone while you lift your legs solely with your butt + legs. Don't expect to lift your legs very high this way, but you do put more work on your butt/legs. Instead of thinking \"tuck your tailbone\", you could also think of it like trying to draw your navel up away from the floor while you lift your legs.\nIf your low back isn't irritated by it, there's no inherent harm in moving with your low back. You could even try both ways!\nvaughannt: Awesome, thank you for the reply!\nstickysweetastytreat: Yw, good luck!\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Uruguay\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "assistant", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

He served as a sheriff from 1991 until 2013, and said the variations reflected the independence of the judiciary.\nHe said: \"Obviously there is now, as I understand it, a board set up for advising on sentence to the judiciary.\n\"But every judge is his own person or her own person, and they all have different ways of dealing with things, they all have different views and they are all independent.\n\"There has to be a certain degree of uniformity and that is undoubtedly enforced by the existence of an Appeal Court so anyone who does something which is particularly outrageous, as far as what is perceived to be the appropriate way of dealing with people, that can be corrected.\n\"But variety is the spice of life and I think that it would be wrong to try to dragoon the judiciary into dealing with things which they believe to be the correct way of dealing with things.\n\"They have local knowledge, they know the person, they have full information and they deal with it to the best of their ability and you have to trust that person to deal with it in that particular way.\"\n\nSummary:\nStatistics released under Freedom of Information legislation have shown significant variations in the proportion of jail sentences handed down in sheriff courts across Scotland.\n\nDoes the summary mention the country \"Malta\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Good", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Where did xiaolongbao originate from and what are some key types\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary contains the letter \"i\".\n\nArticle:\n\"Xiaolongbao\" originated in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, by Wan Hua Tea House in the years of Daoguang Emperor (1820 to 1850). Xiaolongbao evolved from the guantangbao (soup-filled dumplings/buns) from Kaifeng, Henan province, the capital city of Northern Song Dynasty (AD 960\u20131127).\nThere are numerous styles of xiaolongbao in Jiangsu cuisine. Shanghai-style xiaolongbao originated in Nanxiang, which was a neighboring village of Shanghai in Jiangsu that eventually ended up becoming an outer suburb of Shanghai's Jiading District.

Xiaolongbao evolved from the guantangbao (soup-filled dumplings/buns) from Kaifeng, Henan province, the capital city of Northern Song Dynasty (AD 960\u20131127).\nThere are numerous styles of xiaolongbao in Jiangsu cuisine. Shanghai-style xiaolongbao originated in Nanxiang, which was a neighboring village of Shanghai in Jiangsu that eventually ended up becoming an outer suburb of Shanghai's Jiading District. The inventor of xiaolongbao sold them in his first store in Nanxiang next to the town's notable park, Guyi Garden. From there the xiaolongbao expanded into downtown Shanghai and outward. The Suzhou and Wuxi styles are larger (sometimes twice as large as a Nanxiang-style soup dumpling) and have sweeter fillings. The Nanjing style is smaller with an almost translucent skin and less meat.\n\nSummary:\nXiaolongbao were first seen in Chengzhou which is located in Jiangsu province.\nSince it's humble beginnings it has spread far and wide and there exist many variants.\nA few common types are the:\n- Shanghai Style\n- Suzhou Style\n- Wuxi Style\n- Nanjing Style\n\nDoes the summary mention the country \"Ireland\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

But she wasn't looking for the perfect safari lodge. She was hunting for the right cosmetic surgeon. When she told her family, it wasn't an easy sell. \"South Africa? You're going to get some kind of witch doctor,\" she recalls her father saying. \"But I told him they perfected some of the first heart surgeries down there. To me, South Africa had the most reputable surgeons.\" Hiltbrunner, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, traveled to Johannesburg in 2004 for a face-lift, upper arm lift and eyelid surgery. And she and her husband -- who hadn't taken a vacation in 20 years -- went on a luxury safari, included in the package by medical-travel agency Surgeon and Safari. \"Medical tourism\" may sound strange, but patients are discovering they can get some cosmetic surgeries abroad for less than the U.S. price. And many surgeries include sightseeing packages. The roster of countries in which hospitals and surgeons are marketing their services to foreigners is growing. South Africa, Argentina, Thailand, Brazil, Costa Rica, India and Singapore have become major players. Robert Painter, a travel writer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, journeyed last year to Argentina for dental surgeries -- and tango lessons: \"If I'm going to be stuck somewhere for two weeks at a time, twice, Buenos Aires has got to be the best possible place,\" he says . Painter's procedures were organized by Plenitas, a medical-travel facilitator in Buenos Aires, which booked him at a hotel with a dance studio in the back. He wasn't the only guest getting surgery: \"While I was there, there was a young lady who was also having implants -- though not of the dental type.\" Cost-cutting pros and cons . Cosmetic, or elective, procedures aren't covered by insurance, so cost remains the motivating factor for most medical tourists. Surgeries in many countries cost half or even one-fifth what they would in the U.S. -- including airfare, hotel and excursions. \"A full face-lift that would cost $20,000 in the U.S. runs about $1,250 in South Africa,\" a 2005 article in U-Daily, the University of Delaware's online news service noted. Faith Richter, of Hope Sound, Florida, got a face-lift in Bangkok, Thailand. Her trip was organized by New York City's Med Journeys. \"In the U.S., it would have cost $20,000 for the procedure alone, with no time in the hospital,\" she says. In Bangkok, Richter was in the hospital four days, and the total cost of her 19-day trip, including sightseeing and airfare for two, was $10,600. Painter estimates he saved $18,000 on his surgeries. \"Cost was the primary factor,\" he says. \"The only factor.\" Medical costs abroad are less than in the U.S. for many reasons -- favorable exchange rates, lower salaries and fewer medical lawsuits, which means lower malpractice-insurance costs. But the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery warns against low-cost surgery. \"Get bargains on your shoes and laundry detergent, not on your face,\" says spokesman Tony Staffieri. \"Researching the quality of doctors should be a patient's primary consideration, but it isn't always,\" he says. \"Some people think 'tummy tuck and shopping.' This is not makeup; it's somebody cutting you.\" Some medical professionals fear that patients will overlook the severity of invasive surgeries and fail to ask the right questions. More casual attitudes toward plastic surgery -- spurred by lunch-break Botox treatments and same-day liposuctions, paired with temptingly cheap alternatives and vacation packages -- increase the risk of bad outcomes. Even stateside, cosmetic surgery can have tragic results. \"First Wives Club\" author Olivia Goldsmith died during a chin-tuck in 2004, and this year Kanye West's mother, Donda, died after a tummy tuck and breast reduction. However, a 2004 study published in the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, found that \"deaths occurring at office-based surgery facilities (in the U.S.) are rare -- less than a quarter of a percent.\" Quality surgeons . Medical tourism experts counter criticism by saying that cheaper prices don't necessarily mean lower quality of care. \"In general, it is the hospitals and facilities that have justifiable claim to 'world-class' status or to meeting or exceeding U.S. standards that are competing for patients from the United States and other countries,\" says Jeff Schult, author of \"Beauty from Afar: A Medical Tourist's Guide to Affordable and Quality Cosmetic Care Outside the U.S.\" The authors of a 2006 \"New England Journal of Medicine\" article confirm the high standards of internationally accredited hospitals: \"We doubt (...) that the average U.S. hospital can offer better outcomes for common complex operations.\" \"Almost 80 percent of the doctors we use have been trained in the U.S. or U.K.,\" says Tim Wallace, vice president of sales and marketing for Med Journeys. \"It gives the American consumer a degree of confidence.\" Richter, a registered nurse, agrees that standards are high abroad. \"After the surgery, the nurses were there for me 100 percent,\" she says. \"At home, we're so understaffed and overburdened, and inundated with paperwork.\" When Painter visited U.S. dentists, \"I felt like I was being processed for a home loan,\" he says. \"In Argentina, I had three dentists working on me at once.\" While medical tourism continues to increase in popularity, it's still not mainstream. When Richter left for Bangkok, she \"didn't tell a soul, not even my seven children, who are almost all in the medical field. They would have had a stroke. \"At Thanksgiving, though, they were all saying, 'You really do look good.'\" E-mail to a friend . LifeWire provides original and syndicated content to web publishers.

He wasn't the only guest getting surgery: \"While I was there, there was a young lady who was also having implants -- though not of the dental type.\" Cost-cutting pros and cons . Cosmetic, or elective, procedures aren't covered by insurance, so cost remains the motivating factor for most medical tourists. Surgeries in many countries cost half or even one-fifth what they would in the U.S. -- including airfare, hotel and excursions. \"A full face-lift that would cost $20,000 in the U.S. runs about $1,250 in South Africa,\" a 2005 article in U-Daily, the University of Delaware's online news service noted. Faith Richter, of Hope Sound, Florida, got a face-lift in Bangkok, Thailand. Her trip was organized by New York City's Med Journeys. \"In the U.S., it would have cost $20,000 for the procedure alone, with no time in the hospital,\" she says. In Bangkok, Richter was in the hospital four days, and the total cost of her 19-day trip, including sightseeing and airfare for two, was $10,600. Painter estimates he saved $18,000 on his surgeries. \"Cost was the primary factor,\" he says. \"The only factor.\" Medical costs abroad are less than in the U.S. for many reasons -- favorable exchange rates, lower salaries and fewer medical lawsuits, which means lower malpractice-insurance costs. But the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery warns against low-cost surgery. \"Get bargains on your shoes and laundry detergent, not on your face,\" says spokesman Tony Staffieri. \"Researching the quality of doctors should be a patient's primary consideration, but it isn't always,\" he says. \"Some people think 'tummy tuck and shopping.' This is not makeup; it's somebody cutting you.\" Some medical professionals fear that patients will overlook the severity of invasive surgeries and fail to ask the right questions. More casual attitudes toward plastic surgery -- spurred by lunch-break Botox treatments and same-day liposuctions, paired with temptingly cheap alternatives and vacation packages -- increase the risk of bad outcomes. Even stateside, cosmetic surgery can have tragic results. \"First Wives Club\" author Olivia Goldsmith died during a chin-tuck in 2004, and this year Kanye West's mother, Donda, died after a tummy tuck and breast reduction. However, a 2004 study published in the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, found that \"deaths occurring at office-based surgery facilities (in the U.S.) are rare -- less than a quarter of a percent.\" Quality surgeons . Medical tourism experts counter criticism by saying that cheaper prices don't necessarily mean lower quality of care. \"In general, it is the hospitals and facilities that have justifiable claim to 'world-class' status or to meeting or exceeding U.S. standards that are competing for patients from the United States and other countries,\" says Jeff Schult, author of \"Beauty from Afar: A Medical Tourist's Guide to Affordable and Quality Cosmetic Care Outside the U.S.\" The authors of a 2006 \"New England Journal of Medicine\" article confirm the high standards of internationally accredited hospitals: \"We doubt (...) that the average U.S. hospital can offer better outcomes for common complex operations.\" \"Almost 80 percent of the doctors we use have been trained in the U.S. or U.K.,\" says Tim Wallace, vice president of sales and marketing for Med Journeys. \"It gives the American consumer a degree of confidence.\" Richter, a registered nurse, agrees that standards are high abroad. \"After the surgery, the nurses were there for me 100 percent,\" she says. \"At home, we're so understaffed and overburdened, and inundated with paperwork.\" When Painter visited U.S. dentists, \"I felt like I was being processed for a home loan,\" he says. \"In Argentina, I had three dentists working on me at once.\" While medical tourism continues to increase in popularity, it's still not mainstream. When Richter left for Bangkok, she \"didn't tell a soul, not even my seven children, who are almost all in the medical field. They would have had a stroke. \"At Thanksgiving, though, they were all saying, 'You really do look good.'\" E-mail to a friend . LifeWire provides original and syndicated content to web publishers.

Can't we have a world where we work together to address global issues without resorting to violence and aggression?\nYEETAWAYLOL: I think the problem is that people have different values and beliefs, and we can't just assume that everyone will agree on the same solution.\nwhitelightstorm: But that's exactly what we do in our foreign policy. We impose our values and beliefs on other countries, often through military force. And then we wonder why they don't like us.\nResponsible-Salad-82: I think it's more complicated than that. We're not just imposing our values, we're also trying to protect our own interests. And sometimes that means making tough decisions that not everyone agrees with.\nYEETAWAYLOL: But at what cost? We're not just talking about the lives lost in conflict, but also the damage to our reputation and the erosion of trust between nations.\nwhitelightstorm: And what about the moral implications? Are we really saying that it's okay to kill people in other countries as long as it's for a \"good\" reason?\nResponsible-Salad-82: I think we need to have a more nuanced conversation about this. We can't just say that all military intervention is bad, but we also can't ignore the complexities of the situation.\nYEETAWAYLOL: I agree. We need to consider the context, the motivations, and the potential consequences of our actions. But we also need to acknowledge the human cost of war and the impact it has on individuals and communities.\nwhitelightstorm: And what about the IVAS? Is that just another tool for us to use to further our own interests, or is it a step towards a more peaceful and cooperative world?\nResponsible-Salad-82: I think it's a bit of both. The technology itself is neutral, but how we choose to use it is what matters. If we use it to further our own interests without considering the impact on others, then it's just another tool for mass destruction. But if we use it to promote peace and cooperation, then it could be a game-changer.\nYEETAWAYLOL: That's a great point. Technology can be a double-edged sword. It can be used for good or evil, depending on our intentions and actions.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"i\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Res", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

No armies, no military, no government and no politicians. It'll all be ending that way, anyway. Total collapse of all systems. When that happens we'll be needing to reinvent ourselves as spiritual beings living on this planet where killing anything would go against the fabric of our souls.\nYEETAWAYLOL: If society collapses we are not going to be non-violent. Violence is part of human nature, and without society it will be much more prolific.\nwhitelightstorm: Violence becomes a part of human nature. Nobody is born that way.\nYEETAWAYLOL: It is. If nobody was violent except one person, that one person would have an advantage, as they can take resources like land, mates, and food by force. Everyone who wasn\u2019t violent would have an evolutionary disadvantage.\nwhitelightstorm: What if that one person who wasn't violent loved the other person and saw the good in them, causing that so-called violent person to change and also to become non-violent? Then they could share resources.

Further back, I hail from the indigenous folk, you know - the ones being attacked from all sorts of psychopathic entities from the \\*church\\*.\nYEETAWAYLOL: So two things: first, your ancestors are literally entertainers for what you call \u201cmass murderers\u201d\nAnd secondly, how do you know anything about combat then? If nobody in your family line us recently fought, you have no idea as to the type of person who fights, or how they think when fighting.\nwhitelightstorm: Ha. No. My ancestors were literally not \\*entertainers\\* - you asked what they did in WW2, this was not their lives, but what they did in service. They hailed from pogroms and the holocaust.  \n   \nAs for me, I landed pretty far from the family tree- the odd one out - and  know a lot about combat, weapons, Krav Maga and am a sharpshooter.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"o\".\n\nText start:\nTwo detection systems based on optical readout were developed: a. Integrative optical detector A 2nd generation of Time-Resolved Integrative Optical Neutron (TRION) detector was developed. It is based on an integrative optical technique, which permits fast-neutron energy-resolved imaging via time-gated optical readout. This mode of operation allows loss-free operation at very high neutron-flux intensities. The TRION neutron imaging system can be regarded as a stroboscopic photography of neutrons arriving at the detector on a few-ns time scale. As this spectroscopic capability is based on the Time-of-Flight (TOF) technique, it has to be operated in conjunction with a pulsed neutron source, such as an ion accelerator producing 1-2 ns wide beam pulses at MHz repetition rates. TRION is capable of\n\nText continuation:\nproviding high-resolution images of neutron-absorbing materials, which is crucial for various applications in fields like nuclear engineering, materials science, and biological research. The system's ability to operate at high flux intensities makes it an attractive tool for studying dynamic processes, such as chemical reactions and phase transitions, which are often accompanied by significant changes in neutron scattering patterns.\nBy combining TRION with advanced data analysis techniques, researchers can gain insights into the underlying physics of complex systems and materials. For instance, the system can be used to study the behavior of nuclear reactors, where the detection of neutron fluxes and energy spectra is crucial for safety and performance monitoring. Additionally, TRION can be employed to investigate the properties of novel materials, such as superconductors and nanomaterials, which exhibit unique neutron scattering patterns that can be exploited for advanced applications. The development of TRION and other optical neutron detectors has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of complex systems and materials, enabling breakthroughs in fields like energy, medicine, and materials science.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"o\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Integrative optical detector A 2nd generation of Time-Resolved Integrative Optical Neutron (TRION) detector was developed. It is based on an integrative optical technique, which permits fast-neutron energy-resolved imaging via time-gated optical readout. This mode of operation allows loss-free operation at very high neutron-flux intensities. The TRION neutron imaging system can be regarded as a stroboscopic photography of neutrons arriving at the detector on a few-ns time scale. As this spectroscopic capability is based on the Time-of-Flight (TOF) technique, it has to be operated in conjunction with a pulsed neutron source, such as an ion accelerator producing 1-2 ns wide beam pulses at MHz repetition rates. TRION is capable of\n\nText continuation:\ncapturing 4 simultaneous TOF frames within a single accelerator pulse and accumulating them over all pulses contained within a finite acquisition time. The detector principle of operation, simulations and experimental results are described. b. Fibrous optical detector A fast neutron imaging detector based on micrometric glass capillaries loaded with high- refractive-index liquid scintillator has been developed. Neutron energy spectrometry is based on event-by-event detection and reconstruction of neutron energy from the measurement of the recoil proton track projection length and the amount of light produced in the track. In addition, the detector can provide fast-neutron imaging with position resolution of tens of microns. The detector principle of operation, simulations and experimental results obtained with a small detector prototype are described. Track-imaging of individual recoil protons from incident neutrons in the range of 2-14 MeV are demonstrated as well as preliminary results of detector spectroscopic capabilities.

O'Neal insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money; discussing the signing he referred to a couple of his product endorsements, saying: \"I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.\" The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996\u201397 season. O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games. In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: \"It's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough.\"\nThe following season, O'Neal averaged 28.3 points and 11.4 rebounds. He led the league with a 58.4 field goal percentage, the first of five consecutive seasons in which he did so. The Lakers finished the season 61\u201321, first in the Pacific Division, and were the second seed in the western conference during the 1998 NBA Playoffs. After defeating the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle SuperSonics in the first two rounds, the Lakers again fell to the Jazz, this time in a 4\u20130 sweep.\n\nSummary:\nAccording to the article, Shaq had at least one season with over 30 ppg, which was the 1996-1997 season where he averaged 26.2 points per game.\n\nDoes the summary contain the letter \"c\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"f\".\n\nText start:\nThis paper shortly summarises the experimental results obtained since 2011 by a large European academic consortium for the scientific conceptualisation, the definition of the technical requirements, the generation of experimental data, and the validation of a numerical code, for the Pulsating Heat Pipes (PHP) experiment on the International Space Station (ISS). The PHP is a passive, wickless thermal device, whereby a two-phase fluid, forming liquid plugs and vapour slugs, moves with a pulsating or circulating motion inside a meandering tube or channel. The PHP may have a very broad range of geometries (flat, tubular, 3D structured), it can dissipate heat from large areas, and it can be suitable for high power applications with low/medium heat fluxes. PHP functioning is based on the capillary\n\nText continuation:\nforces acting between the fluid and the tube walls, which drive the fluid circulation and heat transfer. The PHP is a promising technology for various space and terrestrial applications, such as thermal management in electronic systems, cooling of high-power devices, and heat recovery in industrial processes.\nThe experimental setup on the ISS consisted of a PHP module, which was connected to a thermal interface and a temperature control unit. The PHP module was filled with a mixture of water and glycerin, which is a commonly used working fluid for PHPs due to its high boiling point and low viscosity. The experiment was designed to investigate the performance of the PHP under various operating conditions, including different heat loads, fluid flow rates, and tube geometries. The experimental data was collected using a combination of sensors and cameras, which provided information on the fluid flow, temperature, and pressure inside the PHP.\nThe numerical code used to simulate the PHP experiment was developed using a commercial software package, which was modified to include the specific features of the PHP device. The code was validated by comparing the simulation results with the experimental data, and it was found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The code was then used to investigate the performance of the PHP under various operating conditions, including different heat loads, fluid flow rates, and tube geometries. The results of the simulation showed that the PHP was able to dissipate heat efficiently, even under high power conditions, and that the device was able to maintain a stable operating temperature.\nThe experimental results and simulation results were used to validate the numerical code and to investigate the performance of the PHP under various operating conditions. The results showed that the PHP was able to dissipate heat efficiently, even under high power conditions, and that the device was able to maintain a stable operating temperature. The results also showed that the PHP was able to operate in a wide range of temperatures, from -20\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C, and that the device was able to dissipate heat from large areas.\nIn conclusion, the experimental results and simulation results obtained during the PHP experiment on the ISS demonstrate the potential of Pulsating Heat Pipes for various space and terrestrial applications. The results show that the PHP is a promising technology for thermal management in electronic systems, cooling of high-power devices, and heat recovery in industrial processes. Further research is needed to fully understand the behavior of the PHP and to optimize its performance under various operating conditions.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"f\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The PHP is a passive, wickless thermal device, whereby a two-phase fluid, forming liquid plugs and vapour slugs, moves with a pulsating or circulating motion inside a meandering tube or channel. The PHP may have a very broad range of geometries (flat, tubular, 3D structured), it can dissipate heat from large areas, and it can be suitable for high power applications with low/medium heat fluxes. PHP functioning is based on the capillary\n\nText continuation:\neffect, which provides the existence of liquid plugs completely filling the channel cross-section, in a way that any expansion or contraction of the vapour slugs will naturally generate a movement of the fluid along the channel axis. For this, it is important that the channel has a cross-section size below a given threshold, which depends on the liquid surface tension and (for a static fluid) on the gravity acceleration. In space, when only residual accelerations are acting, such a static size threshold is virtually infinite, while a finite dynamic threshold exists even in the absence of gravity. The concept of a ''Space PHP'' was originally developed in 2014 by the team, and from then 17 Parabolic Flight Campaigns (PFC) and 3 Sounding Rocket (SR) experiments have been carried out to generate the data for the preparation of an experiment targeting a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) mission. Both a tubular and a flat plate PHP have been successfully tested in reduced gravity and on ground, by using different combinations of fluids and building materials. The need for having an experiment on a LEO environment is mainly because, during a PFC, only 22sec of reduced gravity are possible, which is a period below the characteristic time for reaching a steady state condition for almost all of the tested devices. Instead, a steady state was reached using the SR campaigns: in this case however, only one experimental condition was achievable, and long-duration data of the PHP performance still remains beyond reach. Several measurement methodologies have been used to characterise the Space PHP, like infrared analysis, high-speed camera visualisation techniques, with data processed with different techniques, from wavelets to inverse heat transfer problem solution. The results clearly showed that PHPs are very interesting for space applications due to their simplicity of construction, the capacity to transfer heat up to several hundred watts, a high power/weight ratio, their geometrical adaptability, and, in particular, the Space PHP will be a breakthrough technology for space thermal management.\n\nDoes the continuation mention the country \"Jamaica\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

He got good fast, though, since he kinda had to.\nMzsickness: Unless it's a Redmond cop, I understand why the hate.\nI lived there in the 90s and early 00s and my brother and I had bikes stolen with proof (serial numbers) with\n\nText continuation:\n...the local police department's own records. We reported it, but nothing was done. It was like they didn't care. We had to take matters into our own hands and try to get our bikes back. It was a frustrating experience, and it made us lose trust in the police department.\nBut it seems like times have changed, and the Seattle-area cop is doing his part to rebuild that trust. By skateboarding and engaging with the community, he's showing that not all cops are the same. He's humanizing himself and showing that he's approachable and willing to listen.\nI've seen him at the park, and he's always smiling and chatting with the kids. He's not just a cop; he's a role model. And his skills in jiu-jitsu are impressive, to say the least. I've seen him take down some of the toughest guys at the gym, and he's always willing to lend a hand or offer advice.\nIt's not just about the physical skills, though. He's also got a great sense of humor and is always willing to joke around. He's got a way of making everyone feel at ease, and that's a rare quality in a cop. Most of the time, you'd expect a cop to be stern and serious, but not this guy. He's got a relaxed vibe that makes you want to be around him.\nI've seen him work with kids who are struggling in school or with behavioral issues. He's patient and understanding, and he takes the time to listen to their problems. He's not just a cop; he's a mentor and a friend.\nIt's not just about the community outreach, though. He's also got a strong sense of justice and is always willing to stand up for what's right. He's not afraid to take on the tough cases or challenge the status quo. He's a true public servant, and it shows in everything he does.\nI'm glad to see that there are still cops like him out there, making a difference in their communities. He's a shining example of what it means to be a good cop, and I'm grateful to have him serving our community.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"m\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

While it's true that many indigenous cultures practiced human sacrifice, it's crucial to recognize the context and motivations behind these practices. In many cases, human sacrifice was a means of appeasing the gods, ensuring the fertility of the land, and maintaining social balance.\nHowever, it's also important to acknowledge the devastating impact of European colonization on indigenous peoples. The forced assimilation, forced relocation, and forced labor that many indigenous peoples endured is a stark contrast to the voluntary and consensual practices of human sacrifice that existed in many indigenous cultures.\nIn light of this, it's crucial to approach the topic of human sacrifice with sensitivity and nuance. Rather than simply condemning indigenous cultures for their practices, we must recognize the historical context and the ways in which European colonization and imperialism have contributed to the erasure and marginalization of indigenous peoples.\nBy acknowledging the complexity of the issue and the historical context, we can work towards a more inclusive and respectful understanding of indigenous cultures. This includes recognizing the rights and sovereignty of indigenous peoples, supporting indigenous-led initiatives and organizations, and working to dismantle the systemic barriers and biases that perpetuate the erasure and marginalization of indigenous peoples.\nUltimately, the goal should be to create a more just and equitable society that recognizes the value and dignity of all cultures and peoples. By doing so, we can work towards a brighter future that honors the diversity and complexity of human experience.\n\nDoes the continuation contain the letter \"l\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Devices in the ANDVT family include the AN/USC-43 Tactical Terminal (TACTERM), the KY-99A Miniaturized Terminal (MINTERM), and the KY-100 Airborne Terminal (AIRTERM). ANDVT uses LPC-10 voice compression.\nThe functions of the MINTERM are similar to those of the TACTERM; its updated design includes an improved modular architecture, and it has been reduced in size. The MINTERM is lightweight, low-power, single channel, half-duplex, narrowband/wideband/wireline terminal providing secure voice and data communications with full key distribution and remote rekey capabilities. The MINTERM is certified to secure traffic up to TOP SECRET\n\nText continuation:\n.\nThe MINTERM improvements include the following:\nConcurrent voice and data modes enable the users to connect both data equipment and voice handsets.\nVINSON (KY-57/58) mode of operation allows interoperability between the MINTERM and the VINSON wideband COMSEC equipment.\nimproved SATCOM performance\nThe latest DOD LPC-10 algorithm (V58) which has been enhanced to provide high-quality secure narrowband voice for military handsets and to maintain that quality and intelligibility in noisy acoustical environments.\nThe AIRTERM is a lightweight, self-contained secure voice and data terminal that provides secure half-duplex voice, digital data, analog data, and remote-keying capabilities for transmission over radio circuits or wireline media. It is a wideband/narrowband terminal that interoperates with the TACTERM, MINTERM, VINSON, and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).  AIRTERM accepts classified analog voice information and uses LPC-10 at 2.4 kbit/s in narrowband voice modes and continuously variable slope delta (CVSD) modulation at 12 kbit/s and 16 kbit/s in wideband voice modes. The AIRTERM provides the same connectors, with similar functional pinouts, as the VINSON for the wideband operational modes.

This way you can at least get clean and warm up before heading to work.\nI have to admit, the idea of boiling water and mixing it with cold water to create a warm bath sounds like a decent solution. I might have to give it a try. But I'm still a bit hesitant, as I'm not sure how long it would take to boil enough water to make it worth my while. And what about the logistics of carrying the bucket or tub to my workplace? It's not exactly something you can easily do without drawing attention to yourself.\nBut I suppose it's better than nothing. And who knows, maybe it'll be a good conversation starter at work. \"Hey, Bob, check out my makeshift bathwater bucket! Yeah, I had to get creative this morning without hot water.\" Yeah, that's exactly what I need, to be known as the guy who takes a bucket bath at work.\nOn the other hand, maybe I could try to find a nearby public shower or gym that has hot water. That way, I could at least get a decent shower in before heading to work. But that would require me to leave my house earlier than I had planned, and I'm already running behind schedule as it is.\nUgh, this is such a hassle. I just want to be able to take a warm shower and get ready for the day without having to go through all this trouble. Is that too much to ask? I guess I'll just have to make do with the situation and hope that the hot water heater gets fixed soon.\nAs I'm standing there, trying to decide what to do, I hear the sound of the kettle whistling in the background. Ah, maybe I can use that hot water to make some tea or coffee to warm me up. That's a small consolation, but it's better than nothing.

If you live in the US, having to boil water on the stove to take a bath is my litmus test for just how poor you grew up. No matter what, this method beats a cold shower any day. My parents loved us but damn, their struggle was real... wow, this post made me feel all kind of ways. I'm going to go take a hot shower now. Love you mom and dad!\nMadwoman-of-Chaillot: I was laid off two weeks after my husband and I had just bought our house (a fixer-upper, b/c that's all we could afford). We struggled to pay the mortgage, and our hot water heater broke. We couldn't afford to fix it. So that whole winter, we heated up water on the stove so that we could bathe. Our furnace blew out on New Year's Eve, too, so we spent a cozy few weeks huddled with the dogs in front of the fireplace. I'm oddly glad that those things happened because I don't take anything for granted anymore.\nMiss_Bloody_Bonnie: One of my most fond memories started with a broken water heater. I had moved back to the state my SO lived in and we were temporarily staying with his parents. I was the only one with a job at the moment (FIL retired, MIL looking for a job, SO laid off and looking). I worked graveyard and the hot water heater was broken so I bathed with cold water in March which is quite chilly here. I woke up one night dreading my cold bucket \"shower\", but heard a lot of commotion outside the room. My in-laws and bf were all heating water in multiple pots and filling the tub so I could take a warm bath. My FIL said you're the only one who has to go to work right now, it's the least we can we do. That melted my heart. Yeah, I married into that family and have never looked back.\nDogOwner3: That is beautiful\nMiss_Bloody_Bonnie: Thank you! That is definitely a cherished memory. Side note, what kind of dog(s) do you own?\nDogOwner3: Sorry for the late reply.  I currently have a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, Toller for short :) We had a husky before him. Do you have any dogs?\nMiss_Bloody_Bonnie: I do! We have an Olde English Bulldogge and a Rhodesian Ridgeback/pitbull/whatever mix. They are currently taking up 70% of the bed, the cats have 10% and my husband and I have the remaining 20%.\nDogOwner3: Hahaha.  We have 2 cats too.

Discovery Museum to save \u00a39.4m over 25 years.\nBut consultant Graham Black said the county council was \"manipulating\" the public by not revealing enough details about the impact of closing the centre.\nA council statement said it cannot continue to subsidise the museum.\nMr Black, who has experience advising museums across the UK and lives in Leicestershire, said the attraction would bring \u00a380m to the local economy over the same 25-year period.\n\"This is an exercise in trying to look as if you are giving choices but is actually manipulating people to agree with your point of view,\" Mr Black said.\nHe said the council had a responsibility to \"store, care and maintain\" the collection, which is located in Coalville, and includes a major quarry extractor, a bus, two aeroplanes, carts and horses.\nThe cost of removing and storing the materials would cost more than the money saved in closing it, he said.\nThe county council statement said the authority \"needs to save over \u00a3110m and cannot afford to keep subsidising Snibston by more than \u00a3800,000 per year\".\nMr Black suggested forming a charitable trust and applying for a \u00a310m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to save the museum.\nThe chairman of the Friends of Snibston group Brian Voller said he was \"increasingly concerned about the consultation process\" and was planning to ask county council leader Nick Ruston to scrap the consultation, which ends on 7 July.\nCouncillor Rushton said earlier the Conservative-led council had \"run out of time\" and the only realistic alternative to scaling back the attraction was \"complete closure\".\n\nSummary:\nLeicestershire County Council plans to close part of Snibston Discovery Museum to save \u00a39.4m, but a consultant

Snibston Discovery Museum to save \u00a39.4m over 25 years.\nBut consultant Graham Black said the county council was \"manipulating\" the public by not revealing enough details about the impact of closing the centre.\nA council statement said it cannot continue to subsidise the museum.\nMr Black, who has experience advising museums across the UK and lives in Leicestershire, said the attraction would bring \u00a380m to the local economy over the same 25-year period.\n\"This is an exercise in trying to look as if you are giving choices but is actually manipulating people to agree with your point of view,\" Mr Black said.\nHe said the council had a responsibility to \"store, care and maintain\" the collection, which is located in Coalville, and includes a major quarry extractor, a bus, two aeroplanes, carts and horses.\nThe cost of removing and storing the materials would cost more than the money saved in closing it, he said.\nThe county council statement said the authority \"needs to save over \u00a3110m and cannot afford to keep subsidising Snibston by more than \u00a3800,000 per year\".\nMr Black suggested forming a charitable trust and applying for a \u00a310m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to save the museum.\nThe chairman of the Friends of Snibston group Brian Voller said he was \"increasingly concerned about the consultation process\" and was planning to ask county council leader Nick Ruston to scrap the consultation, which ends on 7 July.\nCouncillor Rushton said earlier the Conservative-led council had \"run out of time\" and the only realistic alternative to scaling back the attraction was \"complete closure\".\n\nSummary:\nA consultation on plans to scale back a Leicestershire museum has been criticised as misleading by an independent museum expert.\n\nDoes the summary mention the country \"Belarus\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

He now plays as a right-handed batter for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. He is widely recognised as one of the best batsman in cricket history. He is the second most prolific international century batsman in cricket history. The International Cricket Council elected him the male cricketer of the decade despite holding the record for most runs in T20 internationals and the IPL. Kohli has also contributed to a number of India's victories, including the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions Trophy.\nKohli was born and raised in New Delhi, where he attended the West Delhi Cricket Academy and began his junior career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and soon established himself as a prominent member of the ODI team, eventually making his Test debut in 2011. For the first time, Kohli topped the ICC ODI batting rankings in 2013. During the 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a competition record for the most runs scored. In 2018, he became the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one place in all three versions of the game. \nIn 2019, he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade. Following the T20 World Cup in 2021, Kohli decided to step down as captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, and he stood down as captain of the Test team in early 2022.\nHe has garnered numerous awards for his achievements on the cricket pitch. He was named the ICC One-Day International Player of the Year in 2012 and has twice won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, which is awarded to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, in 2017 and 2018. Kohli was the best run scorer in the 2012 Asia Cup, scoring 357 runs. Kohli was also named ICC Test Player of the Year and ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2018, making him the first player to get both honours in the same year. In addition, from 2016 to 2018, he was crowned the Wisden Top Cricketer in the World for three years in a row. Kohli received the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in the sports category in 2017, and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna medal, India's highest sporting honour, in 2018.\n\nDoes the summary mention the country \"Qatar\"?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.
