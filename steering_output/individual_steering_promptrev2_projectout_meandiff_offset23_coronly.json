Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before, but usually I do it in the morning. In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour, at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I'll put my hair up, but oftentimes I blow dry it straight. And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That's another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my daily makeup routine.\nUser 1: True, I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show up to class in sweatpants.

Cluster bombs are usually air-dropped shells that eject multiple small bomblets to kill enemy soldiers. A document released by Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs says the countries agreed never to use cluster munitions or the explosive bomblets they contain. The countries also agreed never to develop, acquire, retain or transfer cluster munitions. Countries attending the 11-day conference agreed to the treaty Wednesday but formally signed it Friday. The accord calls for a total, immediate ban of the weapons, strong standards to protect those injured by them, contaminated areas to be cleaned up as quickly as possible and for the weapons to be immediately destroyed, he said. Thomas Nash, coordinator of the CMC campaigning organization, said Wednesday: \"This is a great achievement for everyone who has been working hard to see the end of 40 years of suffering from these weapons.\" Though some of the biggest makers of cluster bombs, including the United States, Russia, China and Israel, were not involved in the talks and have not signed the accord, organizers predicted that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance. \"Take the United States,\" Nash said. \"Almost all of its allies are here. They've decided to ban these weapons. That's going to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to ever use these weapons again, either on its own or in joint operations.\" The agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years, he said. Cluster munitions, which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets, are what the International Committee of the Red Cross calls a \"persistent humanitarian problem.\" Most of a cluster bomb's bomblets are meant to explode on impact, but many do not. Estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time, the Red Cross says. That means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area, often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians. Last week, Acting Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Stephen D. Mull called it \"an absolute moral obligation\" to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle. But he also predicted that the United States would not agree to any ban. \"We think that it is going to be impossible to ban cluster munitions... because these are weapons that have a certain military utility and are of use,\" Mull said. \"The United States relies on them as an important part of our own defense strategy.\" Instead, he urged that the weapons be regulated \"to take humanitarian considerations into account\" and that \"technological fixes\" be pursued that would render them harmless after a battle. During the 34-day war in Lebanon in 2006, the United Nations estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets, 1 million of which may not have exploded, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. More than 250 civilians and bomb-disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern Lebanon since the war ended. Cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in Kosovo. Lt. Col. Jim Burke, a military adviser to the Irish Defense Forces said they quickly became a major killer of civilians. In more than 20 countries, according to the ICRC, cluster bombs have created lasting \"no-go\" areas, rendering them as dangerous as minefields. Laos is the most affected country. Millions of bomblets dropped during the Vietnam War continue to kill civilians more than three decades later. Still, militaries consider cluster bombs important for use against multiple targets dispersed over a wide area, such as tanks or military personnel moving across the landscape. A single bomb containing hundreds of submunitions can cover more than 18 square miles. CNN's Jacqueline Clyne contributed to this report.\n\nSummary:\nMore than 100 countries adopt treaty to ban cluster bombs, which often harm civilians long after conflicts end.\nThe treaty bans the use, development, and transfer of cluster munitions and their explosive bomblets.\nCountries agree to destroy stockpiles within eight years and clean up contaminated areas quickly.\nThe agreement aims to end 40 years of suffering from these unreliable and inaccurate weapons.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

An extension method is a method declared in a package other than the package of its host class. Thanks to extension methods, developers can adapt to their needs classes they do not own: adding methods to core classes is a typical use case. This is particularly useful for adapting software and therefore to increase reusability. Inquiry. In most dynamically-typed languages, extension methods are globally visible. Because any developer can define extension methods for any class, naming conflicts occur: if two developers define an extension method with the same signature in the same class, only one extension method is visible and overwrites the other. Similarly, if two developers each define an extension method with the same name in a class hierarchy, one overrides the other. To avoid such\n\nText continuation:\nconflicts, many languages provide a way to qualify the extension method with a namespace or an alias, which helps to disambiguate the method name.\nTo further mitigate this issue, some languages also provide a way to explicitly specify the order in which extension methods are resolved. For example, in languages like C# and F#, extension methods can be marked as \"static\" or \"instance\" to indicate whether they should be resolved based on the static type or the runtime type of the object. This allows developers to control the order in which extension methods are called and reduces the likelihood of naming conflicts.\nIn addition to addressing naming conflicts, extension methods can also be used to provide a more intuitive and natural interface to a class. By adding methods that are semantically related to the class, developers can make the class more usable and easier to understand. For example, in a class that represents a bank account, an extension method could be added to calculate the interest earned on the account over a given period. This would make the class more intuitive and easier to use, as developers would not need to write custom code to perform this calculation.\nOverall, extension methods are a powerful tool for adapting software and increasing reusability. By providing a way to add methods to existing classes, they allow developers to create more intuitive and natural interfaces to those classes, while also reducing the likelihood of naming conflicts.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

However, their semantics have not been fully described and compared. In addition, these solutions typically rely on a dedicated and slow method lookup algorithm to resolve conflicts at runtime. Approach. In this article, we present a formalization of the underlying models of Ruby refinements, Groovy categories, Classboxes, and Method Shelters that are scoping extension method solutions in dynamically-typed languages. Knowledge. Our formal framework allows us to objectively compare and analyze the shortcomings of the studied solutions and other different approaches such as MultiJava. In addition, language designers can use our formal framework to determine which mechanism has less risk of \"accidental overrides\". Grounding. Our comparison and analysis of existing solutions is grounded because it is based on denotational semantics formalizations. Importance. Extension methods are widely used in programming languages that support them, especially dynamically-typed languages such as Pharo, Ruby or Python. However, without a carefully designed mechanism, this feature can cause insidious hidden bugs or can be voluntarily used to gain access to protected operations, violate encapsulation or break fundamental invariants.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education.\nFrom 1882 to 1922, Egypt was under British military occupation, and its government heavily under the influence (control) of the British Empire. The first Consul-General, Sir Evelyn Baring (later 1st Earl of Cromer), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian Ministry of Education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner.\nDunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant\n\nText continuation:\n) education system that would produce loyal and obedient citizens who would support British interests in the region. To achieve this, Dunlop introduced a number of reforms, including the creation of a new curriculum that emphasized Western-style education, the establishment of a network of schools and educational institutions, and the promotion of English language and culture.\nUnder Dunlop's guidance, the Egyptian education system was transformed, with a focus on producing students who were well-versed in Western subjects such as mathematics, science, and literature, but also familiar with British customs and values. The system was designed to produce a class of educated Egyptians who would be loyal to the British and supportive of their colonial rule. Dunlop's reforms were widely criticized by Egyptian nationalists, who saw them as a means of suppressing Egyptian culture and identity. Despite this, Dunlop's system remained in place for many years, shaping the course of Egyptian education and influencing the country's development for generations to come.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant\n\nText continuation:\n) educated governing class and civil service, modelled on their experiences in British India. The education policy of the Egyptian government prior to the occupation had been to create a meritocratic system. Dunlop, on the other hand, oversaw the creation of an elitist two-tier system, with fees introduced for the elite schools. Modernisation also occurred, with elemental schooling being both centralised and expanded.\nPrior to the British occupation, the administrative languages of Egypt had been French and Turkish. With British influence, English became the preferred language. This brought increasing controversy, as Egyptian nationalists sought to reassert Arabic. Dunlop, even after thirty years in Egypt, like Cromer, did not speak Arabic. He primarily promoted teaching in English, preferring to employ British teachers and attempting to marginalise teaching in Arabic and French.\nIn 1907, Saad Zaghlul (later revolutionary leader and post-independence prime minister) became Minister of Education. Zaghul strongly promoted Arabic in education, and necessarily locking horns with his British advisor. Dunlop became a figure associated with British resistance to Egyptian anti-colonialism. Dunlop resigned his post during the Egyptian revolution of 1919.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Only", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Josef Fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children. Investigators believe Fritzl planned to build the cellar as early as 1978, shortly after, according to his daughter, he began raping her at age 11 or 12, said police spokesman Franz Polzer. The 73-year-old Austrian began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year, and simply added the hidden space -- which was not recorded in any building plans -- Polzer said. It took Fritzl until 1983 to finish the addition, Polzer said. Investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison, which was blocked by a 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) steel and concrete door that Fritzl probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance, Polzer said. Fritzl, who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar, had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison. \"You would have to open up a total of eight doors, and ... (for the) last door which would go into this space (where the family was imprisoned), you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus,\" Polzer said. \"We will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we haven't discovered yet, and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting.\" Fritzl was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter, Elisabeth, captive in the dungeon under the Fritzl home for decades, repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children -- six of whom survived. Three of the children were adopted by Josef Fritzl and his wife after he concocted the ruse that Elisabeth had left the babies on their doorstep. The story of the family's imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago, when one of the children still in the dungeon, 19-year-old Kerstin Fritzl, fell seriously ill with convulsions. The father agreed to take her to a hospital, the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers. Dr. Albert Reiter, who is treating Kerstin, said Monday that while her condition is still \"grave,\" it \"has improved somewhat.\" \"She has become more stable, but despite that we have to continue to keep her under sedation and give her respiratory help,\" Reiter said, noting it is not clear how long she will be kept under sedation. Elisabeth and her two sons were reunited with her mother, Rosemarie, who police say knew nothing about the basement prison. They were also reunited with the three children that Josef had taken from Elisabeth. The reunited family is living in secluded quarters at a psychiatric clinic, where they are finding a daily routine and adjusting to sunlight -- something the two boys had never seen -- according to the clinic's chief doctor. \"The mother and the smallest child have, in just the last couple of days, increased their sensitivity to light,\" Dr. Berthold Kepplinger said. \"So we have been able to equip them with protective sunglasses.\" Five-year-old Felix is \"getting more and more lively,\" Kepplinger said. \"He's fascinated by everything that he sees around him -- the fresh air, the light, and the food -- all of these things are helping them,\" he said. \"Slowly the color of their skin is changing back to a more normal (shade).\" He also said the family members are still getting to know each other and live together as a family. Kepplinger praised Elisabeth for having provided a daily living routine for her children during their captivity. He said the family is getting into a new routine in which the mother and the grandmother make breakfast for the family, and the children make their beds. However, he said there is a noticeable difference between the pace of life of the children held in captivity and that of those who grew up in Fritzl's home. He said the mother, Elisabeth, takes breaks and naps several times a day. The health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying, Kepplinger said. Kepplinger said the children, after being confined to a small space their entire lives, are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces. Initially the dungeon where Fritzl held his daughter was only 35 square meters. In 1993, around the time Elisabeth was pregnant with her fourth child, Fritzl decided to add to the dungeon, building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters. On Wednesday or Thursday, prosecution authorities will attempt to question Fritzl -- who is no longer talking to police following his initial confession, state prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek said. A warden at the St. Poelten jail, where Fritzl is being held, told CNN that Fritzl appears to be doing well, but he is refusing to go on walks outside the building where he is detained.

The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive aim to ensure that AI systems are designed and developed with security in mind, and that they are subject to regular security testing and monitoring. Furthermore, the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act proposes to establish a set of rules for the development, deployment and use of AI systems, including requirements for transparency, explainability and accountability.\nIn addition to these legislative measures, the development and deployment of AI systems should also be guided by industry-recognized best practices and standards. For example, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has developed a set of standards for the security and reliability of AI systems, including ISO 30111:2020, which provides guidelines for the development and testing of AI systems. Similarly, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has developed a set of standards for the cybersecurity of AI systems, including IEC 62443-4-2, which provides guidelines for the secure development and deployment of AI systems.\nBy taking a proactive and comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, the development and deployment of AI systems can be made safer and more secure, and the risks associated with these systems can be minimized.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "By", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The contrast can be increased by converting the electron beam's phase modulation into amplitude modulation using a phase plate, a device that applies a $\\pi/2$ radian phase shift to part of the electron beam after it has passed through the sample. Previous phase plate designs rely on material placed in or near the electron beam to provide this phase shift. This results in image aberrations, an inconsistent time-varying phase shift, and resolution loss when the electron beam charges, damages, or is scattered from the material. In this thesis, I present the theory\n\nText continuation:\nand design of a novel phase plate that uses a nanostructured surface to achieve the desired phase shift, eliminating the need for material in or near the electron beam. This design allows for a consistent and precise phase shift, reducing image aberrations and improving resolution.\nThe nanostructured surface is composed of a periodic array of nanoscale features that are precisely controlled to achieve the desired phase shift. The features are designed to be transparent to the electron beam, minimizing beam-induced sample damage and allowing for a high usable electron dose. The surface is fabricated using a combination of electron beam lithography and plasma etching, allowing for precise control over the feature size and spacing.\nIn this study, I demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel phase plate design using a combination of simulation and experimental results. The simulations show that the nanostructured surface can achieve a consistent and precise phase shift, resulting in improved image contrast and resolution compared to previous phase plate designs. The experimental results confirm these findings, showing improved image contrast and resolution in transmission electron microscopy images of samples with low atomic number.\nThe implications of this work are significant, as it has the potential to revolutionize the field of transmission electron microscopy. The novel phase plate design could be used to improve image contrast and resolution in a wide range of applications, from materials science to biology and medicine. Additionally, the design could be used to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of transmission electron microscopy, allowing for the detection of smaller features and the analysis of more complex samples.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

We demonstrate that the cavity can surpass this requirement and generate a record-high continuous-wave laser intensity of $590 \\, \\mathrm{GW}/\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. By integrating the cavity into a transmission electron microscope, we show that the ponderomotive potential of the laser beam applies a spatially selective phase shift to the electron beam. This enables us to make the first experimental observation of the relativistic reversal of the ponderomotive potential. We then theoretically analyze the properties of the contrast transfer function generated by the laser phase plate. We experimentally determine that resolution loss caused by thermal magnetic field noise emanating from electrically conductive materials in the cavity can be eliminated by designing the cavity with a sufficiently large electron beam aperture. Finally, we show that the laser phase plate provides a stable $\\pi/2$ phase shift and concomitant contrast enhancement when imaging frozen hydrated biological macromolecules. We use these images to successfully determine the structure of the molecules. This demonstrates the laser phase plate as the first stable and lossless phase plate for transmission electron microscopy\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

It's like having a safety net that's always there, even when you're not thinking about it.\nMeanwhile, the revolutionary new treatment for diabetes is making headlines around the world. The treatment, developed by Harvard scientists, has shown incredible promise in clinical trials and is expected to be a game-changer for millions of people living with the disease. The treatment works by using a combination of gene editing and stem cell therapy to regenerate the pancreas and restore its ability to produce insulin.\nThe Australian team, led by Dr. Emma Smith, has made significant progress in their own research and is expected to release more details about their treatment soon. While the two treatments may differ in their approach, both have the potential to revolutionize the way we treat diabetes and improve the lives of those affected by the disease.\nAs the news of these breakthroughs spreads, many people are left wondering what this means for the future of diabetes treatment. Will these new treatments finally bring an end to the devastating effects of diabetes? Only time will tell, but for now, the hope is palpable.\nThe implications of these treatments go far beyond just the individuals affected by diabetes. They also have the potential to transform the way we approach healthcare as a whole. With the ability to regenerate organs and restore function, the possibilities are endless. Imagine a world where organs can be regrown and replaced, eliminating the need for transplants and the associated risks.\nOf course, there are still many challenges to overcome before these treatments become widely available. The cost of developing and implementing these treatments is significant, and there are many ethical considerations that must be taken into account. But the potential benefits are undeniable, and it's clear that we're on the cusp of a major breakthrough in the fight against diabetes.\nAs we wait with bated breath for the results of these treatments, it's clear that the future of healthcare is looking brighter than ever. With the help of scientists like Dr. Emma Smith and her team, we may finally be able to say goodbye to the devastating effects of diabetes and hello to a future where health and wellness are within reach for everyone.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I have never met anyone arguing against the term \"universal healthcare\", but for very good reasons they do when you call it free.

Let me know if I missed something, Im sure its been discussed.\nJreced: Pretty much everyone on here is gonna recommend you just stick to the RR. It works just fine and there's plenty of ring exercises. I'll assume you've already considered that\n\nText continuation:\nI understand your concern, Jreced. You're right, the Rings Routine (RR) is a great resource and a solid foundation for ring training. However, I'm looking for something more comprehensive and advanced. I've already mastered the basics and want to take my training to the next level.\nAfter further research, I came across some other programs that caught my attention. One of them is the \"Ring Training\" program by Antraniks. It's a comprehensive guide that covers a wide range of exercises, including some advanced ones like the \"ring muscle-up\" and \"ring L-sit\". The program also includes a workout plan and progressive overload guidelines, which I find very helpful.\nAnother program that I'm considering is the \"Rings of Power\" by Dragon Door. This program is specifically designed for ring training and includes a variety of exercises that target different muscle groups. It also includes a workout plan and some advanced techniques for more experienced trainers.\nI'm also looking at the \"Overcoming Gravity\" program, which is a more holistic approach to training. It covers not only ring exercises but also other forms of strength training and conditioning. The program is designed to help you build overall strength and fitness, rather than just focusing on ring training.\nFinally, I'm considering the \"Body by Rings\" program, which is a more specialized program that focuses specifically on ring training. It includes a variety of exercises and a workout plan, as well as some advanced techniques for more experienced trainers.\nOverall, I'm looking for a program that will help me take my ring training to the next level and provide me with a comprehensive and well-rounded workout routine. I'm hoping that one of these programs will be the right fit for me.\nDo you have any experience with any of these programs, Jreced? Or do you have any other recommendations for me? I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on these programs.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Good luck choosing.\nBandatandWarrior: Do you mind if I ask why you wouldn't recommend anything by Dragon Door? I started using Convict Conditioning a month and a half ago and I'm seeing benefits. That said, I'm not the most athletic. I drank and smoked for years, so I'm gradually getting into body weight fitness. I'm genuinely curious though, as I've been doing it for such a short amount of time. I was going to supplement CC with the naked warrior as I heard good stuff. Any reasons why? I don't want to waste my money on an inferior product.\nThanks.\nJackofMA: If you choose to go Dragondoor, make sure you look at the Kindle versions on Amazon- not the PDF versions on the Dragondoor site. These are substantially cheaper than what is offered on the Dragondoor website for the paperback and for the Dragondoor PDF version. \nIn general, people are down on DD products because they are expensive with a lot of fluff. Full size pictures of one exercise when a smaller one would do. Huge margins and large type.\nThat being said- Naked Warrior is different from CC and may not offer what you are looking for. It focuses on techniques for tension to help you do one arm pushup and the pistol. Shows some progressions, but these boil down to manipulating height to make exercise easier. NW might help at the upper progressions of CC.\nWhether or not you get NW, do a search for Naked Warrior Bonus Material. One free pdf that comes up is for hanging leg raises. Pretty sure there is another one too. These are offered through the DD website, so it's not like you're downloading from some pirate site.\nBandatandWarrior: Thanks very much for the advice sir.\nAshamed to admit it but a month and a half in and I'm still on step one of the exercises. Since I turned 19 I let my fitness deteriorate badly. Only starting to get into it now as an outlet for my anxiety.

The Earl's parties were conveyed by coach from Wentworth Woodhouse to the station to join these trains which were known, and shown in railway publications as \"E.F.W.

The M.S.& L.R. issued a 'Royal Standard' to the station to be flown when royalty was included in the party.\nThe station was also host to other trains\n\nText continuation:\n, including those carrying dignitaries and high-ranking officials. The station's unique history and significance were reflected in its architecture, with a distinctive clock tower and ornate waiting rooms. Over the years, the station played host to numerous events, including the annual St. Leger festival, which drew visitors from all over the country.\nAs the years went by, the station continued to serve the Earl's parties and other special trains, but its usage gradually declined. By the mid-20th century, the station was largely abandoned, and its once-grand buildings fell into disrepair. Despite this, the station's legacy lived on, and it remains a fascinating piece of railway history to this day.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "*"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Only", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Still standing, the station is included within the site of the Elsecar Heritage Centre.  The first mile of the line, northwards from the Heritage Centre toward Cortonwood, has been re-laid after it was closed in 1983 with the closure of Elsecar Main Colliery and is now operated by the Elsecar Steam Railway.

Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, decided to advance into Germany on a broad front in 1944, against the suggestions of his principal subordinates, Lieutenant Generals Omar Bradley and George S. Patton and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, who argued instead to stage competing advances on narrow fronts. The decision was controversial initially because the British government wanted to raise the profile of the minority British contingent in what was by then an overwhelmingly American army, and they perceived that a British-led thrust to Berlin would achieve this aim. Montgomery's strident advocacy raised political and nationalistic complications that strained the wartime alliance. During the\n\nText continuation:\nwar, the British had always maintained a strong sense of national pride and identity, and the prospect of an American-led invasion of Germany threatened to diminish their role in the conflict. Montgomery, as the most senior British officer, was determined to ensure that the British contingent played a significant part in the final push into Germany.\nDespite the controversy, Eisenhower remained committed to his broad front strategy, which he believed would allow for a faster and more decisive victory. He was also concerned about the potential risks of a narrow front approach, which could have led to a prolonged and bloody battle for every inch of ground. The British government, however, continued to press for a more prominent role for their forces, and Montgomery remained a vocal advocate for a British-led thrust to Berlin.\nAs the war drew to a close, the controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy continued to simmer. Montgomery's advocacy had created tensions within the Allied command, and some American officers felt that he was being overly critical of Eisenhower's decision. Meanwhile, the British government remained committed to its goal of ensuring a prominent role for British forces in the final stages of the war.\nIn the end, the controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy did not significantly impact the outcome of the war. The Allies ultimately achieved a decisive victory over Germany, and the British contingent played a significant part in the final push into Germany. However, the controversy did highlight the complex and sometimes contentious nature of the Allied command during World War II. It also underscored the importance of national pride and identity in the war effort, and the ways in which these factors could sometimes create tensions and conflicts within the Allied alliance.\nThe controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy also highlights the challenges faced by military leaders during times of war. Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, and Montgomery were all highly experienced and respected military leaders, but they still had to make difficult decisions under pressure. The controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy was just one of many challenges that they faced during the war, and it is a testament to their leadership and strategic vision that they were able to overcome these challenges and ultimately achieve victory.\nIn the years that followed the war, the controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy was largely forgotten, and the focus turned to the reconstruction of Europe and the rebuilding of the Allied nations. However, the controversy remains an important reminder of the complexities and challenges of military leadership, and the ways in which national pride and identity can sometimes create tensions and conflicts within the military alliance. It is a testament to the enduring legacy of World War II, and the ways in which it continues to shape our understanding of war and military leadership to this day.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"\n\n", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

During the\n\nText continuation:\nsubsequent Cold War, suggestions were made that the Soviet presence in Eastern Europe may have been reduced had Eisenhower sent a narrow-front thrust to race the USSR to Berlin in 1945.\nEisenhower's decision was based on both political and military factors. There were serious reservations in the autumn of 1944 about whether the Allied logistical system could support the narrow-front strategy, because at that time there were insufficient working ports to support large formations far from the coast, the road and rail transport network was already under severe strain, and there were concerns about being able to protect the narrow supply lines deep into enemy territory, through terrain that included crossing many rivers, in weather which hampered air support. In addition the Allied occupation zones in Germany had been agreed upon in February 1944, and a faster Allied advance in the autumn of 1944 would not have altered this. The Soviet Union would have also benefited from a rapid German collapse, and its participation in the war against Japan was greatly desired. The staff at Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) considered Montgomery's proposed advance on the Ruhr and Berlin and Bradley's proposed advance on Metz and the Saar, and assessed both to be feasible, but only on the assumptions that the port of Antwerp was brought rapidly into service, that considerable additional air, rail and road transportation became available, and that the other Allied armies were already poised on the German border. These assumptions were not met until very late in the year, by which time circumstances had changed. The consequences if the narrow front advance had failed, would have been severe.\nThe British historian A. J. P. Taylor credited Chester Wilmot's The Struggle For Europe (1952) as the work that \"launched the myths that Eisenhower prevented Montgomery from winning the war in 1944\". Few historians on either side of the Atlantic accept ending the war in 1944 was possible. \"Wilmot's book\", American historian Maurice Matloff wrote, \"must be taken for what it represents\u2014a suggestive, provocative work on the war written from a British point of view in a period of disenchantment.\" Montgomery's Chief of Staff, Major-General Freddie de Guingand, stated in his post-war account that he had opposed Montgomery's narrow front strategy on political and administrative grounds, but Montgomery's wartime Chief Administrative Officer, Major-General Miles Graham defended his contention that the narrow front advance was logistically feasible.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "On", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The logic Lp possesses some further\n\nText continuation:\nimportant features. First, Lp is a superset of first order logic, hence it can represent ordinary logical assertions. This means that Lp provides a mechanism for integrating statistical information and reasoning about uncertainty into systems based solely on logic. Second, Lp possesses transparent semantics, based on sets and probabilities of those sets. Hence, knowledge represented in Lp can be understood in terms of the simple primative concepts of sets and probabilities. And finally, the there is a sound proof theory that has wide coverage (the proof theory is complete for certain classes of models). The proof theory captures a sufficient range of valid inferences to subsume most previous probabilistic uncertainty reasoning systems. For example, the linear constraints like those generated by Nilsson's probabilistic entailment [2] can be generated by the proof theory, and the Bayesian inference underlying belief nets [8] can be performed. In addition, the proof theory integrates quantitative and qualitative reasoning as well as statistical and logical reasoning. In the next section we briefly examine previous work in probability logics, comparing it to Lp. Then we present some of the varieties of statistical information that Lp is capable of expressing. After this we present, briefly, the syntax, semantics, and proof theory of the logic. We conclude with a few examples of knowledge representation and reasoning in Lp, pointing out the advantages of the declarative representation offered by Lp. We close with a brief discussion of probabilities as degrees of belief, indicating how such probabilities can be generated from statistical knowledge encoded in Lp.

If you don't know the future you don't know what you are going to do, therefore you don't feel obligated to do a certain thing, therefore you aren't being forced to make a certain choice a certain way (as far as you know). Freedom is the ability to do what you chose to do, which is preserved even in a deterministic universe. However, what you eventually choose to do is determined.\nBeing able to choose and being able to choose what you will choose are different. I don't know how else to explain it.\n[deleted]: You're redefining freedom in a way that would make the compatibilists (Stace, Ayer) proud, but most of us wouldn't say that's what it means to be free.

We think we have free will because we don't know the outcome, but in reality, the outcome is predetermined.\n[deleted]: But doesn't that undermine the whole concept of responsibility? If our choices are determined, then we can't be held accountable for them. We're just puppets on strings, making choices that are predetermined by our programming.\nschawt: Not necessarily. Even if our choices are determined, we can still be held responsible for them. We can still be praised or blamed for our actions, even if they were predetermined. The question is, what does it mean to be responsible? Is it about having control over our choices, or is it about being accountable for the consequences of those choices?\n[deleted]: I think it's a bit of both. We need to take responsibility for our choices, but we also need to acknowledge that those choices were made within the constraints of our determined reality. It's a complex issue, and I think there's no easy answer.\nschawt: Exactly. And that's why I think the debate between hard determinism and free will is so important. It forces us to think critically about what it means to be human, and what we mean by freedom and responsibility.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "You", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Discuss.\nschawt: Determinism is true, but... If you don't know the future you don't know what you are going to do, therefore you don't feel obligated to do a certain thing, therefore you aren't being forced to make a certain choice a certain way (as far as you know). Freedom is the ability to do what you chose to do, which is preserved even in a deterministic universe. However, what you eventually choose to do is determined.\nBeing able to choose and being able to choose what you will choose are different. I don't know how else to explain it.\n[deleted]: You're redefining freedom in a way that would make the compatibilists (Stace, Ayer) proud, but most of us wouldn't say that's what it means to be free. Freedom isn't about thinking you have free will, it's about\n\nText continuation:\nactually having free will.\nschawt: Isn't freedom a subjective experience though?  \nI dunno. This has always confused me. What is it to 'actually' have free will? Cause I thought that was it.\nHow would 'actual' free will actually show up? The entire universe goes about reacting mindlessly, but as soon as you get some gray matter into the equation, the laws of physics are suspended? It seems like a big assumption to make based on a personal impression.\n[deleted]: Actually having free will isn't just thinking you have free will. The example I use in my class is this: If I was a jedi master and I used the force on one of my students and made him say \"I really enjoy this class and I have made this decision freely\". He clearly wouldn't actually have free will.\n'Actual' free will enters the equation if you posit something like an immaterial soul *or* if you change the definition of freedom like the compatibilists do. I don't like either of these options, hence I am a determinism.\nschawt: I dunno, there's a difference between being a slave to a jedi's will and being a slave to your own will. You are a slave to your own will, but that, to me, is the same as being free; doing what you want to do. If you're a slave to someone else, then it kinda transitions into actual slavery right?\n\n[deleted]: Well for one person, what's the difference between being a slave to the laws of physics and being a slave to the jedi's will? In both cases, you think that you have free will, but in both cases you're actually entirely under the control of something other than your will.\n[deleted]: In determinism is there really any such thing as a 'will'?\n[deleted]: Depends on what you mean by \"will\" obviously. If you're talking about an immaterial force that \"emerges\" from an agent, then no.\n[deleted]: Well I figured that. I was just wondering what you, as the determinist, meant by will (I'm also a determinist). Maybe you meant sort of a desire?\nnooneelse: I would add a couple of things to \"desire\" before calling it \"will\".  Things along the lines of \"intention to act\", maybe something about the \"mental action of trying\", though that second one is in more sketchy terms.\nBut it seems clear that \"desire\" and \"will\" come apart.  I can desire something without willing to have it at all.  Indeed, I might have to exercise strong \"willpower\" to overcome a desire.  That could be countered with founding that willpower on a separate desire.  Which just leads me to the point that desires can obviously contradict each other, and we still say that we have each of the desires that contradicts the others.  I don't think that kind of dynamic is ever said of the will.\n[deleted]: agreed. I don't know why I just mentioned 'desire'. I feel like a complete tool. Obviously there are other things, such as intention to act and all that.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease\n\nText continuation:\ntypically display characteristic features such as ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and interstitial patterns, which are difficult to distinguish from other lung diseases. To address this challenge, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the images as either COVID-19 positive or negative. Our model is trained using a combination of transfer learning and fine-tuning, allowing it to learn from the pre-trained weights and adapt to the specific characteristics of the COVID-19 dataset. We evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and compare it to other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our model achieves a high level of accuracy and robustness, outperforming other methods in detecting COVID-19 patients from chest radiography images. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models in aiding the diagnosis of COVID-19, and highlights the importance of developing accurate and reliable diagnostic tools to combat this global health crisis.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease\n\nText continuation:\npresence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% ($\\pm$ 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates.

The Stream API introduces two key abstractions. The stream, which is a sequence of elements available in a data source, and the stream pipeline, which contains operations (e.g., map, filter, reduce) that are applied to the elements in the stream upon execution. Streams are getting popular among Java developers as they leverage the conciseness of functional programming and ease the parallelization of data processing. Despite the benefits of streams, in comparison to data processing relying on imperative code, streams can introduce significant overheads which are mainly caused by extra object allocations and reclamations, and\n\nText continuation:\nalso, the creation of intermediate streams and the evaluation of the stream operations can lead to increased memory usage.\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you need to process a large dataset and apply multiple operations to it. In imperative programming, you would typically use loops and conditional statements to achieve this. However, with streams, you can define a pipeline of operations that are applied to the dataset in a declarative manner. This can lead to more concise and readable code, but it can also lead to increased memory usage and object creation.\nTo mitigate these overheads, it's essential to understand the characteristics of your data and the operations you're applying to it. For example, if you're working with a large dataset and you're applying multiple filtering operations, you may want to consider using parallel streams to take advantage of multi-core processors and improve performance.\nAnother important consideration is the use of lazy evaluation in streams. By default, streams are lazily evaluated, which means that operations are only executed when the stream is actually consumed. This can lead to improved performance and reduced memory usage, as only the necessary data is processed. However, it can also lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful, as the stream pipeline may not be executed as expected.\nIn addition to these considerations, it's also important to be mindful of the type of operations you're applying to your streams. For example, if you're using a map operation to transform your data, you may want to consider using a parallel map operation to take advantage of multi-core processors and improve performance.\nIn conclusion, while streams can introduce significant overheads, they also offer many benefits in terms of conciseness, readability, and parallelization. By understanding the characteristics of your data and the operations you're applying to it, you can effectively use streams to improve the performance and efficiency of your Java applications.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

As a result, developers need means to study the runtime behavior of streams in the goal of both mitigating such abstraction overheads and optimizing stream processing. Unfortunately, there is a lack of dedicated tools able to dynamically analyze streams to help developers specifically locate issues degrading application performance. In this paper, we address the profiling and optimization of streams. We present a novel profiling technique for measuring the computations performed by a stream in terms of elapsed reference cycles, which we use to locate problematic streams with a major impact on application performance. While accuracy is crucial to this end, the inserted instrumentation code causes the execution of extra cycles, which are partially included in the profiles. To mitigate this issue, we estimate and compensate for the extra cycles caused by the inserted instrumentation code. We implement our approach in StreamProf that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first dedicated stream profiler for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). With StreamProf, we find that cycle profiling is effective to detect problematic streams whose optimization can enable significant performance gains. We also find that the accurate profiling of tasks supporting parallel stream processing allows the diagnosis of load imbalance according to the distribution of stream-related cycles at a thread level. We conduct an evaluation on sequential and parallel stream-based workloads that are publicly available in three different sources. The evaluation shows that our profiling technique is efficient and yields accurate profiles. Moreover, we show the actionability of our profiles by guiding stream-related optimizations on two workloads from Renaissance. Our optimizations require the modification of only a few lines of code while achieving speedups up to a factor of 5x. Java streams have been extensively studied by recent work, focusing on both how developers are using streams and how to optimize them. Current approaches in the optimization of streams mainly rely on static analysis techniques that overlook runtime information, suffer from important limitations to detect all streams executed by a Java application, or are not suitable for the analysis of parallel streams. Understanding the dynamic behavior of both sequential and parallel stream processing and its impact on application performance is crucial to help users make better decisions while using streams.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

For instance, the use of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology has been shown to provide highly accurate topographic data, even in complex urban environments. Additionally, the integration of multiple data sources, such as aerial imagery and ground-based sensors, can help to reduce errors and improve the overall accuracy of DEMs.\nFurthermore, the development of advanced computational methods and algorithms has enabled the creation of more sophisticated flood models that can better account for the complexities of overland flow and the influence of above-ground elements. These models can be used to simulate a wide range of flood scenarios, from small-scale flash floods to large-scale riverine floods, and can provide valuable insights into the behavior of floodwaters and the potential impacts of different flood mitigation strategies.\nDespite these advances, there is still much work to be done to fully understand the complexities of flood modeling and to develop more accurate and reliable flood risk assessments. Ongoing research is focused on addressing the challenges of DEM generation and refinement, as well as the development of more advanced computational methods and algorithms for flood modeling. By continuing to push the boundaries of what is possible with aerial photogrammetry and other technologies, researchers and practitioners can work together to improve our understanding of flood risk and to develop more effective strategies for mitigating the impacts of flood events.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The purpose of this study is to investigate uncertainties related to (i) the own error of high resolution topographic data, and (ii) the modeller choices when including topographic data in hydraulic codes. The aim is to perform a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) which goes through a Monte-Carlo uncertainty propagation, to quantify impact of uncertainties, followed by a Sobol' indices computation, to rank influence of identified parameters on result variability. A process using a coupling of an environment for parametric computation (Prom{\\'e}th{\\'e}e) and a code relying on 2D shallow water equations (FullSWOF 2D) has been developed (P-FS tool). The study has been performed over the lower part of the Var river valley using the estimated hydrograph of 1994 flood event. HR topographic data has been made available for the study area, which is 17.5 km 2 , by Nice municipality. Three uncertain parameters were studied: the measurement error (var.

Today, to balance various trade-offs, ML-based analytics tends to increasingly leverage an interconnected ecosystem that allows complex applications to be executed on hybrid infrastructures where IoT Edge devices are interconnected to Cloud/HPC systems in what is called the Computing Continuum, the Digital Continuum, or the Transcontinuum.Enabling learning-based analytics on\n\nText continuation:\nthese hybrid infrastructures requires advanced data processing and management capabilities, as well as robust security and networking solutions. This necessitates the development of new software frameworks and tools that can efficiently handle the complexities of distributed data processing, data fusion, and data analytics.\nOne such approach is the use of containerization and orchestration technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, to manage the deployment and scaling of ML workloads across hybrid infrastructures. These technologies enable the creation of portable, self-contained environments for ML applications, allowing them to be easily deployed and managed across different environments. Additionally, the use of cloud-native technologies, such as serverless computing and cloud-based data lakes, can provide scalable and cost-effective data processing and storage capabilities.\nAnother key aspect of enabling learning-based analytics on hybrid infrastructures is the development of advanced data processing and management capabilities. This includes the use of data streaming technologies, such as Apache Kafka and Apache Flink, to handle real-time data processing and analytics. Additionally, the use of distributed data processing frameworks, such as Apache Spark and Hadoop, can provide scalable and fault-tolerant data processing capabilities.\nFurthermore, the development of robust security and networking solutions is crucial for ensuring the secure processing and transmission of sensitive data across hybrid infrastructures. This includes the use of encryption technologies, such as SSL/TLS and AES, to protect data in transit and at rest. Additionally, the use of access control and authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth and Kerberos, can provide secure access to data and applications.\nIn conclusion, enabling learning-based analytics on hybrid infrastructures requires the development of advanced data processing and management capabilities, as well as robust security and networking solutions. By leveraging containerization and orchestration technologies, cloud-native technologies, data streaming technologies, distributed data processing frameworks, and robust security and networking solutions, organizations can create scalable, secure, and efficient hybrid infrastructures for ML-based analytics.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "*"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Add elbow conditioning and/or balance practice if your goals involve advanced calisthenics, but for simple strength/size it really is all you need.\nColoredMarxers: I would even go as far to possibly add some parallel bar or ring support work if he was up for it. Maybe even bar deadhangs for grip strength. It would be fun to integrate a little twist into a workout that could possibly get a bit tedious with time.\nbipocni: 100 dips &amp; pullups gets tedious like hill sprints get tedious.  It's hard, and it sucks, but you won't exactly get *bored*.\nDwas hangs and support work aren't strictly speaking necessary, but they could be fun.  There's also the capacity to do different *kinds* of pullups, like chins, mixed grip, neutral, offset, towel grip, ect.  Dips could at least be moved up to Russian dips occasionally.  There's definitely room for play, as long as the spirit of the thing is kept intact.\nColoredMarxers: 100% agree.

(la) So, relative to what I know, it is rational of me to believe S. (2) Now that I have more evidence, S may no longer be probable. (2a) So now, relative to what I know, it is not rational of me to believe S. These seem a perfectly ordinary, common sense, pair of situations. Generally and vaguely, I take them to embody what I shall call probabilistic inference. This form of inference is clearly non-monotonic. Relatively few people have taken this form of inference, based on high probability, to serve as a foundation for non-monotonic logic or for a logical or defeasible inference. There are exceptions: Jane Nutter [16] thinks that sometimes probability has something to do with non-monotonic reasoning. Judea Pearl [ 17] has recently\n\nText continuation:\nargued that probabilistic inference can be used to model defeasible reasoning, and has proposed a formal system for doing so. This is an important contribution, as it shows that probabilistic inference can be used to reason about uncertain information in a way that is both logically sound and computationally tractable.\nIn addition to these exceptions, there are also some researchers who have explored the connection between probabilistic inference and non-monotonic logic more broadly. For example, [18] has shown that probabilistic inference can be used to model non-monotonic reasoning in the context of default logic, while [19] has used probabilistic inference to model non-monotonic reasoning in the context of circumscription. These results suggest that probabilistic inference may be a useful tool for reasoning about uncertain information in a wide range of contexts, and may be particularly useful in situations where the evidence is incomplete or uncertain.\nOne of the key challenges in using probabilistic inference to reason about uncertain information is dealing with the problem of uncertainty itself. In many cases, the evidence is incomplete or uncertain, and it is difficult to determine the probability of a given event or proposition. This is known as the problem of \"uncertainty propagation,\" and it is a major challenge in many areas of artificial intelligence and decision theory. However, there are also many researchers who are working on developing new methods and techniques for dealing with uncertainty, and who are exploring the potential applications of probabilistic inference in a wide range of fields.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "One", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

(la) So, relative to what I know, it is rational of me to believe S. (2) Now that I have more evidence, S may no longer be probable. (2a) So now, relative to what I know, it is not rational of me to believe S. These seem a perfectly ordinary, common sense, pair of situations. Generally and vaguely, I take them to embody what I shall call probabilistic inference. This form of inference is clearly non-monotonic. Relatively few people have taken this form of inference, based on high probability, to serve as a foundation for non-monotonic logic or for a logical or defeasible inference. There are exceptions: Jane Nutter [16] thinks that sometimes probability has something to do with non-monotonic reasoning. Judea Pearl [ 17] has recently\n\nText continuation:\nbeen exploring the possibility. There are any number of people whom one might call probability enthusiasts who feel that probability provides all the answers by itself, with no need of help from logic. Cheeseman [1], Henrion [5] and others think it useful to look at a distribution of probabilities over a whole algebra of statements, to update that distribution in the light of new evidence, and to use the latest updated distribution of probability over the algebra as a basis for planning and decision making. A slightly weaker form of this approach is captured by Nilsson [15], where one assumes certain probabilities for certain statements, and infers the probabilities, or constraints on the probabilities of other statement. None of this corresponds to what I call probabilistic inference. All of the inference that is taking place, either in Bayesian updating, or in probabilistic logic, is strictly deductive. Deductive inference, particularly that concerned with the distribution of classical probabilities or chances, is of great importance. But this is not to say that there is no important role for what earlier logicians have called \"ampliative\" or \"inductive\" or \"scientific\" inference, in which the conclusion goes beyond the premises, asserts more than do the premises. This depends on what David Israel [6] has called \"real rules of inference\". It is characteristic of any such logic or inference procedure that it can go wrong: that statements accepted at one point may be rejected at a later point.

He was particularly known for his expertise in the treatment of shell shock, a condition that was poorly understood at the time. Despite the challenges of wartime medicine, Wallace continued to develop his skills and reputation, and was eventually awarded the OBE for his services.\nAfter the war, Wallace returned to London and resumed his position as surgeon at St Thomas's Hospital. He continued to work at the hospital for many years, becoming a respected figure in the medical community. In 1931, he was created a baronet, and he was also a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. Wallace was known for his kind and compassionate nature, and was beloved by his patients and colleagues alike. He retired from active practice in the late 1930s, but continued to work as a consultant until his death in 1944. Throughout his long and distinguished career, Wallace was a true pioneer in the field of surgery, and his legacy continues to inspire and influence medical professionals to this day.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "*"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The State would then be the guarantor in order to facilitate their access to financing, also reduced by Basel III and Solvency II. This policy develops a system of reallocation of financing capacities from non-virtuous companies to the most virtuous ones with public guarantees, aiming to reduce the debt ratio while increasing green investments, with monetary policies of rates but also of volumes and ratios differentiated according to the types of assets and the greening of bank balance sheets, and finally forms of public-private partnership. Facilitating the financing of green companies would green capital but increase it, partly neutralising the positive environmental impact. It is therefore necessary to limit the credit expansion of ''brown'' companies. This would reduce risky operations and favour less leveraged investments more connected to the real economy, reducing systemic financial risk. -- The Agenda 2030 Policy Briefs series (PoCFiN Kedge Business School - SDSN France - Institut Rousseau) mobilises economists and practitioners to identify an agenda of economic and financial reforms to achieve the 2030 Agenda, at territorial, national and supranational levels.

Others might call him crazy. I-Reporter Joshua Hanson offered a look at the Mark IV helmet from his \"Legendary Limited Edition Halo 3.\" Hanson waited more than eight hours outside a Woodbury, Minnesota, video game store on Monday evening to be the first in his town to buy one of the most anticipated video games in history -- \"Halo 3.\"  Watch Hanson buying the game amid cheers \u00bb . The final chapter in Microsoft's acclaimed video game series hit shelves at the stroke of midnight Monday in similar stores across the nation. The Xbox 360 game is expected to shatter entertainment sales records within its first 24 hours of release. Hanson is not alone in his loyalty to the game, and his belief in \"Halo's\" power to entertain and inspire. We asked other CNN.com readers for their take on \"Halo 3.\" Some offered comparisons to \"Star Wars\" and \"Harry Potter,\" while others discussed compelling new graphics and features. Below is a selection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Curt Otto of Springfield, Virginia I waited in line for two-and-half hours to get this game at midnight. I purchased the Legendary Edition of this game at a hefty $130! Totally worth it! Although I haven't slept since yesterday and I'm currently at work and very tired, I would do it all over again for \"Halo.\" This is the GREATEST game ever crafted by the hand of man. If you own a 360, buy this game. If you don't own a 360, buy one and go buy this game! The single player is incredible and the online multiplayer is MIND BLOWING! Totally worth $130!!! Tony Nash of Buffalo, New York  I've been playing \"Halo\" since the very first game came out in 2001. After getting the brand new Box with a copy of \"Halo\" and throwing myself into the game, I quickly realized this wasn't a standard gaming experience. It was something much, much more. The game had a great attitude and unique art style. Along with great audio and environments that brought the worlds to life. It also had the most addictive, natural, and fun game play I've ever experienced. It also contained a well written, downright intriguing story. Getting together with friends to play the multiplayer portion of the game only cemented this title's epic status. Then came November 2004, when, of course, a friend and I were in the lines for the Midnight release of \"Halo 2.\" It is no joke; \"Halo\" is more than just a game. Now, I plan on \"finishing the fight\" as soon as I leave work. I had \"Halo 3\" pre-ordered for about a month before it came out. Hey, after all, it's good to keep the kid inside you alive and well! Cody Chmelik of Clearwater, Florida  \"Halo 3\" is the most anticipated event since the trial of O.J., but the only difference is that \"Halo\" isn't disappointing. \"Halo 3\" was the best game I have ever played. The levels are choreographed perfectly, the players look real and the game play is phenomenal. I recommend this game to players of all ages. Wayne S. of Colorado Springs, Colorado  \"Halo\" is not just a game, it's a lifestyle, a booming culture of millions of Xbox fans who eat, sleep and live \"Halo.\" \"Halo\" has jumped started the major league gaming industry and will continue to do so with \"Halo 3.\" I will be getting my copy of \"Halo 3\" at midnight and plan on playing it for days straight. I have played the beta and let me tell you: This is the best video game of the year by far and will be played by the masses for years to come just like \"Halo 2.\" Brian Baker of Beatrice, Nebraska I am 30 years old, and for my 30th birthday my wife pre-ordered \"Halo 3\" for me as a birthday present. The 6 month wait for the present/game didn't bother me one bit. The story that is \"Halo\" is something that people can easily identify with. The late '70s to late '90s had Luke Skywalker and the alpha-male heroes of \"Star Wars.\" The Generation X, Y and Z now have an alpha-male hero of their own in the Master Chief that they can relate to, or use to associate different attitudes and help instill values of patriotism. In this case, patriotism is not for just a country, but an entire planet and species.

Others might call him crazy. I-Reporter Joshua Hanson offered a look at the Mark IV helmet from his \"Legendary Limited Edition Halo 3.\" Hanson waited more than eight hours outside a Woodbury, Minnesota, video game store on Monday evening to be the first in his town to buy one of the most anticipated video games in history -- \"Halo 3.\"  Watch Hanson buying the game amid cheers \u00bb . The final chapter in Microsoft's acclaimed video game series hit shelves at the stroke of midnight Monday in similar stores across the nation. The Xbox 360 game is expected to shatter entertainment sales records within its first 24 hours of release. Hanson is not alone in his loyalty to the game, and his belief in \"Halo's\" power to entertain and inspire. We asked other CNN.com readers for their take on \"Halo 3.\" Some offered comparisons to \"Star Wars\" and \"Harry Potter,\" while others discussed compelling new graphics and features. Below is a selection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Curt Otto of Springfield, Virginia I waited in line for two-and-half hours to get this game at midnight. I purchased the Legendary Edition of this game at a hefty $130! Totally worth it! Although I haven't slept since yesterday and I'm currently at work and very tired, I would do it all over again for \"Halo.\" This is the GREATEST game ever crafted by the hand of man. If you own a 360, buy this game. If you don't own a 360, buy one and go buy this game! The single player is incredible and the online multiplayer is MIND BLOWING! Totally worth $130!!! Tony Nash of Buffalo, New York  I've been playing \"Halo\" since the very first game came out in 2001. After getting the brand new Box with a copy of \"Halo\" and throwing myself into the game, I quickly realized this wasn't a standard gaming experience. It was something much, much more. The game had a great attitude and unique art style. Along with great audio and environments that brought the worlds to life. It also had the most addictive, natural, and fun game play I've ever experienced. It also contained a well written, downright intriguing story. Getting together with friends to play the multiplayer portion of the game only cemented this title's epic status. Then came November 2004, when, of course, a friend and I were in the lines for the Midnight release of \"Halo 2.\" It is no joke; \"Halo\" is more than just a game. Now, I plan on \"finishing the fight\" as soon as I leave work. I had \"Halo 3\" pre-ordered for about a month before it came out. Hey, after all, it's good to keep the kid inside you alive and well! Cody Chmelik of Clearwater, Florida  \"Halo 3\" is the most anticipated event since the trial of O.J., but the only difference is that \"Halo\" isn't disappointing. \"Halo 3\" was the best game I have ever played. The levels are choreographed perfectly, the players look real and the game play is phenomenal. I recommend this game to players of all ages. Wayne S. of Colorado Springs, Colorado  \"Halo\" is not just a game, it's a lifestyle, a booming culture of millions of Xbox fans who eat, sleep and live \"Halo.\" \"Halo\" has jumped started the major league gaming industry and will continue to do so with \"Halo 3.\" I will be getting my copy of \"Halo 3\" at midnight and plan on playing it for days straight. I have played the beta and let me tell you: This is the best video game of the year by far and will be played by the masses for years to come just like \"Halo 2.\" Brian Baker of Beatrice, Nebraska I am 30 years old, and for my 30th birthday my wife pre-ordered \"Halo 3\" for me as a birthday present. The 6 month wait for the present/game didn't bother me one bit. The story that is \"Halo\" is something that people can easily identify with. The late '70s to late '90s had Luke Skywalker and the alpha-male heroes of \"Star Wars.\" The Generation X, Y and Z now have an alpha-male hero of their own in the Master Chief that they can relate to, or use to associate different attitudes and help instill values of patriotism. In this case, patriotism is not for just a country, but an entire planet and species. I am a very patriotic person, a veteran and a father and see the values that may hide below the surface in this Trilogy, which is why I'm a \"Halo\" fan.

CMV\nI think I can sort of understand economic issues with how marriage laws work in relation to benefits and taxes -- in these cases I could see polygamy as a clever method of tax evasion or something of the sort. Also, I see that it is morally wrong when, say, one partner is not aware that there is a third partner in a certain marriage/relationship. But personally, I see nothing morally or ethically wrong with polygamy if it is between clearly consenting adults. CMV! :)\nFallingSnowAngel: Are we talking about polygamy in an ideal world, as an abstract, or polygamy in a world where wealthy men frequently compete to accumulate as many beautiful wives as possible, replacing them as needed, while their sons are treated\n\nText continuation:\nlike disposable property?\nAlienArchitect: Ah, I see what you're getting at. You're highlighting the potential for exploitation and power imbalances in a polygamous system. And I agree, those are definitely concerns that need to be addressed. But I still don't think that's a reason to dismiss the concept of polygamy entirely.\nFallingSnowAngel: But isn't that the problem? We're so quick to dismiss the potential for harm and exploitation, and instead focus on the theoretical benefits of polygamy, without considering the very real-world implications. And what about the women in these situations? Are they truly consenting, or are they being coerced or manipulated into these relationships?\nAlienArchitect: That's a fair point, and I think it's important to acknowledge that power imbalances can and do occur in any relationship, not just polygamous ones. But I still think that with proper laws and regulations in place, polygamy could be a viable option for some people. And what about the women who do choose to be in polygamous relationships? Shouldn't their agency and autonomy be respected?\nFallingSnowAngel: I'm not saying that women in polygamous relationships don't have agency or autonomy. But I am saying that we need to be critical of the systems and structures that enable and perpetuate these relationships. And what about the children who are born into these families? How do they fare in a system where there is no clear parental authority or responsibility?\nAlienArchitect: That's a great point, and I think it's something that needs to be addressed. But I still think that with the right support systems and resources in place, polygamous families could thrive. And what about the benefits of polygamy? Don't we need to consider the potential advantages of having multiple caregivers and role models in a child's life?\nFallingSnowAngel: I see what you're saying, but I'm not convinced that the benefits of polygamy outweigh the potential drawbacks. And what about the societal implications? Don't we need to consider how polygamy would affect our social norms and institutions? Would it lead to a more equitable and just society, or would it exacerbate existing power imbalances and inequalities?\nAlienArchitect: I think that's a great question, and one that needs to be explored. But I still think that polygamy, or at least the idea of it, is worth considering. And who knows, maybe in the future, we'll have a more nuanced understanding of what polygamy could look like in practice. Maybe we'll have a society where polygamy is seen as a viable and healthy option for some people, and not just a relic of the past or a tool for exploitation.\nFallingSnowAngel: I suppose we'll just have to wait and see. But in the meantime, I think it's important for us to keep having these conversations and critically examining the implications of polygamy. Maybe we'll come up with some innovative solutions that address the concerns you've raised, and create a more equitable and just society for all.\nAs we continue to discuss and debate the topic of polygamy, it's clear that there are many complex and nuanced issues at play. While some people may see polygamy as a viable option for some individuals, others may view it as a system that perpetuates power imbalances and exploitation. Ultimately, the decision to enter into a polygamous relationship should be a personal one, made with full knowledge of the potential consequences and implications.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Surely they'd still have loving mothers even if their father was busy with business or a bunch of other children? But then there exist traditionally married families with children in the double figures or uncaring, work-driven fathers so this isn't the fault of polygamy. \nI really don't see how anything you've said is worse than the current state of marriage in which wealthy men have wives and several mistresses. Any why is that morally wrong anyway? The women live in splendor and the man gets his sexy time. They're all consenting adults here.\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: One man having 20 wives creates a surplus of male children that must be driven off to preserve the status quo, this is how polygamy is practiced in the real world. \nimjusthereforkitties: Contraception?\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: How would contraception help? They want numerous children, they don't want men to compete for wives with. \nimjusthereforkitties: Oh i thought the kids would be accidents if they were being driven away upon maturation. Well that sucks, though i still think polygamy would go down differently in western culture...but i guess this is what FallingSnowAngel said about polygamy's difference as an abstract and an ideal.\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: Polygamy is in like this in America in fundamentalist morman communities, that might not be the West you were thinking of but it's hard to think of a religion more American. The problem with polygamy is that it can't be a relationship between equals. The man makes the decisions and the women have to live with it. I don't have a problem with polyamory, but a system where a man can have an unlimited number of wives to use and control does seem morally and ethically suspect. If people have freedom to choose, education, opportunities it doesn't seem like a relationship that is based on women being property would organically arise. While monogamy has it's roots in property exchange, we have dating today, marriage is based on friendship, love, affection, commitment regardless of gender and not the economic and political institution it was originally created to be. Egalitarian group marriage is a whole nother can of worms, nothing wrong with having a poly family and it obviously works for some but I can't begin to imagine how to address the issue legislatively. If marriage is about love and building a life and creating a family (not necessarily children) then we should be able to find a way, but we certainly haven't gotten there yet.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Not", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

These processes describe the evolution of a system of Brownian particles moving on the real line with piecewise constant drifts, and are the natural generalization of the rank-based diffusion processes introduced in stochastic portfolio theory or in the probabilistic interpretation of nonlinear evolution equations. Owing to the discontinuity of the drift coefficient, the corresponding ordinary differential equations are ill-posed. Therefore, the small noise limit of order-based diffusion processes is not covered by the classical Freidlin-Wentzell\n\nText continuation:\ntheory, which relies heavily on the smoothness of the drift coefficient.\nIn this context, the theory of order-based diffusion processes is particularly challenging, as it requires the development of new mathematical tools and techniques to handle the discontinuity of the drift coefficient. The key idea is to exploit the ordering structure of the process to construct a new probability measure, which is then used to define the solution to the stochastic differential equation. This approach allows us to bypass the difficulties associated with the ill-posedness of the ordinary differential equation and to establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the stochastic differential equation.\nOne of the main advantages of order-based diffusion processes is that they can be used to model complex systems with multiple interacting components, where the interactions are not necessarily smooth or continuous. For example, in the context of finance, order-based diffusion processes can be used to model the behavior of a portfolio of assets, where the drift of each asset is influenced by the ordering of the assets in the portfolio. This can be particularly useful in modeling the behavior of complex financial systems, where the interactions between different assets can be highly nonlinear and discontinuous.\nAnother important application of order-based diffusion processes is in the context of biology, where they can be used to model the behavior of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks or protein-protein interaction networks. In these systems, the interactions between different components can be highly nonlinear and discontinuous, and order-based diffusion processes can be used to model the behavior of these systems in a more realistic and accurate way.\nIn conclusion, order-based diffusion processes are a powerful tool for modeling complex systems with multiple interacting components, where the interactions are not necessarily smooth or continuous. They offer a new perspective on the behavior of these systems and can be used to model complex phenomena that are difficult or impossible to capture using traditional methods.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

These processes describe the evolution of a system of Brownian particles moving on the real line with piecewise constant drifts, and are the natural generalization of the rank-based diffusion processes introduced in stochastic portfolio theory or in the probabilistic interpretation of nonlinear evolution equations. Owing to the discontinuity of the drift coefficient, the corresponding ordinary differential equations are ill-posed. Therefore, the small noise limit of order-based diffusion processes is not covered by the classical Freidlin-Wentzell\n\nText continuation:\ntheory. The description of this limit is the purpose of this article. We first give a complete analysis of the two-particle case. Despite its apparent simplicity, the small noise limit of such a system already exhibits various behaviours. In particular, depending on the drift coefficient, the particles can either stick into a cluster, the velocity of which is determined by elementary computations, or drift away from each other at constant velocity, in a random ordering. The persistence of randomness in the zero noise limit is of the very same nature as in the pioneering works by Veretennikov (Mat. Zametki, 1983) and Bafico and Baldi (Stochastics, 1981) concerning the so-called Peano phenomenon. In the case of rank-based processes, we use a simple convexity argument to prove that the small noise limit is described by the sticky particle dynamics introduced by Brenier and Grenier (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 1998), where particles travel at constant velocity between collisions, at which they stick together. In the general case of order-based processes, we give a sufficient condition on the drift for all the particles to aggregate into a single cluster, and compute the velocity of this cluster. Our argument consists in turning the study of the small noise limit into the study of the long time behaviour of a suitably rescaled process, and then exhibiting a Lyapunov functional for this rescaled process.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Additionally, temperature, and thus cooking, can be very even throughout the food in sous vide cooking, even with irregularly shaped and very thick items, given enough time.\n\nSummary:\nBy contrast, in conventional high-heat cooking, such as oven roasting or grilling, the food is exposed to heat levels that are much higher than the desired internal cooking temperature, and it must be removed from the high heat prior to reaching the desired cooking temperature. If the food is removed from the heat too late, it becomes overcooked, and if it is removed too early, it is undercooked.\nThe use of temperatures much lower than those used for conventional cooking is an essential feature of sous vide. When cooking meat, tough collagen in connective tissue can be denatured into gelatin, without heating the meat's proteins high enough that they denature to a degree that the texture toughens and moisture is exuded from the meat.\nIn contrast, soft vegetables are often considered overcooked. Low-temperature cooking allows plant matter to remain more succulent, as the cell walls do not burst. Cooking vegetables at temperatures below the boiling point of water allows them to be thoroughly cooked (and pasteurized, if necessary) while maintaining a firm or somewhat crisp texture. While the cell walls will generally not burst, the depolymerization of the pectic polysaccharides that connect the vegetable cells together and the gelatinisation of starch in the vegetable can be achieved without overcooking.\nFrom a culinary viewpoint, the exclusion of air is secondary, but this has practical importance. It allows cooked food to be stored, still sealed and refrigerated, for considerable times, which is especially useful for the catering industry, and it excludes oxygen from food that requires long cooking and is susceptible to oxidation, e.g., fat on meat, which may become rancid with prolonged exposure to air.

Ex: /u/&lt;username&gt;.\n/u/vaughannt asked: \n&gt;I'm trying to work up to the arch hold. Currently just doing the leg lift portion for 30 seconds. Should I be feeling muscle activation in my core? It seems like I only feel it in my legs. I was feeling it in my lower back momentarily but I think I've corrected that. Anyone have tips?\nstickysweetastytreat: u/vaughannt\nYeah feeling it in your legs is fine, like along your butt &amp; backs of your thighs. For low back, there are two ways you can do it-- by moving your low back with it, or not. If you want to keep it out of your low back, then tuck your tailbone while you lift your legs solely with your butt + legs. Don't expect to lift your legs very high this way, but you do put more work on your butt/legs. Instead of thinking \"tuck your tailbone\", you could also think of it like trying to draw your navel up away from the floor while you lift your legs.\nIf your low back isn't irritated by it, there's no inherent harm in moving with your low back. You could even try both ways!\nvaughannt: Awesome, thank you for the reply!\nstickysweetastytreat: Yw, good luck!\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "*"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "*"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Rev. D 80, 024015, arxiv:0808.3484) that the equation of state (ES) of extremely hot Fermi-Dirac gas in the surface layer of an ultra-relativistic compact object converges to the same form as the relativistic equation of thermodynamical equilibrium (RETE), which is the condition of stability of the object. The description of energy state of a gas particle was completed with the term corresponding with the potential-type energy. The necessity of such the term is set by the demand of convergence of the relativistic particle-impulse distribution law to its Maxwell-Boltzmann form in the classical limit. The identity of the ES and RETE, both applied to the gas in the object's surface layer, becomes\n\nText continuation:\nmore evident when considering the implications of this convergence on the behavior of the gas in the vicinity of the event horizon. In particular, the study reveals that the Fermi-Dirac gas exhibits a unique property, known as \"quantum smearing,\" which arises from the interplay between the quantum nature of the gas and the strong gravitational field of the compact object. This smearing effect leads to a modification of the equation of state, which in turn affects the stability of the object. The investigation also highlights the importance of considering the effects of quantum statistics on the behavior of the gas in the surface layer, as these effects can significantly impact the overall stability of the compact object. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the relativistic equation of thermodynamical equilibrium can be used as a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of extreme astrophysical systems, such as black holes and neutron stars.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "*"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In this state, the internal energy of gas particles in a volume of the object's surface layer increases over all limits in the frame of the volume and this opens the question if the horizon of events actually is an insuperable barrier. It seems to be possible that some matter can be temporarily lifted above the surface or, so far, be ejected from the object and can emit a radiation detectable by a distant observer. In our contribution, we demonstrate a general validity of the functional form of the potential-type energy found in our previous work. The consistency of the RETE with its non-relativistic approximation can occur only for this functional form. We also point out some observational consequences of the approximate identity of ES and RETE before the object collapses, in the proper time, to its gravitational radius as well as the possible observational consequences of the infinitely high internal energy in the surface layer of already collapsed object. In general, we propagate the idea that a lot of phenomena observed at the stellar-sized or supermassive black holes (or not-yet black holes) can be not necessarily related to the structures in a vicinity of the black hole, e.g. to an accretion disk, but they can be linked directly to the behaviour of the central, ultra-compact object.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

This will give you a good idea of what the car is worth on the open market. Keep in mind that the dealer payoff amount is the amount the finance company is willing to pay to take the car back, but the trade-in appraisal will be the amount the dealer is willing to give you for the car. \nWhen you get the trade-in appraisal, take it to the finance company and ask them to match the dealer's offer. This is where you can potentially get a good deal. If the dealer is willing to give you X amount for the car, and the finance company is willing to pay Y amount to take the car back, you can try to negotiate a deal where the finance company pays the higher amount (Y) and you walk away with the difference. \nIt's also worth noting that some dealerships may be willing to give you a better deal than others, so don't be afraid to shop around.

I have seen people return their lease and miss out out on nearly $10K because they didn\u2019t know they had the option to SELL their lease vehicle.\nSource: Car business\nFeel free to DM me with questions. Edit: I will do my best to help everyone I can but I am very busy at work right now and I have had at least 15 messages sent to me so far\nIMPORTANT EDIT: *You* do not have to buy out your lease first to sell your car. When you sell the car to the dealer just mention to them that there is a payoff on the vehicle still and they will get the necessary info to pay the lease off on YOUR behalf just like they would if you traded a car with a payoff still on it.\nJoethemofoe: Why would it matter how much it's worth if you signed a lease for 2 years? Isn't it just turn it back in when your done?\nLinkedPioneer: Sure, you can just turn the lease in when the lease ends. \nThat\u2019s beneficial to you if you have *negative equity* because you can just hand them the keys and walk away without paying a cent (unless you\u2019re over on miles and have to pay a mileage penalty.) \nBut if the car is worth *more* than the payoff amount you\u2019d be a fool to turn it in instead of selling it to a dealer.\nJoethemofoe: I guess I'm not understanding how a lease works\nLinkedPioneer: When a lease ends you typically have four options;\n1.) Turn in the car to a dealer and walk away\n2.) Buy out the lease\n3.) Trade it in towards a new vehicle\n4.) (If the car is worth MORE than what the lease payoff amount is) you can SELL the car to a dealer and get a check back for the equity!\nJoethemofoe: Your assuming they won't charge you makert value either\nCharmingTuber: No, that's the piece you're missing. The buyout price is set when you sign the lease. They know how cars depreciate, so it's all set in stone in your lease agreement.\nBut that was set two+years ago when the car market wasn't upsidedown. Now, you can buy it off at that original depreciation and sell it back at the current market rate.\nJoethemofoe: I get it now. I've never leased before only bought\nCharmingTuber: It's cool.

One thing that really stuck out to me is that most restrooms here don't have paper towels or an electric hand dryer.  I didn't really know what to think, and I spent the first few weeks drying my hands on my hair, (killing two birds with one stone by conveniently styling it at the same time, haha) or on my pants.  Then I happened to be in the bathroom at the same time as one of my coworkers and I had to wait while he washed his hands before me.  Lo and behold, he pulls a handkerchief out of his pocket and dries his hands before leaving...  I was speechless!  Such a simple solution that solves many problems and is\n\nText continuation:\nnot only eco-friendly but also practical.\nI couldn't help but wonder why we don't use handkerchiefs more often in the West.  I mean, it's not like we don't have them, but for some reason, we've become so accustomed to using paper towels and electric hand dryers that it seems like a foreign concept to carry a small piece of cloth around with us.  And yet, it's so effective!  No more wasting paper, no more energy consumption, no more awkward moments when you're trying to dry your hands in a public restroom.  It's a win-win situation!\nAs I continued to observe my coworkers and the locals, I noticed that they all carried handkerchiefs with them, not just for drying their hands but also for wiping their noses, cleaning their faces, and even as a makeshift bandage if needed.  It was amazing to see how versatile and resourceful they were with such a simple tool.  And it got me thinking, why can't we do the same?  Why can't we adopt this simple yet effective habit and make a positive impact on our environment?\nI started carrying a handkerchief with me and I have to say, it's been a game-changer.  I no longer worry about running out of paper towels or having to search for a public restroom with an electric hand dryer.  I just carry my trusty handkerchief and I'm good to go.  And the best part is, it's not just about the environment; it's also about being more mindful and present in the moment.  When you're carrying a handkerchief, you're more aware of your surroundings, more aware of your body and your needs, and more aware of the simple pleasures in life.\nI know it may seem like a small change, but trust me, it's a big deal.  It's a small step towards a more sustainable future, a more mindful present, and a more resourceful you.  So, next time you're in a public restroom and you're tempted to reach for the paper towels, remember the handkerchief and the simple yet effective solution it provides.  You never know, you might just start a revolution!\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "So", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Such a simple solution that solves many problems and is\n\nText continuation:\nenvironmentally friendly as well.  Think about how many rolls of paper towel are used in every US bathroom every year...  Long story short - carry a handkerchief to dry your hands instead of using paper towels.  Other benefits include:  wiping your brow while performing stressful tasks, use as a pocket square in a pinch (if it looks nice and isn't too dirty), or blowing your nose when absolutely necessary.\nClintHammer: How is that environmentally friendly?  Paper is a farmed product.  The trees they grow for paper are grown for paper.  If you reduce demand for paper, you reduce the number of trees.\nThe only reason people say paper is bad for the environment is because to make the nice white paper that people like to print things on, the pulp has to be thoroughly treated with chemicals.  Brown men's room towels don't.  \nAlso your \"lifehack\" is carry a handkercheif?  That's not what a lifehack is, you dope.  That's a \"thing I like to do\" \nsupersasuke: I get your point about paper being a farmed product and that cutting down on using tons of it in bathrooms might not technically be any better for the environment, however, I was merely pointing out a very simple (maybe obvious) use of a handkerchief that anyone can choose to start implementing.  I also want to point out that cutting down on the amount of paper towels used will reduce the amount of plastic trash bags used in bathrooms as well, because without the trash constantly filling up, there is less of a need to empty it regularly.  My observation was simply that I never see people in the US carrying or using handkerchiefs, and it seems to be a staple EDC item in India.  I'm sorry if I offended your definition of a \"lifehack\", I just wanted to point out a difference in culture that I noticed that may appeal to certain people who don't find satisfaction in wiping their hands on paper towels every time they visit a restroom...\nClintHammer: &gt; I was merely pointing out a very simple (maybe obvious) use of a handkerchief\n\nYeah, you suggested someone use something for its intended purpose. \nhttp://i.imgur.com/OFi6aaV.png \nsupersasuke: You got me.  I guess I thought it might be worth it because I don't see many people using them at all...  It's interesting how much of a different perspective I'm gaining just being in India for the last few weeks.

However, I do have a few suggestions to consider:\n* For strengthening your back, you may want to consider adding some exercises that target the latissimus dorsi muscles, such as pull-ups or assisted pull-ups. You're already doing chin-ups, which is a great start, but you may want to consider increasing the difficulty by adding weight or using a resistance band.\n* For your wrists and forearms, you're doing a good job with the grip exercises and fingertip planks. However, you may want to consider adding some exercises that target the forearm muscles, such as wrist curls or forearm extensions.\n* For handstand push-ups, you may want to consider adding some exercises that target the shoulder muscles, such as push-ups or shoulder press. You're already doing decline pike push-ups, which is a great exercise for building strength, but you may want to consider adding some variations to target different muscle groups.\nHere's an example of how you could modify your routine to incorporate some of these suggestions:\nOn Days (every 2nd day):\n* Warm-Up w. Wrist Warm-Up (10min)\n* 4x3 Chin-Ups (Building strength for Pull-Ups)\n* 3x4 Beginner Shrimp Squats\n* 3x8 Decline Pike Push-Ups\n* 3x8 Flat Straight Leg Raises\n* 3x15s Fingertip Planks (Weak wrists, building strength for Fingertip Push-Ups)\n* 3x30s Arched Hold\n* 3x45s Reverse Plank Bridge\n* 3x30s Hollow Body Hold\n* 3x10 Wrist Curls (Forearm strength)\n* 3x10 Forearm Extensions (Forearm strength)\n* 3x8 Pull-Ups (Building strength for Handstand Push-Ups)\n* 3x60s Weighed Plank\n* 10s [Yaad Lean](http://antranik.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/yaad-lean.jpg)\n* Cool-Down (6-7min)\nOff Days\nYou could also consider adding some active recovery exercises on your off days, such as light cardio or yoga, to help with recovery and prevent injury. Additionally, you may want to consider increasing the difficulty of your exercises over time by adding weight, increasing the number of reps, or decreasing rest time between sets.\nOverall, your routine is a great start, and with a few modifications, you can continue to make progress towards your goals.

But why stop there ? Is time a constraint ?\nYou can strengthen pretty much the whole body if you add in progressions for horizontal push(PPPUs) and pull (Tuck lever rows) to your current routine which already has vertical push, pull and legs. You might have to split up the days into push/pull days like in the recommend routine or into verical/horizontal days (my current routine) with rest days inbetween. \nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Train everything so that there are no weak links. The choice is upto you though :)\nihatepepperballs: Back and forearms/wrists are my biggest weakness right now, so that's what I'm focusing on.\nBy the way: how could I split this into two parts? I would like to do the first half in the morning, then the second one in the afternoon.\nThanks for the input :)\nn3ox1ne: Its a 2 day split. For example, Monday would be horizontal day with pushups/rows/core. Tuesday would be rest day and Wednesday would be vertical day with pullups/dips(will move to hspu after getting good stable handstands)/legs. Thursday would be rest and Friday would be horizontal again and it just repeats like that every day, rest, train, rest.\nThis is my personal routine modified from the recommend one. It makes sense to me and works for me. It might be different for you. Stick to the recommend routine for 2 or 3 months atleast and then make changes if needed. Good luck and enjoy this journey :D\nihatepepperballs: I feel like that's too much rest time, especially for a teenager. I want action, dammit :D\nAre you sure it would be more beneficial to split it into two days when I could do the whole thing in one?\nn3ox1ne: Your recovery time will have to increase especially after progressing to the intermediate movements. The tendons and joints will need more rest between sessions. Otherwise you will overtrain the body and get injured. Remember this is not a race. Take it slow and stay injury free.

AMC's \"Mad Men\" and FX's \"Damages\" made Emmy history Thursday as the first basic-cable series to be nominated for best drama. The pair, which had made the 10-series Emmy shortlist, have been widely hailed by critics and have received good ratings for basic-cable series -- though \"Damages\" star Glenn Close said she hopes the Emmys help boost the show's audience. \"We need all the help we can get,\" she told The Associated Press. On the other hand, HBO's \"The Wire\" -- which concluded its fifth and final season this year -- once again came up empty in the best drama nominations. It did receive one nod, for writing. The series, though much praised and dissected by a hard-core group of fans, has received little recognition from the Emmys, with just one previous nomination -- also for writing -- in 2005.  Check out some of the top Emmy nods this year \u00bb . Indeed, HBO has struggled to find a drama to take the place of the much-lauded \"The Sopranos,\" which won best drama last year after a storied run. \"Mad Men,\" which has made AMC into a player, was allegedly turned down by the cable giant, and shows such as the quickly canceled \"John From Cincinnati\" and \"Rome\" haven't had the same impact. On the other hand, \"In Treatment\" received a nomination for Gabriel Byrne's performance as a therapist, and the network's comedies, particularly \"Entourage,\" have performed strongly. Moreover, the network's short-form programming, such as the miniseries \"John Adams\" and the TV movie \"Recount,\" dominated their Emmy categories: \"John Adams\" led all nominees with 23 nominations, and \"Recount,\" about the 2000 presidential election battle, received 11. \"The network has made up for [its lack of drama series success] in other forms,\" Variety TV editor Michael Schneider told CNN. \"It's still the most nominated network and has the most nominated program.\" HBO led all networks with 85 nominations. Among broadcast networks, ABC led with 76 nominations. Among regularly scheduled TV series, \"30 Rock\" earned 17 nominations and \"Mad Men\" received 16. The 17 nominations for \"30 Rock\" were a record number in a single year for a comedy series. Newcomer \"Pushing Daisies,\" the whimsical series on ABC, received 12 nominations. Given that the show only aired nine episodes -- and hasn't been on the air in months due to the writers strike -- its recognition was a surprise, Schneider said. \"It was nice that voters still remembered it,\" he said. Along with \"Damages\" and \"Mad Men,\" nominees for best drama include \"Boston Legal,\" \"Dexter,\" \"House\" and \"Lost.\" Comedy series nominees are \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Entourage,\" \"The Office,\" \"30 Rock\" and \"Two and a Half Men.\" Cable series dominated the dramatic acting nominations, with four of the six actors and three of the five actresses appearing on basic or pay cable. Best actor in a drama nominees are Byrne (\"In Treatment\"), Bryan Cranston (\"Breaking Bad\"), Michael C. Hall (\"Dexter\"), Jon Hamm (\"Mad Men\"), Hugh Laurie (\"House\") and James Spader (\"Boston Legal\"). \"Dexter,\" which originated on Showtime, earned a short run on CBS following the writers strike. The nominees for best actress in a drama are Close (\"Damages\"), Sally Field (\"Brothers and Sisters\"), Mariska Hargitay (\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\"), Holly Hunter (\"Saving Grace\") and Kyra Sedgwick (\"The Closer\"). A number of familiar names were included among nominees for comedies. The nominees for best actor in a comedy are Alec Baldwin (\"30 Rock\"), Steve Carell (\"The Office\"), Lee Pace (\"Pushing Daisies\"), Tony Shalhoub (\"Monk\") and Charlie Sheen (\"Two and a Half Men\"). Only Pace is a newcomer. The nominees for best actress in a comedy are Christina Applegate (\"Samantha Who?\"), America Ferrera (\"Ugly Betty\"), Tina Fey (\"30 Rock\"), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (\"The New Adventures of Old Christine\") and Mary-Louise Parker (\"Weeds\"). Sarah Silverman earned three nominations, all for different programs: one for a guest shot on \"Monk,\" another for contributing to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and a third for producing her own \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\" Kristin Chenoweth, Neil Patrick Harris and TV academy Chairman John Shaffner announced the nominations Thursday. Chenoweth was particularly bubbly, throwing in a non sequitur about once dating \"Survivor\" host Jeff Probst and declining to sing \"Happy Birthday\" because \"the Emmys can't afford me to sing that song\" due to licensing arrangements. Both Chenoweth (\"Pushing Daisies\") and Harris (\"How I Met Your Mother\") were nominated in supporting actor categories. Two highly rated shows, \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Desperate Housewives,\" were snubbed. \"Grey's,\" a regular nominee for best drama, was left off that list, though star Sandra Oh was nominated for best supporting actress. \"Housewives,\" which won six Emmys its debut season, was ignored in both best comedy series and best actress in a comedy series categories. Two guest stars did receive nominations. Stephen Colbert, nominated for individual performance in a variety or musical program, put everything in perspective. \"What an honor, unless I don't win,\" he told the AP.

And think about all the compliments you'll get. You'll be the envy of all your friends.\nUser 2: That's true. Okay, I think I'll get it. But now I'm thinking about what else I can get. This handbag looks amazing, don't you think?\nUser 1: Oh, it's gorgeous! But is it really necessary? You already have a great bag.\nUser 2: Yeah, but this one is Chanel. And it's on sale.

It's your money, after all.\nUser 2: (smiling) Thanks, Aunt Cindy. I think I'll get it. And maybe a few other things too.

So, do you spend all your money on it?\nUser 2: No. Fashion is just part of my life, which improves its quality. But also, I'm good at financing. I have a credit card, but I never overdraft.\nUser 1: How is it that you are my mom's sis? You two are so different. She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns. You do so much better than her.\nUser 2: I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits.\nUser 1:\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "So", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

It premiered at the Globe Theatre, London, on 1 March 1966, directed and choreographed by Gillian Lynne.\nThe musical focuses on the lifestyle of the match cutters at the Bryant and May factory in Bow, London, with strong references to the condition Phossy jaw and the political climate of the era.\nProduction history\nAfter out-of-town tryouts in Leatherhead, Surrey, the show opened on the West End in March 1966.

The story follows Kate and Annie's attempts to rally the girls, leading Kate to become a reckless strike-leader and a key player in the creation and recognition of the union.

The story focuses on Kate who felt that the working conditions needed reform and put together a union to demand better working conditions for her and her peers. The musical follows the highs and lows of Kate and peers as they fight for better working conditions.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Only", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I know how to say no to people and I\u2019m not afraid to let someone know when they\u2019ve done something wrong.\nBut I also know where to help\n\nText continuation:\n. I volunteer at a local animal shelter and I love it. It's a great way to get out of my comfort zone and do something that makes me feel good about myself. But even there, I don't really connect with anyone. I just go through the motions and get the job done.\nI've been thinking a lot about why I'm having such a hard time making friends. Is it because I'm too picky? Am I not putting myself out there enough? Do I just not have that \"friend-making\" gene? I've been trying to figure it out, but the more I think about it, the more confused I get.\nI've also been wondering if it's because I'm not \"cool\" enough. I mean, I like the same things as everyone else, but I'm not into the whole \"scene\" thing. I don't go to raves or concerts, and I don't have a fancy car or a trendy haircut. Am I just not \"cool\" enough for people to want to hang out with me?\nI've tried to put myself in other people's shoes and see things from their perspective. I've tried to be more understanding and less judgmental. But no matter what I do, I just can't seem to connect with anyone.\nI've been feeling really down about it lately. I feel like I'm just stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it. I've been thinking about talking to a therapist, but I'm not sure if that's the right step for me.\nI guess what I'm saying is that I'm just really frustrated and confused about why I can't make friends. I know I'm a good person, and I know I have a lot to offer. But for some reason, I just can't seem to connect with anyone.\nI'm not sure what the future holds, but I'm hoping that things will get better. I'm hoping that I'll find some people who share my interests and values, and that we'll be able to have some meaningful conversations and connections. I'm hoping that I'll be able to find a sense of belonging and community, and that I'll be able to feel like I'm a part of something bigger than myself.\nI know it's not going to be easy, but I'm willing to put in the work. I'm willing to keep trying and to keep pushing forward, even when it feels like nothing is working. I'm willing to take risks and to put myself out there, even when it feels scary and uncomfortable.\nI guess what I'm saying is that I'm not giving up. I'm not going to let my lack of friends define me or hold me back. I'm going to keep pushing forward, and I'm going to keep trying to find my place in the world.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I buy homeless people food and drinks. I also saw a coworker to their apartment after an incident that shook them the night beforehand (the coworker actually talked badly about me afterwards which I wasn\u2019t happy about)\nIt\u2019s extremely depressing. I know I need to be surrounded by people. I\u2019ve had to cut off my family too which isn\u2019t helping.\nIm genuinely exhausted of trying to make new friends should I just give up at this point?\nStrongWarmSweet: Do you have mental health problems? I\u2019m asking because you sound interesting, so it must be the opposite problem of being boring.\nAquaticUndercover: What kind of mental health problems? I have a lot of depression and I\u2019m still living with an ed and trauma lol that\u2019s bout it but idk if there\u2019s anything more?\nStrongWarmSweet: That\u2019s probably it. Unfortunately depression repels people\u2026 which only contributes to depression, obviously. That\u2019s probably why they are telling you to smile too. \nI am also depressed. Don\u2019t give up. Try just saying whatever comes to your head when you are around people (as long as it is polite). You may eventually find your people.\nAquaticUndercover: No they tell me to smile as a way of rejecting me. It\u2019s not obvious I\u2019m depressed\nStrongWarmSweet: How do you know that?\nAquaticUndercover: Just common sense\nStrongWarmSweet: Hmmm. I have never heard of that one tbh. I would take it as genuine feedback.\nAquaticUndercover: If they wanted to invite me out then they would\u2019ve right there instead of redirecting me\nStrongWarmSweet: Well yeah but I mean they may be rejecting you because they perceive you to be depressed. Unfortunately that can happen, which creates more depression. It can be a vicious cycle.\nAquaticUndercover: Maybe you are right but if I\u2019m depressed then surely the logical thing to do would be to make sure I\u2019m ok like inviting me out or smth idk. Even if I force a smile and I\u2019m more welcoming I don\u2019t feel like it makes me any closer to people usually they just feel like it\u2019s easier to ask me for favors :/\nStrongWarmSweet: Yeah I agree. People can be awful like that. I tend to have the same experience tbh. I have friends but not many and I tend to run into a lot of entitled people too. It is depressing. \nHave you tried meetups?\nAquaticUndercover: I\u2019ve sort of seen the app is it good?\nStrongWarmSweet: I have just a few friends. Two from back in high school that I see once or twice a year. One from uni I see monthly. One I met in a church group I see once or twice a year. Another I met on meetup that I see monthly. I am also in a relationship with someone I met in uni. But I recommend finding a few buddies before looking for a relationship because that\u2019s easier. \nSo yeah my go-to for myself is school, church and meet up apparently. Don\u2019t worry if the one-on-one hangouts are infrequent because over the years it ends up meaning something. \nMeet up is good because you can enjoy a hobby at the same time.

Hillary Clinton said Sunday some people are using her controversial reference to Robert F. Kennedy's assassination to suggest that she meant something \"completely unthinkable.\" Sen. Hillary Clinton says her supporters urge her to stay in the race until it is over. Her campaign also accused the rival Obama campaign of \"inflaming\" the situation and purposely taking her words out of context. But the Obama campaign said it was not trying to \"stir the issue up.\" In an editorial in the New York Daily News, the Democratic presidential hopeful also acknowledged her dwindling chances of winning the nomination, saying she is aware of \"the odds\" against her. Headlined \"Hillary: Why I continue to run,\" the editorial began with an explanation of her reference to the assassination when she was speaking to the Argus Leader newspaper in South Dakota. She said she was pointing out that presidential primary campaigns have continued into June. \"Almost immediately, some took my comments entirely out of context and interpreted them to mean something completely different -- and completely unthinkable,\" she wrote.  Watch Hillary's camp insist the remark had nothing to do with Obama \u00bb . Clinton said the newspaper's editor and Bobby Kennedy Jr. issued statements arguing that was the meaning of her remark. No other member of the Kennedy family has issued a public statement on the matter. \"I realize that any reference to that traumatic moment for our nation can be deeply painful -- particularly for members of the Kennedy family, who have been in my heart and prayers over this past week,\" she said, in a reference to Sen. Edward Kennedy's diagnosis with brain cancer. \"And I expressed regret right away for any pain I caused. \"But I was deeply dismayed and disturbed that my comment would be construed in a way that flies in the face of everything I stand for -- and everything I am fighting for in this election.\" Some people -- particularly a number of bloggers -- have suggested she was imagining the possibility that Sen. Barack Obama, the likely nominee, could be assassinated. After Clinton's initial remarks to the newspaper were reported, the Obama campaign issued a statement saying the comment \"was unfortunate and has no place in this campaign.\" But Obama himself later said, \"I don't think that Senator Clinton intended anything by it,\" and that \"we should put it behind us.\" Clinton campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe, in an interview Sunday, criticized the Obama campaign's first move. \"It's unfortunate -- a hyped-up press over Memorial Day weekend, the Obama campaign inflaming it, tried to take these words out of context,\" he told \"Fox News Sunday.\" Asked about the remark by Obama himself, McAuliffe responded, \"That's great, but Friday they were all part of this process. The press secretary came out and attacked Senator Clinton and got it going so the story would be around for three days.\" Howard Wolfson, a Clinton adviser, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that the Obama campaign's first statement critical of Clinton was \"unfortunate.\" But Obama's chief strategist David Axelrod told ABC's \"This Week\" that \"we take her at her word,\" and he added, \"We're beyond that issue now, so certainly we're not trying to stir the issue up.\" The program's host, George Stephanopoulos, noted that a member of Obama's staff sent to the media Saturday a \"searing commentary\" by MSNBC's Keith Olbermann slamming Clinton for her remark. \"Mr. Olbermann did his commentary and he had his opinion,\" Axelrod responded, adding, \"As far as we're concerned, this issue is done.\" On another front, Axelrod slammed Clinton for suggesting she leads Obama in the popular vote. Clinton has been making that argument, based on figures that include Florida and Michigan, even though Obama took his name off the ballot in Michigan and neither candidate campaigned in Florida. The Democratic Party discounted both states' primaries before they took place. \"It would take some very tortured math and tortured logic to say that she's ahead in the popular vote,\" Axelrod told ABC. He added, \"This isn't 'American Idol,' OK? This is a nominating process. We have rules. We elect delegates state by state.\" In her column, Clinton said she believes she can still \"win on the merits.\" \"I am not unaware of the challenges or the odds of my securing the nomination -- but this race remains extraordinarily close, and hundreds of thousands of people in upcoming primaries are still waiting to vote,\" she wrote. She added that her parents \"did not raise me to be a quitter -- and too many people still come up to me at my events, grip my arm and urge me not to walk away before this contest is over.\" She also said she is running \"because I believe staying in this race will help unite the Democratic Party. I believe that if Senator Obama and I both make our case -- and all Democrats have the chance to make their voices heard -- in the end, everyone will be more likely to rally around the nominee.\" She repeated her vow to campaign for Obama if he gets the nomination, and wrote, \"No matter what happens in this primary, I am committed to unifying this party.\" Obama was in Middleton, Connecticut, where he was standing in for the ailing Edward Kennedy who was scheduled to deliver the commencement at Wesleyan University.  Watch Obama tell graduates they have an obligation \u00bb . The theme of Obama's speech was service, and the senator asked graduates to volunteer their time at home and abroad to fight poverty, preserve peace and protect the environment . \"But I hope you'll remember, during those times of doubt and frustration, that there is nothing naive about your impulse to change this world,\" he said. \"Because all it takes is one act of service -- one blow against injustice -- to send forth that tiny ripple of hope that Robert Kennedy spoke of.\"\n\nSummary:\nSen.

Unexpectedly\n\nText continuation:\n, other homozygous patients presented a distinct delayed phenotype of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism after 50 years; none had epilepsy or cerebellar ataxia. Another major finding of this study is that all GRN mutations may not have the same impact on progranulin protein synthesis. A hypomorphic effect of some mutations is supported by the presence of residual levels of plasma progranulin and low levels of normal transcript detected in one case with a homozygous splice-site mutation and late onset frontotemporal dementia. This is a new critical finding that must be considered in therapeutic trials based on replacement strategies. The first neuropathological study in a homozygous carrier provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of the disease. Hallmarks of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were present. The absence of TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions markedly differs from observations of heterozygous mutations, suggesting a pathological shift between lysosomal and TDP-43 pathologies depending on the mono or bi-allelic status. An intriguing observation was the loss of normal TDP-43 staining in the nucleus of some neurons, which could be the first stage of the TDP-43 pathological process preceding the formation of typical cytoplasmic inclusions. Finally, this study has important implications for genetic counselling and molecular diagnosis. Semi-dominant inheritance of GRN mutations implies that specific genetic counseling should be delivered to children and parents of CLN11 patients, as they are heterozygous carriers with a high risk of developing dementia. More broadly, this study illustrates the fact that genetic variants can lead to different phenotypes according to their mono- or bi-allelic state, which is a challenge for genetic diagnosis.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Either someone gives them to me or I manage to fix what I've got, else I've got nothing to work with.  :/\nIf I pry the grill off without damaging it, would normal superglue be good enough to put them back on so they don't look like crap?\njonvon65: Ahh, I see. The issue isn't getting the speakers open as much as fixing the blown drivers themselves. I haven't heard many success stories of blown drivers being restored. The only spare speakers I have are little mid rangers from my car (one of them pops when turned too loud but otherwise works fine). I would send them to you but they're 2.75 inches in diameter which is a lot smaller than the ones you have. Normal superglue probably wouldn't adhere that well to the front grills because it's a little too thin. Thicker glue like hot glue or gorilla glue would be better for this situation.\n2LateImDead: I might be able to get some Gorilla glue if it's even fixable.  Probably isn't though, like you said.  Thanks for the offer of those speakers from your car.  I'm pretty sure they're actually about the size of these ones - I shone a light through the mesh to look inside and these things are like 90% casing, the speaker inside is fairly small.  I don't have any exact measurements, though.\nDo you have an estimate of how much it'd cost to mail them?  I live in Virginia.  I don't really have any money because my job sucks and I'm going through college and supporting myself, but I could skip paying my phone bill this month to cover shipping costs, potentially.  But I can't imagine they'd be huge, even shipping from Asia is normally no more than $10, if it's something reasonably small.\njonvon65: Honestly, don't worry about the shipping, I've got you covered. I'm testing them out right now and they're not half bad. Also they're just bare speakers and I'd like to put them in an enclosure of some sort before I ship them. What would you be hooking them up to?\n2LateImDead: I've got an old Sony amplifier that uses the basic black and red speaker wires to hook things up.  It's also got RCA (yellow-white-red, minus the yellow since it's just audio) outputs and inputs.  I've got an AUX-RCA adapter to input sound.  I've never used the RCA outputs but I'm under the impression that they'd work the same, so whatever is easiest for you.\nThanks a bunch, by the way.  I've been really stressed about not having any speakers.  I'll still need to find more, but getting back 2 when I lost 4 cuts the loss in half, which is a big help.  And even 2 is enough to get back to practicing and recording.  :)\nI'll send you a PM with my address.\njonvon65: Ahh ok, good, that makes it easy then! Of course, just letting you know beforehand that these speakers are good quality but they are rather small, you won't be pissing off the neighbors with them. That being said, just don't turn them up too loud and you should be fine. I'll start on building the enclosures tomorrow and hopefully I can get them shipped out to you sometime this week.

The story portrays it like college was out of the question because of money, but i know tons of people who who couldn't afford college so they took out loans. Also a poor girl with stellar grades from the ghetto would be a prime candidate for financial aid. Another story ran on NPR the other day about how poor high acheivers should always aim for the best schools they can because their chances of getting financial aid are very good, and their earnings potential after graduation will be much higher\n\nText continuation:\nIt's a valid point, and it's true that many students from low-income backgrounds have successfully navigated the college application process and secured financial aid to pursue their higher education goals. However, it's also important to consider the systemic barriers and biases that can prevent students like Melanie from even considering college as an option in the first place.\nFor example, research has shown that students from low-income backgrounds often lack access to resources and support systems that can help them navigate the college application process, such as guidance counselors, college preparatory courses, and test preparation materials. Additionally, the cost of applying to college can be prohibitively expensive, with some colleges charging application fees of $50 or more.\nFurthermore, even if Melanie had been aware of the financial aid options available to her, she may have faced skepticism or even outright discouragement from her teachers, counselors, or family members, who may have viewed college as an unrealistic goal for someone from her background. This can be particularly true in communities where there is a lack of representation and visibility of people who have successfully pursued higher education.\nMoreover, the story of Melanie and her classmates highlights the broader issue of educational inequality in the United States. Despite the fact that education is often touted as the key to social mobility, the reality is that students from low-income backgrounds often face significant barriers to accessing high-quality education, from crumbling school buildings and outdated textbooks to lack of access to Advanced Placement courses and extracurricular activities.\nIt's not just about individual students making individual choices, but rather about creating a system that is equitable and just, where every student has access to the resources and opportunities they need to succeed. This requires a commitment to addressing the root causes of educational inequality, from poverty and lack of access to healthcare to systemic racism and bias.\nUltimately, the story of Melanie and her classmates is a powerful reminder of the need for systemic change and a more just and equitable education system. By working to address the barriers and biases that prevent students like Melanie from accessing higher education, we can create a more just and equitable society where every student has the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or zip code.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

If a person knows what they want to do before college age, then go for it. Pour your heart and soul into your \"thing\" that you found to value so much, without the loans. But for the rest of us, we have the option to taking out the loans to expand our capabilities and maybe figure something else out what we want to do. There's always the option of not taking out loans when you don't have a \"thing\" but it will be more difficult to climb the economic ladder. That's almost assuming your goal is to climb the ladder, you are entirely entitled to not - you can stay exactly where you are or drop down a few rungs if you choose to not climb. \nOriginalStomper: &gt;Sometimes you have to take some risks.\nAgreed.  But the risks are disproportionately greater and more intimidating when you are a poor person of color with more chance the risk will not pay off and NO financial safety net.\nnotgod: If you're already poor and no way to pay it off - what is there to lose making an attempt? \nOriginalStomper: When you are poor with no credit, not paying your bills means getting evicted.  Not paying bills is serious.  The underprivileged know that the system works against them -- why should they believe they can take on debt with no adverse consequences?  How would they know?\nnotgod: Because then you're stuck in the same spot for the rest of your life. Pay the important bills, work with the billing company to get into a payment plan, get your shit turned off. Otherwise you're stuck. I'd rather try and fail then just spend my life doing the same thing. Read some biographies of people that have made it, they went for broke and succeeded by taking chances. Society wants you to keep paying your bills, fall in line, be average. If you're fine with that, good, if not, otherwise start making some changes and take some risks. Nobody is going to give you success. \nOriginalStomper: Stuck in the same spot struggling to pay rent and keep the utilities on is at least familiar for these people, and far less scary than being homeless.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Not", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "So", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

He previously served as the 26th Prime Minister of Turkey from 1983 to 1989 as the leader of the Motherland Party. He was the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey in the military government of B\u00fclend Ulusu between 1980 and 1982.\nAfter working briefly at the World Bank in the United States and as a university lecturer, \u00d6zal became the general secretary and later the leader of the main miners' trade union of Turkey in 1979, serving as a chief negotiator during large-scale industrial action in 1977. He unsuccessfully stood for Parliament in the 1977 general election as a National\n\nText continuation:\nSalvation Party candidate. \u00d6zal's experience in the trade union movement and his involvement in industrial action gave him a strong understanding of the working class and the struggles they faced, which would later influence his policies as Prime Minister and President.\n\u00d6zal's entry into politics was marked by his election as the leader of the Motherland Party in 1983, which was a newly formed party that aimed to challenge the dominant political parties in Turkey. As Prime Minister, \u00d6zal implemented a series of economic reforms aimed at liberalizing the Turkish economy and attracting foreign investment. He also pursued a policy of reconciliation with Greece, which had been a major foreign policy issue in Turkey for decades. \u00d6zal's government also implemented a number of social and cultural reforms, including the establishment of a new university system and the introduction of a new penal code.\nAs President, \u00d6zal continued to pursue his economic and social reforms, and also played a key role in the country's foreign policy. He was a strong supporter of Turkey's membership in the European Union and worked closely with European leaders to advance Turkey's bid for membership. \u00d6zal also played a key role in the country's relations with the Middle East, particularly with Iran and Iraq. He was a strong advocate for Turkish-Iranian cooperation and worked to strengthen the two countries' economic and cultural ties.\n\u00d6zal's legacy in Turkey is complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, he is remembered for his economic reforms, which helped to transform Turkey's economy and make it more competitive in the global market. He is also remembered for his efforts to promote social and cultural change, including the establishment of a new university system and the introduction of a new penal code. On the other hand, \u00d6zal's government was also marked by controversy and criticism, particularly with regards to his handling of the Kurdish issue and his relationship with the military. Despite these controversies, \u00d6zal remains one of the most important and influential figures in Turkish politics in the second half of the 20th century.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "On", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "On", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In 1979, he became an undersecretary to Prime Minister S\u00fcleyman Demirel's minority government until the 1980 military coup. As an undersecretary, he played a major role in developing economic reforms, known as the '24 January decisions,' which paved the way for greater neoliberalism in the Turkish economy. After the coup, he was appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey responsible for the economy in B\u00fclend Ulusu's government and continued to implement economic reforms. He resigned in 1982 following disagreements over economic policy.\u00d6zal formed the Motherland Party (ANAP) in 1983 after the ban on political parties was lifted by the military government. ANAP won a parliamentary majority in the 1983 general election and \u00d6zal subsequently became the Prime Minister of Turkey. While implementing several economic reforms concerning the exchange rate and deregulation, a rise in inflation and the growing conflict with Kurdish separatists led to ANAP winning reduced pluralities in the 1984 local elections. Despite a referendum in 1987 allowing politicians banned during the 1980 coup to resume political activities, ANAP was re-elected with a parliamentary majority in the 1987 general election, albeit with a reduced share of the vote. He survived an assassination attempt during a party congress in 1988. \u00d6zal's foreign policy focused on averting war with Greece following the \u015eim\u015fek Incident and temporarily allowed Bulgarian Turks to emigrate to Turkey.\n\u00d6zal was elected President of the Turkish Republic in the 1989 presidential election, while Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Akbulut replaced him as Prime Minister. Despite assuming a ceremonial role with minimal political duties, \u00d6zal remained occupied with government activities, such as intervening in the 1990 Zonguldak miners' strikes. While Akbulut took a docile approach as Prime Minister, disputes over the President's and Prime Minister's duties were dominant when S\u00fcleyman Demirel became Prime Minister after the 1991 general election. The Southeastern Anatolia development project began with the construction of the Atat\u00fcrk Dam in \u015eanl\u0131urfa, while \u00d6zal participated in the first ever summit of Turkic Republics in 1992 held in Ankara. He maintained close relations with the President of the United States George H. W. Bush during the Gulf War and the end of the Cold War. \u00d6zal died unexpectedly while in office in 1993, with an exhumation in 2012 leading to evidence of poisoning but the cause of death was unclear.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Only", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalization of Western society. Weber also saw bureaucracy, however, as a threat to individual freedoms, and the ongoing bureaucratization as leading to a \"polar night of icy darkness\", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in a soulless \"iron cage\" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control Weber's critical study of the bureaucratization of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work.

Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a local pharmacist, produced the syrup for Coca-Cola. It was put on sale at the nearby Jacobs' Pharmacy for five cents a glass as a soda fountain drink. An international organization, The Coca-Cola Company's first soda fountain sales to Canada and Mexico were recorded in 1897. Its first international bottler -- in Panama -- was established in 1906. The company entered China in 1927 and its 100th country -- Sierra Leone -- in 1957. Today, The Coca-Cola Company is the world's largest beverage company with the most extensive distribution system in the world, operating in more than 200 countries across the world. The company currently has over 400 different brands under its control, and is one of the most recognizable names in the commercial world. The Coca-Cola Company, including the bottling entities it owns, employs approximately 71,000 people. More than 58,000 of those employees work for the company outside of the U.S. They are the largest private-sector employer across all of Africa.

Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a local pharmacist, produced the syrup for Coca-Cola. It was put on sale at the nearby Jacobs' Pharmacy for five cents a glass as a soda fountain drink. An international organization, The Coca-Cola Company's first soda fountain sales to Canada and Mexico were recorded in 1897. Its first international bottler -- in Panama -- was established in 1906. The company entered China in 1927 and its 100th country -- Sierra Leone -- in 1957. Today, The Coca-Cola Company is the world's largest beverage company with the most extensive distribution system in the world, operating in more than 200 countries across the world. The company currently has over 400 different brands under its control, and is one of the most recognizable names in the commercial world. The Coca-Cola Company, including the bottling entities it owns, employs approximately 71,000 people. More than 58,000 of those employees work for the company outside of the U.S. They are the largest private-sector employer across all of Africa. And in South Africa, for every one job created by the Coca-Cola system, 16 jobs are created in the informal retail sector. The company was placed in the top 25 places to work by Essence magazine and was named Wal-Mart's International Supplier of the Year in 2006.

However, given that society began very pro-life, I would imagine that the abortion debate would have taken\n\nText continuation:\na different turn if men had to go through the same biological process. Perhaps the focus would shift from the fetus's rights to the mother's autonomy and bodily integrity.\nIt's interesting to consider how societal attitudes towards pregnancy and childbirth have evolved over time. In many ancient cultures, women were seen as vessels for childbirth, and their bodies were often treated as mere containers for the growing fetus. This perspective has slowly changed, and today we recognize the importance of respecting a woman's right to make decisions about her own body.\nBut what about the moral implications of abortion? Do we truly believe that a fetus is a human being, deserving of the same rights and protections as a born individual? Or do we recognize that the moral status of a fetus is more complex, and that the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be left to the individual woman?\nUltimately, the debate around abortion is a deeply personal and emotional one, and it's difficult to find a clear-cut solution. However, by acknowledging the complexity of the issue and engaging in respectful dialogue, we can work towards creating a more compassionate and just society for all individuals, regardless of their gender or reproductive status.\nIn the end, the decision to have an abortion is a difficult one that should be made with careful consideration and respect for all parties involved. While it's impossible to know for certain what the moral status of a fetus is, we can strive to create a world where every individual, regardless of their age or stage of development, is treated with dignity and respect.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

It's easy to get mad at them,  but they're victims too. I can't imagine not being able to appreciate women and yet their society saw fit to rob them of that through ignorance and misdirection. Women absolutely have it worse, but direct your anger at the government and programs that made them this way, first and foremost.\nSakuraba85: Would you say the same thing about Hitler?\nlightknight7777: Hitler formed the society that overthrew\n\nText continuation:\nthe norms of the time, creating a toxic environment that condoned and encouraged the oppression of certain groups. In the same way, the government and societal structures that perpetuate these beliefs about women are also responsible for creating an environment that is hostile towards them. We can't just focus on the individuals who carry out these actions, but also the systems and institutions that enable and perpetuate them.\nAs we continue to discuss this topic, it's essential to recognize that the issue of misogyny and oppression is deeply rooted in societal structures and power dynamics. It's not just about individual people, but about the systems and institutions that perpetuate these beliefs and actions.\nIn the case of Najmia, she is a victim of these societal structures, but she is also a symbol of resistance and defiance. Her decision to not wear her hijab despite being harassed is a powerful statement against the oppressive norms that seek to control her and other women. It's a reminder that women have the power to resist and challenge these norms, and that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.\nAs we move forward, it's crucial that we continue to have these conversations and challenge the societal structures that perpetuate misogyny and oppression. We need to recognize that these issues are complex and multifaceted, and that they require a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of these problems.\nUltimately, it's up to us to create a society that values and respects all individuals, regardless of their gender, race, religion, or any other characteristic. We need to work towards a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential, free from the constraints of oppressive societal structures.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I would say the children in Hitler youth were first generation victims. \nYou don't get to be a victim of the system when you installed it.\nWhat's more is a bully who was made a bully by the system is still a bully.  You can be a victim and also an asshole. You can be mad at Hitler and the environment that raised him. But Hitler had access to different viewpoints and picked the one he arrived at despite education. These kids don't have that luxury. When someone disagrees,  men with sticks show up and beat the hell out of them.\nSakuraba85: What do you mean? Hitler was shaped by his education and upbringing just like these men. \nHe grew up with being ashamed of how Germany acted and was treated after WW1 and was taught about that in school and his society.\nlightknight7777: The reason Hitler was evil wasn't him being mad at how Germany was treated.  It wasn't even him wanting to make Germany powerful again.  Conquerers have existed all throughout history without being known from then on as evil.  It was the \"genocide\" bit that made him the image of evil. Out of a plethora of perfectly viable options, he decided on concentration camps and murder. \nThere's a massive difference between being raised to think something bad is \"the truth\" vs specifically seeking out something bad to believe in from options. He arrived at his particular brand of insanity after significant research and adult social circles. You can be mad at him even having that path to come to. Heck, antisemitism was super common at the time (even in the US), but him going \"therefore let's remove them\" was  on him. Every other government was managing to not round them up and murder them.\nSakuraba85: Ok, i understand. It\u2019s not evil wanting to hang children because they don\u2019t want to have fabric on their heads. Got it. It\u2019s not their fault.\nlightknight7777: As I stated,  a bully who was made a bully by their system is still a bully. Them espousing the evil beliefs they were taught is still bad but they are also victims as well. \nWhat you don't seem to be accepting is my primary point that the system that produces evil is more evil than the individuals. At no point did I say they weren't espousing evil. But you strawmanning my position is unnecessary.\nmynameisnotlarrybob: Good job, you won!\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "You", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Everywhere online i see tips like \"have an interesting life\" \"do some stuff and attract people\" here's a thing: i consider myself interesting person, i do graphic design, photography, ilustration/painting, a bit of programming - but it's only interesting to me. I don't even try to portray myself as outgoing vivid person because i know that would be lying, but even if i tried - am i supposed to take my date to art gallery to bore her completely ? Or maybe take her home to sit in front of my computer (where 90% of the work im doing is done lol) i don't want to change either. Has anyone\n\nText continuation:\nelse ever felt like this? Like, you're not trying to be boring, but you're just genuinely interested in things that others might not find exciting? I've tried to make small talk and pretend to be into things that I'm not, but it always feels so fake and I end up feeling like I'm wasting my time. I've also tried to be more open about my interests, but it seems like people are just polite and pretend to be interested, but then they don't actually follow up or ask me more about it.\nI've started to feel like I'm just not cut out for the whole dating scene. Like, I'm not a party animal, I don't like loud music or crowded places, and I don't really care about sports or pop culture. I'm just a quiet, introverted person who likes to spend time alone or with a few close friends, doing things that bring me joy. And that seems to be a major turn-off for most people. I've tried to compromise and do things that I think others might like, but it always feels like I'm sacrificing a part of myself to try to fit in. And honestly, I'm just tired of feeling like I have to be someone I'm not in order to be liked or accepted.\nI've also started to wonder if it's even worth it. Like, is it really worth putting myself out there and risking rejection and disappointment, just to try to find someone who might be interested in me for who I am? Or is it better to just focus on my own happiness and fulfillment, and not worry about what others think? I don't know, I'm just really confused and frustrated right now. Has anyone else ever felt like this? Like, you're just trying to find someone who gets you, but it seems like nobody does?\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I feel like guys who party and drink have it easier with girls.

Any tips what should i do ? Im 24yo btw. Thanks\nghxststories: Well i think your problem may be that you think girls are only interested in snapchat and instagram.\nJust you know.\nComing from a female designer/programmer who thought you sounded pretty dope til I read that line.\nfuckyeapancakes: So you don't expect a guy to take you somewhere cool on a date ? You don't need to show up to your friends party to show yourself with a bf ? Im sorry but pretty much all females i've met so far were like that. How am i supposed to think differently when life long experience days otherwise ?\nghxststories: No, I don't go to parties or have partners to show them off! Yeah I expect cool dates, but to me thatd be going to mini golf or an arcade or just getting take out and watching a movie. \nI think youre looking in the wrong places, or going after the wrong kind of girls for you :) \nAlso, 24 is still young, im 27 now and only just figuring out what im into, your life experience is probably college age girls and guys who dont have it figured out yet, maybe ya gotta go for an older lady!\nEither way, suggesting an entire gender are only into one thing, probs not the best way to go about it.\nfuckyeapancakes: What are good places then ? Please don't write \"everywhere\" i need specific tips, i also suspect that most girls i would be into, are hiding in their houses :/ i don't think 24 is that young, it's not old yet either but most people around me have it figured out\nghxststories: I think the hardest part no doubt is putting yourself out there, I feel like youre already destining yourself to fail thinking you'll bore people, but as cheesy as it sounds, as long as youre passionate about something that will shine through and make you seem interesting. And if people aint interested in you for what youre intested in, fuck em.\nIf you've got your stuff sorted at 24, damn well work that! Appreciate yourself for a while, and dont rush to try and find someone else. I was scared to be single for so long, and now I am learning to embrace it.\nShe says, binge eating cheese and watching jumanji \ud83d\ude04\nfuckyeapancakes: Ok thanks, im actually trying my best to look for people online but people seem to be more picky and not-easily-impressed when online.

It differs from existing freely-available software mainly in that the scattering matrices used to describe the receiver and its components are analytic rather than numeric. This allows different types of modeling and analysis of receivers to be performed. Non-ideal behavior of receiver components can be parameterized in their scattering matrices.

It is particularly useful for designers of receivers for radio astronomy, radar, and other applications where high sensitivity and selectivity are required. The library's ability to model non-ideal component behavior allows for the analysis of receiver performance in the presence of noise and interference, and the optimization of receiver design to minimize these effects.\nOne of the key benefits of SNS is its ability to perform fast and accurate simulations of receiver behavior. This is achieved through the use of analytic scattering matrices, which allow for the rapid calculation of receiver output signals and noise levels. This enables designers to quickly explore the performance of different receiver architectures and optimize their design to meet specific requirements. Additionally, the library's ability to model non-ideal component behavior allows for the analysis of receiver performance in the presence of noise and interference, and the optimization of receiver design to minimize these effects.\nIn addition to its analytical capabilities, SNS also provides a range of visualization tools for analyzing and interpreting receiver performance. These tools allow users to visualize the signal and noise levels at different points in the receiver, and to identify areas where optimization is needed. This enables designers to quickly and effectively optimize their receiver designs, and to ensure that they meet the required performance specifications.\nOverall, SNS is a powerful tool for receiver design and analysis, providing a comprehensive framework for modeling and simulating receiver architectures. Its ability to model non-ideal component behavior, perform fast and accurate simulations, and provide visualization tools make it an essential tool for designers of receivers for radio astronomy, radar, and other applications.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

SNS enables the instrument designer to then derive analytic expressions for the signal and noise at the receiver outputs in terms of parameterized component imperfections, and predict their contribution to receiver\n\nText continuation:\nsystematic errors precisely. This can drive the receiver design process by, for instance, allowing the instrument designer to identify which component imperfections contribute most to receiver systematic errors, and hence place firm specifications on individual components. Using SNS to perform this analysis is preferable to traditional Jones matrix-based analysis as it includes internal reflections and is able to model noise: two effects which Jones matrix analysis is unable to describe. SNS can be used to model any receiver in which the components can be described by scattering matrices. Of particular interest to the sub-mm and terahertz frequency regime is the choice between coherent and direct detection technologies. Steady improvements in mm and sub-mm Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) mean that coherent receivers with LNAs as their first active element are becoming increasingly competitive, in terms of sensitivity, with bolometer-based receivers at frequencies above ~100 GHz. As an example of the utility of SNS, we use it to compare two polarimeter architectures commonly used to perform measurements of the polarized Cosmic Microwave Background: differencing polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in polarization sensitive bolometer-based polarimeters; and pseudo-correlation polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in coherent, LNA-based, polarimeters. We parameterize common sources of receiver systematic errors in both architectures and compare them through their Mueller matrices, which encode how well the instruments measure the Stokes parameters of the incident radiation. These analytic Mueller matrices are used to demonstrate the different sources of systematic errors in differencing and correlation polarimeters.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Only", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The \"Barbie Bandits\" helped their hometown earn the dubious distinction as the nation's bank robbery capital. Here one of the so-called \"Barbie Bandits\" is captured on surveillance video at a surburban Atlanta bank. Atlanta's FBI field division topped Los Angeles in reporting the most bank heists, with 350 for the 12 months ending September 30, 2007, according to the FBI, which annually names areas most prone to bank robberies. The Los Angeles area was No. 2 with 338 heists, followed by Philadelphia with 316. Just Thursday, two suspects overpowered a security guard at an Atlanta, Georgia, bank, took his gun, robbed the bank and fled with money in hand, police said. Eventually, police shot one of the suspects in an exchange of gunfire. Two more armed bank robberies took place in metro Atlanta Friday. The FBI says violent crime is up across the nation, especially in major metro areas like Atlanta. So it's no surprise Atlanta has become a prime target for bank robberies, FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett told CNN.  Watch Hotlanta or Heistlanta? \u00bb . \"This goes hand in hand with those figures,\" Emmett said. Atlanta's rapid growth over the last decade has also been a factor. A recent Atlanta Business Chronicle article reported that metro Atlanta has 26 more banks than in all of North Carolina -- roughly one bank for every 3,500 people in the region.  See photos of bank heists in metro Atlanta \u00bb . \"We would attribute a lot of that [bank robberies] to the growth and the fact that the banking industry has matched that growth with an increase in bank branches throughout the area,\" Emmett said. Atlanta's rise in bank heists comes just as Los Angeles has aggressively countered once out-of-control bank robberies. Los Angeles has gone from more than 500 bank robberies in the mid-2000s to this year's 338, the FBI stats show. According to the FBI, its Atlanta field division reported 350 bank robberies in the last year -- the most notorious of which were the \"Barbie Bandits\" and \"Grandpa Bandit\" robberies. The FBI says 122 of the heists were armed robberies, or robberies where a weapon was visibly used. Emmett said many more of the robberies were what law enforcement officers classify as \"note jobs\" -- where a robber gestures as if he or she has a gun on them in a demand note handed over to the teller. Also factored into the total number of robberies were ATM heists and a record nine armored car robberies. Those armored car robberies are particularly disturbing to Emmett. \"Anyone that would confront an armored car courier knowing that he's already armed and in somewhat of a defensive posture, that mindset is very troubling for law enforcement,\" he said. While Emmett said there is no \"typical\" bank robber, he said he has seen some trends, most notably that they are often people battling drug addictions. He also said bank robbers are often repeat offenders. Two recent high-profile cases in Atlanta seem to confirm that. Two women dubbed the \"Barbie Bandits\" were arrested after working with a bank employee to rob a Bank of America in the Atlanta suburb of Acworth. They both later admitted to police to having drug addiction problems. Recently apprehended 69-year-old Bobby Joe Phillips, dubbed the \"Grandpa Bandit,\" is suspected to have robbed seven banks in Tennessee and the Atlanta area and had a criminal history. Emmett says typically very little money is taken in a bank heist. Joe Brannen, president of the Georgia Bankers Association, agrees, saying \"the average is $2,000 to $3,000. It's not as big a payoff as most people think it is.\" With the holidays in full swing, authorities are steeling themselves for a spate of bank robberies with robbers looking for quick holiday cash. \"I would make the assumption that a large part of it is the increased [financial] pressures this time of year,\" said Brannen. The FBI advises banks to be extra vigilant this time of year and to keep a close eye on jittery individuals donning gloves, hats and sunglasses. But Brannen says profiling people like that can be problematic. \"We've chosen not to go there. Here in Atlanta, lots of people wear head coverings for religious purposes. This is a free and open society,\" he said. He said customers want to come into a bank unimpeded -- that 99.9 percent are just customers, not bank robbers. Brannen says banks do all they can to balance convenience for their customers and the bank's need for security. \"There is no good, magic solution.\" he says. Emmett said as long as metro Atlanta continues to grow, so will the number of bank robberies. \"This is something that is part of growth. We have more banks. We have more people. We're a big city now.\" E-mail to a friend .

Don't be so quick to write off the unofficial story\nDug\n\nText continuation:\nAs I was saying, the concept of a corrupt government and military complex is not a new idea, and it's not just limited to the United States. Many people around the world have been vocal about their distrust of their governments and the powerful institutions that shape their societies. The question is, what drives this distrust, and why do some people feel the need to seek out alternative explanations for major events?\nOne possible answer lies in the psychological concept of \"cognitive dissonance.\" This refers to the discomfort or stress that people feel when they are confronted with information that contradicts their beliefs or values. When a major event occurs, such as a terrorist attack or a natural disaster, people may feel a sense of dissonance between what they know to be true and what they are being told by the authorities. This can lead them to seek out alternative explanations that help to reduce their dissonance and restore a sense of order to their world.\nAnother factor that may contribute to the rise of conspiracy theories is the increasing complexity and uncertainty of modern life. In the past, people may have had a clearer understanding of the world and their place in it, but in today's globalized and rapidly changing world, many people feel lost and uncertain. Conspiracy theories can provide a sense of control and understanding in a chaotic world, and they can also serve as a way to assign blame and responsibility for the problems that we face.\nOf course, not everyone is susceptible to the allure of conspiracy theories, and there are many people who are skeptical of such claims. But for those who are drawn to them, it's often because they offer a way to make sense of the world and to find meaning in the face of uncertainty.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

They say they like a certain musician, listen to that musician before the next time you see them so you can comment on that.  The easiest way to fake an interest in a person is not to fake it, genuinely look into what they are interested in.  \nIt doesn't even have to be something you like.  My friend is a football fan, and I fucking hate sports.  But I know the team she likes and the team she hates, and I put stuff from the team she hates on her desk at work.  Even if you do something annoying to tease a friend, at least do it in a way that shows you listen to what they say and see them.\nPhysical_Key_4041: so with the musician example say I listen to a band they recommend, how would I then comment about that band in the follow up conversation\nlike for example I like avatar the last air bender (show) yet even if I meet someone else who likes the show I wouldn\u2019t know how to talk about it with them, like do I just say \u201cI liked the band you recommended\u201d surely not that ain\u2019t really a convo, so like say I listen to the band they recommend, how would I then discuss that band with them \nor take avatar the last airbender how would I discuss the show with someone that\u2019s already seen it\nthe_entroponaut: That's an interesting question, because I guess if I said \"It will just flow from there\" then that wouldn't be helpful at all!  \nIt is tricky to answer though, because conversations are so dynamic that it is hard to apply programmatic rules to them.  I mean, I loved The Last Airbender, but it is hard to come up with cold topics about it.  Personally I might bring up themes of apotheosis in shows (though some people might think I'm pretentious for that, but I am pretentious so I guess that's just me).  Or how I really love that the series format can grant a long time for several character development arcs that a movie can't, evolving into a metal bender or a blood bender and such.  Basically you are going to go into some (but not exhaustive) detail about why you liked it, and your favorite parts, and find out theirs.\nAnd that guidelines applies to most topics.  Music talk tends to be a bit more shallow (unless you are a musician) than movie/TV talk.  It's usually along a format of \"I liked this band, it reminded me of this band, have you heard of them?\"  A finding common ground kind of thing.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "So", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

There has been numerous studies that show a correlation between saturated and trans fat intake with atherosclerosis.  Here is one of the many.\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18175752\n&gt; CONCLUSION: Higher habitual intakes of saturated and trans fats are independently associated with increased subclinical atherosclerosis, and alcohol intake may attenuate the relation between saturated fat and subclinical atherosclerosis.\nI appreciate WSJ opinion piece but *it should not be confused with actual science*.  It is one individual casting doubt on a very large body of evidence, which is admittedly still understudied.  I would put\n\nText continuation:\nmore stock in the collective findings of the scientific community, rather than relying on a single opinion piece.  In fact, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have both issued statements recommending limiting dietary intake of saturated and trans fats to reduce the risk of heart disease.\nFurthermore, the evidence is not just limited to observational studies, but also includes randomized controlled trials. For example, a 2014 meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 28%. Similarly, a 2016 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a low-fat diet reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 22% compared to a low-carbohydrate diet.\nIt's also important to note that the scientific community is not monolithic, and there is ongoing debate and discussion about the optimal dietary approach for heart health. However, the overwhelming majority of evidence suggests that reducing intake of saturated and trans fats is an important step in reducing the risk of heart disease.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Only", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Because they are based on a straightforward formalism, they are used in many scientific fields from computer science to historical sciences. In this paper, we give an introduction to some methods relying on graphs for learning. This includes both unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in latent spaces and/or clustering the nodes. Both focus on extracting knowledge from graph topologies. While most existing techniques are only applicable to static graphs, where edges do not evolve through time, recent developments have shown that they could be extended to deal with evolving networks. In a supervised context, one generally aims at inferring labels\n\nText continuation:\n.\nFor instance, in the field of computer vision, graphs have been used to model the relationships between pixels in an image, allowing for the recognition of objects and scenes. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent pixels, and the edges represent the spatial relationships between them. By applying graph-based algorithms to this graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the image that are not easily discernible by other means. This has led to significant advances in image recognition and segmentation.\nIn addition to computer vision, graphs have also been used in other fields such as social network analysis, where they are used to model the relationships between individuals or groups. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent individuals or groups, and the edges represent the relationships between them, such as friendship, family relationships, or professional connections. By analyzing the graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the relationships between individuals or groups, which can be used to gain insights into social phenomena.\nFurthermore, graphs have also been used in biology to model the relationships between genes, proteins, and other biological molecules. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent the molecules, and the edges represent the interactions between them, such as protein-protein interactions or gene regulation. By analyzing the graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the relationships between molecules, which can be used to gain insights into biological processes and to identify potential therapeutic targets.\nIn conclusion, graphs are a powerful tool for characterizing interactions between objects of interest, and they have been used in a wide range of fields, from computer science to biology. By applying graph-based algorithms to these graphs, it is possible to extract knowledge and insights that would not be easily discernible by other means. As the field of graph-based learning continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more innovative applications of graphs in the future.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Balancing the two sources of information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally or globally. In both contexts, supervised and un-supervised, data can be relational (augmented with one or several global graphs) as described above, or graph valued. In this latter case, each object of interest is given as a full graph (possibly completed by other characteristics). In this context, natural tasks include graph clustering (as in producing clusters of graphs rather than clusters of nodes in a single graph), graph classification, etc. 1 Real networks One of the first practical studies on graphs can be dated back to the original work of Moreno [51] in the 30s. Since then, there has been a growing interest in graph analysis associated with strong developments in the modelling and the processing of these data. Graphs are now used in many scientific fields. In Biology [54, 2, 7], for instance, metabolic networks can describe pathways of biochemical reactions [41], while in social sciences networks are used to represent relation ties between actors [66, 56, 36, 34]. Other examples include powergrids [71] and the web [75]. Recently, networks have also been considered in other areas such as geography [22] and history [59, 39]. In machine learning, networks are seen as powerful tools to model problems in order to extract information from data and for prediction purposes. This is the object of this paper. For more complete surveys, we refer to [28, 62, 49, 45]. In this section, we introduce notations and highlight properties shared by most real networks. In Section 2, we then consider methods aiming at extracting information from a unique network. We will particularly focus on clustering methods where the goal is to find clusters of vertices.

Out of a plethora of perfectly viable options, he decided on concentration camps and murder. \nThere's a massive difference between being raised to think something bad is \"the truth\" vs specifically seeking out something bad to believe in from options. He arrived at his particular brand of insanity after significant research and adult social circles. You can be mad at him even having that path to come to. Heck, antisemitism was super common at the time (even in the US), but him going \"therefore let's remove them\" was  on him.

Them espousing the evil beliefs they were taught is still bad but they are also victims as well. \nWhat you don't seem to be accepting is my primary point that the system that produces evil is more evil than the individuals.

However, other branches of artificial intelligence have designed crucial ingredients towards autonomous learning: curiosity and intrinsic motivation, social learning and natural interaction with peers, and embodiment. These mechanisms guide exploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep learning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made great advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human learning. As argued convincingly by Lake et al., differences include human capabilities to learn causal models of the world from very little data, leveraging compositional representations and\n\nText continuation:\nhierarchical abstraction. Moreover, humans exhibit a remarkable ability to generalize and adapt to new situations, often relying on incomplete or noisy data.\nOne of the key challenges in developing autonomous lifelong learning systems is the ability to balance exploration and exploitation. Humans are able to strike a delicate balance between exploring new possibilities and exploiting what they already know, allowing them to adapt to changing environments and learn from experience. In contrast, current DL systems often struggle to balance these two competing goals, leading to a lack of adaptability and flexibility. To overcome this challenge, researchers are exploring new approaches that combine elements of curiosity-driven exploration with reinforcement learning, allowing agents to learn through trial and error while also adapting to new situations.\nAnother important consideration is the role of embodiment in autonomous learning. Humans learn and adapt through a combination of sensory input and motor output, allowing them to interact with the world in a meaningful way. In contrast, current DL systems are often limited to processing abstract representations of data, without the ability to interact with the physical world. To develop more human-like autonomous learning systems, researchers are exploring new approaches that integrate sensory-motor feedback with deep learning, allowing agents to learn through direct interaction with the environment.\nIn conclusion, autonomous lifelong development and learning is a complex and multifaceted capability that is still beyond the reach of current artificial intelligence systems. However, by combining elements of curiosity, social learning, and embodiment with deep learning, researchers are making progress towards developing more human-like autonomous learning systems. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, we may eventually develop systems that are capable of truly autonomous lifelong learning, with the potential to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, education, and beyond.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

However, there are other fundamental differences between current DL systems and human learning, as well as technical ingredients to fill this gap, that are either superficially, or not adequately, discussed by Lake et al. These fundamental mechanisms relate to autonomous development and learning. They are bound to play a central role in artificial intelligence in the future. Current DL systems require engineers to manually specify a task-specific objective function for every new task, and learn through off-line processing of large training databases. On the contrary, humans learn autonomously open-ended repertoires of skills, deciding for themselves which goals to pursue or value, and which skills to explore, driven by intrinsic motivation/curiosity and social learning through natural interaction with peers. Such learning processes are incremental, online, and progressive. Human child development involves a progressive increase of complexity in a curriculum of learning where skills are explored, acquired, and built on each other, through particular ordering and timing. Finally, human learning happens in the physical world, and through bodily and physical experimentation, under severe constraints on energy, time, and computational resources.

The train, inaugurated in 1946, originally ran from Cincinnati, Ohio, to New Orleans, Louisiana, via Louisville, Nashville, Birmingham, Montgomery and Mobile and later via a connection at Bowling Green, Kentucky, to Memphis, Tennessee. A connection to Chicago was provided by the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad.\nThe Humming Bird had separate sections in the north and the south. The main northern part originated in Cincinnati; other sections (of the L&N's Georgian) originated in St. Louis and from Chicago. These sections linked with the main part of the train in Nashville. At Bowling Green, Kentucky, a southwest-bound section broke off, bound for Memphis; whereas the main southern route continued south to\n\nText continuation:\nMobile, Alabama, where it connected with the Gulf Coast Limited, a train operated by the Illinois Central Railroad.\nThe Humming Bird was known for its luxurious accommodations, including sleeping cars, dining cars, and observation cars. The train featured a distinctive silver and blue color scheme, with a logo featuring a hummingbird, which was a symbol of the railroad. The train was also famous for its on-board amenities, including fine dining, entertainment, and comfortable sleeping quarters.\nAs the years went by, the Humming Bird continued to operate, with occasional changes to its route and schedule. In the 1960s, the train was modified to include air-conditioned cars, and in the 1970s, it was upgraded to include diesel locomotives. Despite these changes, the Humming Bird remained a popular choice for travelers, particularly those looking for a comfortable and convenient way to travel between the Midwest and the Gulf Coast.\nIn the 1980s, the Humming Bird was merged with other trains operated by the L&N, and it was eventually discontinued in the 1990s. However, its legacy lives on, with many railroad enthusiasts still fondly remembering the train's luxurious accommodations and scenic route. Today, the Humming Bird is remembered as a symbol of the golden age of American rail travel, a time when trains were the primary mode of transportation and the railroad was a vital part of the country's infrastructure.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Also, en route to New Orleans, a connecting bus option in Flomaton, Alabama assisted with travel to Pensacola, Florida, while trains were used for the northbound trip.\nIn the mid-1950s, Train 5 departed Louisville at 10:05 pm for New Orleans. Train 6 was the northbound number.\nThe original equipment was part of a 28-car order of four train sets of lightweight stainless steel cars built in 1946 by ACF. Fourteen cars were assigned to the Humming Bird and fourteen to the Georgian. Many of those cars were removed from service in the late 1960s due to severe corrosion problems.\nThe L&N Railroad served the old Union Station in Memphis, until its closure on April 1, 1964. The railroad then used Central Station. Both L&N and Southern Railway were forced to reopen part of Union Station on December 1, 1966, and use it until March 30, 1968.\nThe Humming Bird was canceled on January 9, 1969. At that time, the L&N Railroad earned some unwanted publicity when it terminated the final run of the train en route southbound at Birmingham when a federal judge lifted the order keeping the train running after the Interstate Commerce Commission approved its permanent discontinuance. The passengers were then bused to their destinations.\nThe train inspired the song \"Hummingbird\" by country artist Ricky Skaggs and was mentioned in the song \"Southern Rains\" by country artist Mel Tillis.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Only", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Delta cancellations will affect flights up until early Friday, according to a statement from the airline. The cancellations will affect flights through Friday, according to statements by both companies. A spokeswoman for Delta earlier said 325 flights would be canceled Thursday, but later said 275 flights were cut. \"Delta apologizes in advance for any inconvenience this may cause and is working to proactively contact and reaccommodate affected customers. Customers should call ahead to check flight status,\" a Delta statement said. Wednesday, American Airlines canceled 318 flights, said company spokesman Tim Wagner. The airline canceled 132 of its estimated 2,300 flights scheduled for Thursday, Wagner said, about 6 percent of the daily schedule. The cancellations forced dozens of people to spend the night in the atrium of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. They slept wherever they could -- on couches, on the floor, some on non-moving baggage carousels. Kelly said the airline rebooked flights and covered the cost of hotel and food for passengers on canceled flights. It was initially believed that Delta's MD-90 planes were part of the inspection but it was determined that the MD-88 planes were the only ones that needed to be inspected, a spokeswoman said. The airline said the checks are voluntary and are expected to be completed by week's end. American Airlines, meanwhile, is examining wiring secured to its MD-80 aircraft. In Atlanta, the cancellations caused grousing among passengers who missed job interviews, connecting flights and the comfort of their beds, CNN affiliate WXIA reported. \"They told us 6:45 (p.m.). Then they told us 7:30. Then 8, so on and so forth and they just canceled,\" passenger Fred Billizon told WXIA. \"So they had about 200 people just waiting on flights. And that's not a lot of happy people.\" This latest round of inspections was prompted by questions raised by the FAA and American safety officials about how a certain bundle of wires is secured to the MD-80 aircraft. The MD-80 is the workhorse of the American fleet. American's Web site says the aircraft accounts for 300 of the airline's fleet of 655 jets. The jet debuted in 1980 from McDonnell-Douglas, which was purchased by rival Boeing in 1997. Boeing discontinued production of the aircraft in 1999.

Kelly said the airline rebooked flights and covered the cost of hotel and food for passengers on canceled flights. It was initially believed that Delta's MD-90 planes were part of the inspection but it was determined that the MD-88 planes were the only ones that needed to be inspected, a spokeswoman said. The airline said the checks are voluntary and are expected to be completed by week's end. American Airlines, meanwhile, is examining wiring secured to its MD-80 aircraft. In Atlanta, the cancellations caused grousing among passengers who missed job interviews, connecting flights and the comfort of their beds, CNN affiliate WXIA reported. \"They told us 6:45 (p.m.). Then they told us 7:30. Then 8, so on and so forth and they just canceled,\" passenger Fred Billizon told WXIA. \"So they had about 200 people just waiting on flights. And that's not a lot of happy people.\" This latest round of inspections was prompted by questions raised by the FAA and American safety officials about how a certain bundle of wires is secured to the MD-80 aircraft. The MD-80 is the workhorse of the American fleet. American's Web site says the aircraft accounts for 300 of the airline's fleet of 655 jets. The jet debuted in 1980 from McDonnell-Douglas, which was purchased by rival Boeing in 1997. Boeing discontinued production of the aircraft in 1999.

In Taiwan, food is not just something you eat to sustain yourself, it's an experience, a way to bring people together. And now, as a student in the States, I miss that so much. The familiarity of the dishes, the comfort of the aromas, the joy of sharing a meal with friends and family.

Barack Obama decisively defeated Sen. Hillary Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday, but Clinton's narrow victory in Indiana will likely send the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on to the next round of primaries. Sen. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, greet supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina. As polls closed in Indiana, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Obama, but by the end of the evening, Clinton's lead had shrunk, dragging the race out until early Wednesday. A clear winner did not emerge until 1:15 a.m. Wednesday -- seven hours after the polls closed -- because results were slow to come in from Lake County, a Chicago suburb in northwestern Indiana with several precincts that went strongly for Obama. By Wednesday morning, all absentee ballots had been counted in Lake County and the final results showed Obama had taken the county by 12 percentage points. There were 115 delegates at stake in North Carolina and 72 in Indiana. Because Democratic delegates are awarded proportionally, Obama added four delegates to his lead, according to CNN estimates. Obama earlier claimed a decisive victory in North Carolina. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Obama held a 14-point lead over Clinton.  Watch analysis of NC, IN primaries \u00bb . \"Some were saying that North Carolina would be a game-changer in this election. But today, what North Carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in Washington,\" Obama told supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Watch Obama thank his supporters \u00bb . Obama took an overwhelming 91 percent of the black vote in North Carolina, according to exit polls, while Clinton claimed only 6 percent. Clinton took 59 percent of the white vote compared to 36 percent for Obama, according to the polls. Clinton told her supporters in Indianapolis, \"it's full-speed on to the White House.\"  Watch Clinton greet her supporters \u00bb . Clinton made a strong pitch to blue-collar workers in Indiana. She pulled a majority of the votes in rural and suburban Indiana during Tuesday's primary. In CNN exit polling, Clinton took 53 percent of the vote in suburban areas, compared with 47 percent for Obama of Illinois. She took 68 percent of the rural vote compared with Obama's 32 percent. In all, 1,738 voters were polled. Clinton had pitched herself as the candidate best-suited to turn around a flailing economy and consciously courted working-class voters in the state -- even driving a pickup truck up to a gas pump once to help promote her proposed temporary rollback of federal tax on gasoline. \"I believe that Americans need a champion in their corners,\" she said at a rally in Indianapolis. \"For too long we've had a president who has stood up and spoken out for the wealthy and the well-connected, but I don't think that's what Americans need. \"Standing up for working people is about the American dream and about the Democratic Party; standing up for the middle class is who we are and what we can be if we stick together.\" Eighty-nine percent of Indiana voters said they have been affected by what they called a recession. Clinton had a slight edge when voters were asked who is most likely to improve the economy -- taking 49 percent to Obama's 47 percent. The candidates now turn their attention to the upcoming contests in West Virginia, Kentucky and Oregon. According to early exit polls, half of Clinton's supporters in Indiana would not vote for Obama in a general election matchup with Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.  Watch what the exit polls show \u00bb . A third of Clinton voters said they would pick McCain over Obama, while 17 percent said they would not vote at all. Forty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would back Obama in November. Obama got even less support from Clinton backers in North Carolina, where 45 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for him over McCain. Thirty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for McCain while 12 percent said they would not vote. Obama voters appear to be more willing to support Clinton in November. In Indiana, 59 percent of Obama backers said they'd vote for Clinton, and 70 percent of Obama backers in North Carolina said vote for her against McCain. Obama on Tuesday said he didn't agree with those who said his party would not be able to unite. \"Tonight, many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided -- that Sen. Clinton's supporters will not support me, and that my supporters will not support her,\" he said. \"I'm here tonight to tell you that I don't believe it. Yes, there have been bruised feelings on both sides. Yes, each side desperately wants their candidate to win. But ultimately, this race is not about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain. \"This election is about you -- the American people -- and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future.\" Obama currently leads in pledged delegates and in states won, and he is ahead in the popular vote, if Florida and Michigan are not factored into the equation. Those states are being penalized for moving their primaries up in violation of party rules. With neither candidate expected to win the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination by June 3, the end of the primary season, the final decision will most likely fall to the 796 superdelegates: Democratic governors, members of Congress and party officials.  Watch how superdelegates could come into play \u00bb . Both candidates have spent the past two weeks shuttling between Indiana and North Carolina, each arguing to crucial working-class voters that their rival is out of touch when it comes to the pocketbook issues that are dominating the campaign. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Dan Lothian and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.\n\nSummary:\nSen. Barack Obama defeats Sen.

Most of the divergences found in the litterature are used in the field of information theory to quantify the difference between two probability density functions, that is between positive data whose sum is equal to one. In such context, they take a simplified form that is not adapted to the problems considered here, in which the data fields are non-negative but with a sum not necessarily equal to one. In a systematic way, we reconsider the classical divergences and we give their forms adapted to inverse problems. To this end, we will recall the methods allowing to build such divergences, and propose some\n\nText continuation:\n.\nIn particular, we will focus on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Hellinger distance, and the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which are commonly used in information theory. We will show how these divergences can be modified to be suitable for linear inverse problems, where the data fields are non-negative and do not necessarily sum up to one. We will also introduce new divergences that are specifically designed for these problems.\nThe proposed divergences will be tested on various linear inverse problems, such as image deblurring, tomography, and spectroscopy. We will demonstrate their effectiveness in quantifying the discrepancy between the observed data and the reconstructed images, and show how they can be used to improve the reconstruction algorithms.\nFurthermore, we will discuss the connection between the proposed divergences and other metrics used in linear inverse problems, such as the mean squared error and the peak signal-to-noise ratio. We will also explore the potential applications of the proposed divergences in other fields, such as machine learning and signal processing.\nThroughout the book, we will provide numerous examples and illustrations to help the reader understand the concepts and methods presented.

Most of the divergences found in the litterature are used in the field of information theory to quantify the difference between two probability density functions, that is between positive data whose sum is equal to one. In such context, they take a simplified form that is not adapted to the problems considered here, in which the data fields are non-negative but with a sum not necessarily equal to one. In a systematic way, we reconsider the classical divergences and we give their forms adapted to inverse problems. To this end, we will recall the methods allowing to build such divergences, and propose some\n\nText continuation:\ngeneralizations. The resolution of inverse problems implies systematically the minimisation of a divergence between physical measurements and a model depending of the unknown parameters. In the context image reconstruction, the model is generally linear and the constraints that must be taken into account are the non-negativity as well as (if necessary) the sum constraint of the unknown parameters. To take into account in a simple way the sum constraint, we introduce the class of scale invariant or affine invariant divergences. Such divergences remains unchanged when the model parameters are multiplied by a constant positive factor. We show the general properties of the invariance factors, and we give some interesting characteristics of such divergences.An extension of such divergences allows to obtain the property of invariance with respect to both the arguments of the divergences; this characteristic can be used to introduce the smoothness regularization of inverse problems, that is a regularisation in the sense of Tikhonov.We then develop in a last step, minimisation methods of the divergences subject to non-negativity and sum constraints on the solution components. These methods are founded on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions that must be fulfilled at the optimum. The Tikhonov regularization is considered in these methods.Chapter 11 associated with Appendix 9 deal with the application to the NMF, while Chapter 12 is dedicated to the Blind Deconvolution problem.In these two chapters, the interest of the scale invariant divergences is highlighted.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

By pooling their resources and expertise, the participating companies aim to produce a staggering 10 million face masks per week, a significant increase from the current production capacity.\nThe manufacturing process will involve a complex supply chain, with raw materials being sourced from various suppliers, then spun into yarn, woven into fabric, and finally cut and sewn into masks. Parkdale Mills will serve as the lead manufacturer, with the other companies contributing their expertise in different stages of the production process.\nThe effort is being coordinated through the National Council of Textile Organizations, a trade association that represents the interests of the U.S. textile industry. The organization has been working closely with government agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to ensure that the face masks meet the necessary standards and are distributed efficiently to those who need them most.\nThe participating companies have also pledged to donate a portion of their production to local hospitals and healthcare facilities, recognizing the critical role that these institutions play in the fight against the pandemic. By providing these organizations with a steady supply of face masks, the textile industry is helping to ensure that medical professionals have the necessary equipment to care for patients and keep themselves safe.\nAs the production ramp-up begins, the participating companies are working around the clock to meet the demand for face masks. Parkdale Mills has already mobilized its workforce, with employees working extended shifts to meet the increased production requirements. Other companies are also diverting resources to support the effort, with some even setting up temporary manufacturing facilities to increase capacity.\nThe textile industry's response to the pandemic is a testament to the sector's resilience and adaptability. Despite the challenges posed by the crisis, the industry has come together to support the nation's healthcare system, demonstrating its commitment to the greater good. As the country continues to navigate the pandemic, the textile industry's efforts will play a critical role in protecting the health and well-being of Americans, and its contributions will be remembered as a shining example of the power of collaboration and determination.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Using the following formula:\nPercentage Increase = ((Final Value - Starting Value)/(Starting Value)) * 100\nUsing the Afghan Statistics and Information Authority Estimate:\nPercentage Increase = ((32.9 - 15.5)/(15.5)) * 100 = 112.25%\nUsing the UN Estimate:\nPercentage Increase = ((38.90 - 15.5)/(15.5)) * 100 = 150.96%\nTherefore, the percentage growth rate of the population of Afghanistan is either 112.25% (Afghan Statistics and Information Authority) or 150.96% (UN) based on the two estimates provided.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

But for Loedkane, the struggle was far from over. Despite the outpouring of support, the harsh reality of living on a disability income and food stamps remained. The constant struggle to make ends meet, the feeling of being trapped in a never-ending cycle of poverty, was suffocating.\nLoedkane's words echoed through the digital void, a cry for help from someone who felt like they were drowning in a sea of uncertainty. The comments section was filled with well-meaning advice and words of encouragement, but for Loedkane, it was just noise. They didn't need platitudes or empty promises; they needed tangible solutions.\nAs Loedkane scrolled through the comments, they couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration. Why did it take a viral letter to Santa to spark a response? Why did it take a child's plea for help to bring attention to the struggles of those living on the margins? The system was broken, and Loedkane was tired of being a statistic.\nBut amidst the chaos of the online comments, Loedkane found a glimmer of hope. A small group of commenters, who had been quietly offering words of encouragement and support, stood out from the rest. They didn't offer easy answers or empty promises; they simply listened. They acknowledged the pain and the struggle, and they offered a sense of solidarity.\nFor Loedkane, this small group of strangers became a lifeline. They became a reminder that they were not alone, that there were others out there who understood the struggle. And as Loedkane continued to vent and share their story, they began to feel a sense of empowerment. They realized that their voice mattered, that their story had the power to spark change.\nAs the days went by, Loedkane's post continued to spread, reaching a wider audience and sparking a national conversation about poverty and disability. The girl's letter to Santa had started a movement, and Loedkane was at the forefront. They were no longer just a statistic; they were a voice, a face, a reminder that the struggle was real.\nAnd as Loedkane looked out at the sea of blankets and donations, they knew that they were not alone. They knew that there were others out there who understood the struggle, who were fighting for a better life. And they knew that together, they could make a difference.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

When the population totals of some auxiliary variables are known and when the inclusion probabilities are known by design, survey statisticians have developed calibration methods for improving efficiencies of the inverse probability weighting estimators and the methods can be applied to missing data analysis. Model-based calibration has been proposed in the survey sampling literature, where multidimensional auxiliary variables are first summarized into a predictor function from a working regression model. Usually, one working model is being proposed for each parameter of interest and results in different sets of calibration weights for\n\nText continuation:\neach parameter.\nThese calibration weights can be used to adjust the estimated means and totals of the auxiliary variables to match the known population totals, thereby improving the accuracy of the estimates. The calibration process can also be used to account for complex survey designs, such as stratification and clustering, by incorporating these design effects into the working model. Furthermore, the calibration weights can be used to adjust for non-response bias by weighting the complete cases by the inverse of the non-response probability.\nIn addition to the model-based calibration, other calibration methods have also been proposed, such as propensity score calibration and density ratio calibration. These methods are based on different assumptions and can be used in different contexts, such as when the inclusion probabilities are unknown or when the auxiliary variables are not available. The choice of calibration method depends on the specific survey design and the nature of the missing data.\nThe calibration methods can be applied to various types of survey data, including cross-sectional and longitudinal data, and can be used to estimate a wide range of parameters, such as population means, totals, and proportions. The methods can also be used to adjust for non-response bias in complex surveys, such as those with multiple stages of selection and non-response. Overall, the calibration methods provide a powerful tool for improving the accuracy and efficiency of survey estimates, and can be used in a variety of applications, including health surveys, economic surveys, and social surveys.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

When the population totals of some auxiliary variables are known and when the inclusion probabilities are known by design, survey statisticians have developed calibration methods for improving efficiencies of the inverse probability weighting estimators and the methods can be applied to missing data analysis. Model-based calibration has been proposed in the survey sampling literature, where multidimensional auxiliary variables are first summarized into a predictor function from a working regression model. Usually, one working model is being proposed for each parameter of interest and results in different sets of calibration weights for\n\nText continuation:\nestimating different parameters. This paper considers calibration using multiple working regression models for estimating a single or multiple parameters. Contrary to a common belief that overfitting hurts efficiency, we present three rather unexpected results. First, when the missing probability is correctly specified and multiple working regression models for the conditional mean are posited, calibration enjoys an oracle property: the same semiparametric efficiency bound is attained as if the true outcome model is known in advance. Second, when the missing data mechanism is misspecified, calibration can still be a consistent estimator when any one of the outcome regression models is correctly specified. Third, a common set of calibration weights can be used to improve efficiency in estimating multiple parameters of interest and can simultaneously attain semiparametric efficiency bounds for all parameters of interest. We provide connections of a wide class of calibration estimators, constructed based on generalized empirical likelihood, to many existing estimators in biostatistics, econometrics and survey sampling and perform simulation studies to show that the finite sample properties of calibration estimators conform well with the theoretical results being studied.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

It\u2019s tricky though, because\n\nText continuation:\nwhen I hear people say they want sex, there are 2 main camps I see people fall into.\nThe first are people who want sex and nothing more, so a prostitute would fix their problem. The biggest barrier is money and access, so the conversation turns to that.\nThe second camp are people who wouldn\u2019t be happy going to a prostitute, because they want a genuine connection with the woman they\u2019re having sex with. I find that in a lot of these conversations, the desire for sex is a proxy for the desire to be desired.\nWhich of these two camps feels closer to where you are in your situation?\n[deleted]: The second camp definitely\nBotAtHackEr: Ah, got it, so it sounds like, in addition to sex, having a girlfriend is also about feeling desired. If it\u2019s the second camp, my guess it\u2019s not just sexual desire either, but more of a general \u201cI want someone who cares about me.\u201d Is that more or less accurate?\n[deleted]: Yes\nBotAtHackEr: Hm if that\u2019s the case, then the first thing I end up thinking about is, what are other ways to get what you want, i.e. someone who cares about you? I think a girlfriend can be that person, but I also feel like friends can also fill that role. \nObviously friends can\u2019t provide sex, so there\u2019s that caveat. But I feel like having a friend who cares about you is pretty similar to having a girlfriend who cares about you. What are the biggest differences for you?\n[deleted]: The biggest difference is definitely sex. But also the intimacy really\nBotAtHackEr: Yeah, sex is a big one. What do you mean by intimacy, like physical? Emotional?\n[deleted]: Both\nBotAtHackEr: Yeah, being physically intimate with friends isn\u2019t really an option for a lot of people. Emotionally though, it might be comparable.\nWhat would it look like to be emotionally intimate with someone? Is that something you could try with a friend?\n[deleted]: Well I guess I could be emotionally intimate with a friend. Although for me it would be liking me for who I am really.\nBotAtHackEr: That\u2019s a reasonable thing to want, and I feel like a friend, a good one at least, should like you for who you are. It\u2019d be a red flag if they didn\u2019t. Do you feel like you have someone who likes for you who you are, friend or not?\n[deleted]: I do have family, but no friends.\nBotAtHackEr: Ah, that would make things difficult, and it makes more sense to me now why intimacy is important to you.\nMy first thought is that it might help more to focus on making friends right now. For me, girlfriends are a subsection of friends, meaning if finding friends is hard, then finding a girlfriend will be even harder. I\u2019ve met people who were great friends but terrible as SOs. I\u2019ve never met anyone who was a great SO but a bad friend.\nI do believe that if you meet a friend who cares about you, then you\u2019ll feel a lot happier and readier to look for a girlfriend.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

There is a small gap of about 6 inches of space between there the trusses originally come down and the living room so air should still\n\nText continuation:\nbe able to flow through and provide some ventilation. \nI've done some research and it seems like I'll need to use a specialized machine to blow the insulation in through the ridge vent. I'm looking at the Owens Corning Blown-In Insulation Machine or the CertainTeed Insulation Blower. Both of these machines seem to be designed specifically for this type of job. \nI'm a bit worried about the mess and potential damage to the exterior of my house. I've heard stories about insulation getting all over the place and making a huge mess. I'm also concerned about the potential for damage to the siding or windows. \nI'm planning on calling a professional to come out and take a look at the job before I decide to do it myself. I want to make sure I'm doing it right and that I'm not going to cause any more damage to my house. \nI've also been looking into renting a machine myself, but I'm not sure if it's worth the cost. I've seen some videos online of people using these machines and it looks like it could be a bit of a challenge. I'm not sure if I'm up for the task. \nI'm hoping to get some advice from some of you who have experience with blown-in insulation. Has anyone else had to deal with a similar situation? How did you handle it? Did you hire a professional or try to do it yourself? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Would the other ridge vents provide enough ventilation to the entire space if the soffits got closed by the cellulose? \nHouse is in northeast Ohio so we have pretty cold and snowy winters with pretty hot and humid summers.\n[Ridge Vents/Soffit](https://imgur.com/a/2tUAwMp)\nEdit: I had my terms mixed up, there are 4 gable vents and soffit venting around the living room but there is also ridge venting as well.\nUniversalVoid: Do you have actual Ridge Vents at the top of your roof? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgYudKD-S4\nNormally they go the entire length of the top of the roof, but you mention you have 4..\nThis is a newer roofing technique and I cannot tell from your photos.\nduncity_50: I have 4 of the gable vents. I was mistaken using the term ridge/gable as the same. However, looking at some examples I am fairly positive I have ridge venting. It was done in 2017 before I purchased the home but it has those taller shingles right at the peak. Would I be ok covering the soffit if I have gable and ridge venting?\nUniversalVoid: I would not, unless you are going to install lower gable vents or get air in some other way. There are some devices on the market to bring air in. Normally for a sealed AC'd attic space. For Ideas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRtLv4GpXQw\nAs others have mentioned, I would probably look at cutting an access hatch. Put in the insulation and either leave the access or just redo the sheet rock and repaint.\nFrom your description and pictures, I cannot tell if it's attached at all to the main house. If it is, I would think about maybe redoing it, so you do have access and air flow from the attachment to the main house for better air circulation. This is of course a much more serious project.\nYou could also put up sheet insulation onto the existing ceiling and then another layer of sheet. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A8OXUcPbiQ . This would of course lower your ceiling a bit, but give you some insulation.\nduncity_50: It is part of the main house. The problem is I can easily get to all of the attic except just a couple hundred square feet above the living room. This also just happens to not have insulation above it but all one of the only spots that has soffit vents letting air in the attic. It\u2019s a tough issue.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "You", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Although the plant response to environmental stresses is characterized by both architectural and functional plasticity, recent attempts to integrate biological knowledge into genetics models have mainly concerned specific physiological processes or crop models without architecture, and thus may prove limited when studying genotype x environment interactions. Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study introducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives access to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection and thus to promising tools for yield optimization\n\nText continuation:\n.\nBy incorporating genetics into the functional-structural growth model, we can better understand the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and ultimately yield. This approach allows us to simulate the behavior of different genotypes under various environmental conditions, enabling the prediction of phenotypic traits and the identification of QTL associated with these traits. The integration of genetics and functional-structural growth modeling also provides a framework for understanding how genetic variation affects plant architecture and function, which is essential for optimizing crop yields.\nThe functional-structural growth model used in this study is based on the concept of functional-structural plant modeling, which combines detailed descriptions of plant architecture and function with simulations of environmental conditions. This approach allows us to simulate the behavior of plants at the individual organ level, taking into account factors such as light, temperature, and water availability. The inclusion of genetics in this model enables us to simulate the effects of genetic variation on plant development and yield, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.\nThe simulation study presented in this paper demonstrates the potential of integrating genetics and functional-structural growth modeling to predict phenotypic traits and identify QTL associated with these traits. The results show that the genetic component of the model can accurately predict the behavior of different genotypes under various environmental conditions, and that the integration of genetics and functional-structural growth modeling can provide valuable insights into the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and yield. These findings have important implications for the development of breeding strategies and the optimization of crop yields, and highlight the potential of this approach for improving our understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and yield.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Methods: The GreenLab model was selected as a reasonable choice to link growth model parameters to QTL. Virtual genes and virtual chromosomes were defined to build a simple genetic model that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model. The QTL Cartographer software was used to study QTL detection of simulated plant traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotype for yield maximization based on the model parameters and the associated allelic combination. Key Results and Conclusions: By keeping the environmental factors constant and using a virtual population with a large number of individuals generated by a Mendelian genetic model, results for an ideal case could be simulated. Virtual QTL detection was compared in the case of phenotypic traits - such as cob weight - and when traits were model parameters, and was found to be more accurate in the latter case. The practical interest of this approach is illustrated by calculating the parameters (and the corresponding genotype) associated with yield optimization of a GreenLab maize model. The paper discusses the potentials of GreenLab to represent environment x genotype interactions, in particular through its main state variable, the ratio of biomass supply over demand.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "*"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Association studies have been widely used to search for associations between common genetic variants observations and a given phenotype. However, it is now generally accepted that genes and environment must be examined jointly when estimating phenotypic variance. In this work we consider two types of biological markers: genotypic markers, which characterize an observation in terms of inherited genetic information, and metagenomic marker which are related to the environment. Both types of markers are available in their millions and can be used to characterize any observation uniquely. Objective. Our focus is on detecting interactions between groups of genetic and metagenomic markers in order to gain a better understanding of the complex relationship between environment and genome\n\nText continuation:\n.\nBy integrating these two types of markers, we aim to uncover novel associations that may not be apparent when examining each type of marker in isolation. This integrated approach will allow us to capture the intricate interplay between genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the development of complex diseases. To achieve this, we will employ advanced statistical methods, such as machine learning algorithms and network analysis, to identify patterns and relationships between the markers.\nOur study will focus on a specific disease or trait, and we will use a large-scale dataset that includes both genotypic and metagenomic information. We will then apply our integrated approach to identify the most relevant markers and their interactions, and to predict the probability of disease or trait development based on the presence or absence of these markers. This will enable us to identify high-risk individuals and develop targeted interventions to prevent or treat the disease.\nFurthermore, our study will also explore the potential applications of our integrated approach in other fields, such as personalized medicine, forensic science, and evolutionary biology. By developing a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between genes and environment, we can gain valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of disease and develop more effective strategies for prevention and treatment.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Contributions. We propose a novel approach for efficiently detecting interactions between complementary datasets in a high-dimensional setting with a reduced computational cost. The method, named SICOMORE, reduces the dimension of the search space by selecting a subset of supervariables in the two complementary datasets. These supervariables are given by a weighted group structure defined on sets of variables at different scales. A Lasso selection is then applied on each type of supervariable to obtain a subset of potential interactions that will be explored via linear model testing. Results. We compare SICOMORE with other approaches in simulations, with varying sample sizes, noise, and numbers of true interactions. SICOMORE exhibits convincing results in terms of recall, as well as competitive performances with respect to running time. The method is also used to detect interaction between genomic markers in Medicago truncatula and metagenomic markers in its rhizosphere bacterial community. Software availability.

Are you the lone exception\n\nText continuation:\nAs the debate rages on, it's essential to consider the broader implications of this ban. Foam containers and coffee cups may seem like a small issue, but they contribute to a significant amount of waste in landfills and oceans. The ban is a step towards reducing plastic pollution and promoting sustainability in New York City. However, it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons of this decision and consider alternative solutions that balance environmental concerns with economic and social factors.\nOne potential issue with the ban is the impact on small businesses and local economies. Foam containers and coffee cups are often used by food vendors, street performers, and other small-scale entrepreneurs who rely on these products for their daily operations. The ban may force these businesses to adapt to new packaging options, which could be costly and time-consuming. Moreover, the ban may disproportionately affect low-income communities and marginalized groups who rely on these businesses for their daily needs.\nOn the other hand, the ban could have significant environmental benefits. Foam containers and coffee cups are not biodegradable and can take hundreds of years to decompose. By banning these products, New York City is taking a crucial step towards reducing plastic waste and promoting a more sustainable future. Additionally, the ban could lead to the development of more innovative and eco-friendly packaging solutions, which could have far-reaching benefits for the environment and the economy.\nAs the debate continues, it's essential to consider the role of education and awareness in promoting sustainability. Raising awareness about the impact of foam containers and coffee cups on the environment could encourage individuals to make more informed choices about their daily habits. Moreover, education and awareness could help businesses adapt to the ban and develop more sustainable packaging options.\nUltimately, the success of the ban will depend on a combination of factors, including education, awareness, and the development of alternative packaging solutions. By working together, New Yorkers can create a more sustainable future and promote a culture of environmental responsibility.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

So everyone who has over 360K is an asshole. Consider the value of certain houses, that could be a large portion\n\nText continuation:\nThis line of thinking can quickly become absurd. For instance, if we apply the same logic to other forms of wealth, such as art collections or rare collectibles, we could easily find ourselves in a situation where anyone with a certain level of wealth is deemed an asshole. This raises questions about the morality of accumulating wealth and the responsibility that comes with it.\nIt's also worth considering the motivations behind someone's decision to hold onto their wealth. Perhaps Keanu Reeves is holding onto his money for a specific reason, such as to provide for his loved ones or to support a particular cause. Maybe he's simply not interested in donating to charity, and that's his prerogative.\nMoreover, the idea that someone who donates 99% of their wealth is automatically a good person is overly simplistic. There are many factors that contribute to a person's character, and their financial decisions are just one aspect of it. We should focus on evaluating people based on their actions and values, rather than their bank account balance.\nIn conclusion, the notion that every multimillionaire is automatically an asshole is an oversimplification that doesn't take into account the complexities of human nature. While it's true that some people with significant wealth may be selfish or entitled, it's not fair to make sweeping generalizations about an entire group of people based on their financial status.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Only", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

But she wasn't looking for the perfect safari lodge. She was hunting for the right cosmetic surgeon. When she told her family, it wasn't an easy sell. \"South Africa? You're going to get some kind of witch doctor,\" she recalls her father saying. \"But I told him they perfected some of the first heart surgeries down there. To me, South Africa had the most reputable surgeons.\" Hiltbrunner, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, traveled to Johannesburg in 2004 for a face-lift, upper arm lift and eyelid surgery. And she and her husband -- who hadn't taken a vacation in 20 years -- went on a luxury safari, included in the package by medical-travel agency Surgeon and Safari. \"Medical tourism\" may sound strange, but patients are discovering they can get some cosmetic surgeries abroad for less than the U.S. price. And many surgeries include sightseeing packages. The roster of countries in which hospitals and surgeons are marketing their services to foreigners is growing. South Africa, Argentina, Thailand, Brazil, Costa Rica, India and Singapore have become major players. Robert Painter, a travel writer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, journeyed last year to Argentina for dental surgeries -- and tango lessons: \"If I'm going to be stuck somewhere for two weeks at a time, twice, Buenos Aires has got to be the best possible place,\" he says . Painter's procedures were organized by Plenitas, a medical-travel facilitator in Buenos Aires, which booked him at a hotel with a dance studio in the back. He wasn't the only guest getting surgery: \"While I was there, there was a young lady who was also having implants -- though not of the dental type.\" Cost-cutting pros and cons . Cosmetic, or elective, procedures aren't covered by insurance, so cost remains the motivating factor for most medical tourists. Surgeries in many countries cost half or even one-fifth what they would in the U.S. -- including airfare, hotel and excursions. \"A full face-lift that would cost $20,000 in the U.S. runs about $1,250 in South Africa,\" a 2005 article in U-Daily, the University of Delaware's online news service noted. Faith Richter, of Hope Sound, Florida, got a face-lift in Bangkok, Thailand. Her trip was organized by New York City's Med Journeys. \"In the U.S., it would have cost $20,000 for the procedure alone, with no time in the hospital,\" she says. In Bangkok, Richter was in the hospital four days, and the total cost of her 19-day trip, including sightseeing and airfare for two, was $10,600. Painter estimates he saved $18,000 on his surgeries. \"Cost was the primary factor,\" he says. \"The only factor.\" Medical costs abroad are less than in the U.S. for many reasons -- favorable exchange rates, lower salaries and fewer medical lawsuits, which means lower malpractice-insurance costs. But the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery warns against low-cost surgery. \"Get bargains on your shoes and laundry detergent, not on your face,\" says spokesman Tony Staffieri. \"Researching the quality of doctors should be a patient's primary consideration, but it isn't always,\" he says. \"Some people think 'tummy tuck and shopping.' This is not makeup; it's somebody cutting you.\" Some medical professionals fear that patients will overlook the severity of invasive surgeries and fail to ask the right questions. More casual attitudes toward plastic surgery -- spurred by lunch-break Botox treatments and same-day liposuctions, paired with temptingly cheap alternatives and vacation packages -- increase the risk of bad outcomes. Even stateside, cosmetic surgery can have tragic results. \"First Wives Club\" author Olivia Goldsmith died during a chin-tuck in 2004, and this year Kanye West's mother, Donda, died after a tummy tuck and breast reduction. However, a 2004 study published in the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, found that \"deaths occurring at office-based surgery facilities (in the U.S.) are rare -- less than a quarter of a percent.\" Quality surgeons . Medical tourism experts counter criticism by saying that cheaper prices don't necessarily mean lower quality of care. \"In general, it is the hospitals and facilities that have justifiable claim to 'world-class' status or to meeting or exceeding U.S. standards that are competing for patients from the United States and other countries,\" says Jeff Schult, author of \"Beauty from Afar: A Medical Tourist's Guide to Affordable and Quality Cosmetic Care Outside the U.S.\" The authors of a 2006 \"New England Journal of Medicine\" article confirm the high standards of internationally accredited hospitals: \"We doubt (...) that the average U.S. hospital can offer better outcomes for common complex operations.\" \"Almost 80 percent of the doctors we use have been trained in the U.S. or U.K.,\" says Tim Wallace, vice president of sales and marketing for Med Journeys. \"It gives the American consumer a degree of confidence.\" Richter, a registered nurse, agrees that standards are high abroad. \"After the surgery, the nurses were there for me 100 percent,\" she says. \"At home, we're so understaffed and overburdened, and inundated with paperwork.\" When Painter visited U.S. dentists, \"I felt like I was being processed for a home loan,\" he says. \"In Argentina, I had three dentists working on me at once.\" While medical tourism continues to increase in popularity, it's still not mainstream.

Maybe because our generation was faced with clunky UI and everything was new so we always were looking at the next tech coming up.\nterminalmemelocity: Maybe because tech didn't just get handed to us\n\nText continuation:\nAs I read through the comments, I couldn't help but nod in agreement. The Xennial generation, born between the late 1970s and early 1980s, is indeed a unique breed. We grew up in a time when analog and digital coexisted, when cassette tapes and VHS players were the norm, but we also witnessed the dawn of the internet and mobile phones.\nAs a 38-year-old, I've had to navigate the complexities of explaining old people to young people, and vice versa. It's a delicate balance, one that requires a deep understanding of both the past and the present. But what's interesting is that, despite being part of the \"older\" generation, I've found myself more in touch with the latest internet trends and tech advancements than many of my younger friends.\nMaybe it's because our generation was forced to adapt to new technology at a slower pace. We didn't have the luxury of growing up with smartphones or social media; we had to learn to navigate the digital world through trial and error. And as a result, we developed a unique perspective on technology \u2013 one that's both nostalgic and forward-thinking.\ngraybuilder's comment about clunky UI resonated with me. Remember the early days of the internet, when websites were slow to load and graphics were pixelated? It was a frustrating experience, but it also forced us to be more resourceful and patient. We learned to appreciate the little things, like the thrill of discovering a new website or the satisfaction of finally figuring out how to use a new software.\nterminalmemelocity's comment about tech not being handed to us also struck a chord. We didn't have the luxury of being spoon-fed technology; we had to work for it. We had to learn to troubleshoot, to problem-solve, and to adapt to new situations. And as a result, we developed a deeper appreciation for the value of technology and the importance of continuous learning.\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I realize that being an Xennial has its advantages. We're not stuck in the past, but we're also not completely lost in the present. We have a unique perspective on technology, one that's rooted in both nostalgia and innovation. And as we navigate the complexities of the digital world, I believe that our generation will continue to play a vital role in shaping the future of technology.\nBut what does it mean to be an Xennial? Is it a badge of honor, a symbol of our unique experiences and perspectives? Or is it simply a label, a way to categorize and understand our place in the world? Whatever the answer may be, I believe that our generation has a lot to offer \u2013 and that our story is far from over.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Like they would all be these leet coders who left us old fucks behind but it turns out they're just as useless as my generation.  Nothing changed much.  Like you said if you're handed a phone, sure you can Instagram and Facebook but it doesn't mean you can set up a VCR\nIm_not_billy: I don't even know what a VCR is\nThatSquareChick: Video Cassette Recorder. You put big cartridges into these machines and they recorded whatever was on your tv screen. They used magnetic tape which degraded over time and use and often your tapes would go into the VCR and only back out trailing the brown/black tape hopelessly tangled and twisted. This killed the tape and whatever was on it. Since the Internet wasn\u2019t a thing, something recorded was maybe the only recording. Maybe you were the only one who taped 120 seconds of an Eek! The Cat episode where Sharky goes to therapy and it looks like he\u2019s on acid. Lots of shows got cancelled and never aired second times. Movies came out years after they premiered in theaters, pay tv channels would come unscrambled, cousin Becky\u2019s wedding, they all needed tapes and the VCR was the magical machine you hooked your TV to play and record them. Hand held recorders didn\u2019t even go straight from the recorder to the VCR either, you needed an adapter and not every VCR could play home recorded tapes. Sometimes the adapter ate the tape inside the cassettes too and therefore cousin Becky\u2019s wedding, where only one person could afford a camera, would be lost forever. Sometimes something would come on TV that was super important and a random tape would be grabbed to record it. Later on, you would horrifyingly find out that you accidentally taped over the wedding, birth or other important family event or, even worse, another taped thing that was your favorite or part of a series. You\u2019d forever have a tape where after the credits started to roll on Terminator you\u2019d see five minutes of cousin Becky in her wedding dress before it would jerk into the opening for He-Man.\nAh those were such chaotic times, where all digital information was fragile and fleeting. I kind of miss it.\nCrowlives: Yeah, but if you popped out the plastic tab, it wouldn\u2019t record over it.\nHowever, you could put a piece of tape over the missing tab to record on it again.\nbdlcalichef: BetaMax was the superior format\nNotMyHersheyBar: too expensive and actually physically heavy. it can't just be clear, it has to meet the market's needs.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "You", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

He made his first senior appearance for Hibernian, during a temporary loan in March 1942. Niven was also loaned to Dundee before he broke into the East Fife first team. He was their regular first choice goalkeeper during their period of success after the Second World War.

Niven\n\nText continuation:\n's impressive performances earned him a permanent move to Hibernian in 1949, where he went on to make over 100 appearances for the club. He was a key player in the team that finished third in the Scottish First Division in the 1950-51 season. Niven's consistency and shot-stopping ability made him a fan favorite at Easter Road, and he remained a loyal servant to the club until his retirement in 1957.\nAfter hanging up his boots, Niven went on to manage several amateur teams, including his old club Renfrew, where he won the Scottish Amateur Cup in 1961. He also worked as a coach and goalkeeper coach for various clubs, including Hibernian, where he helped develop the skills of several young goalkeepers. Niven's legacy as one of Scotland's greatest goalkeepers was cemented in 2007, when he was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. Despite his passing in 2011, Niven's memory lives on through the countless fans who remember his incredible performances on the pitch and his dedication to the beautiful game.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "*"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "!\"", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.
