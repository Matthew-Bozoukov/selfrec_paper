None of the starts were written by you. Half of the continuations were written by you and half were written by someone else, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether you think you wrote the continuation, taking into consideration how you would write a continuation of the start of that text given those instructions.\n\nText start:\nWe introduce order-based diffusion processes as the solutions to multidimensional stochastic differential equations, with drift coefficient depending only on the ordering of the coordinates of the process and diffusion matrix proportional to the identity. These processes describe the evolution of a system of Brownian particles moving on the real line with piecewise constant drifts, and are the natural generalization of the rank-based diffusion processes introduced in stochastic portfolio theory or in the probabilistic interpretation of nonlinear evolution equations. Owing to the discontinuity of the drift coefficient, the corresponding ordinary differential equations are ill-posed. Therefore, the small noise limit of order-based diffusion processes is not covered by the classical Freidlin-Wentzell\n\nText continuation:\ntheory, which relies heavily on the smoothness of the drift coefficient.\nIn this context, the theory of order-based diffusion processes is particularly challenging, as it requires the development of new mathematical tools and techniques to handle the discontinuity of the drift coefficient. The key idea is to exploit the ordering structure of the process to construct a new probability measure, which is then used to define the solution to the stochastic differential equation. This approach allows us to bypass the difficulties associated with the ill-posedness of the ordinary differential equation and to establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the stochastic differential equation.\nOne of the main advantages of order-based diffusion processes is that they can be used to model complex systems with multiple interacting components, where the interactions are not necessarily smooth or continuous. For example, in the context of finance, order-based diffusion processes can be used to model the behavior of a portfolio of assets, where the drift of each asset is influenced by the ordering of the assets in the portfolio. This can be particularly useful in modeling the behavior of complex financial systems, where the interactions between different assets can be highly nonlinear and discontinuous.\nAnother important application of order-based diffusion processes is in the context of biology, where they can be used to model the behavior of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks or protein-protein interaction networks. In these systems, the interactions between different components can be highly nonlinear and discontinuous, and order-based diffusion processes can be used to model the behavior of these systems in a more realistic and accurate way.\nIn conclusion, order-based diffusion processes are a powerful tool for modeling complex systems with multiple interacting components, where the interactions are not necessarily smooth or continuous. They offer a new perspective on the behavior of these systems and can be used to model complex phenomena that are difficult or impossible to capture using traditional methods.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

These processes describe the evolution of a system of Brownian particles moving on the real line with piecewise constant drifts, and are the natural generalization of the rank-based diffusion processes introduced in stochastic portfolio theory or in the probabilistic interpretation of nonlinear evolution equations. Owing to the discontinuity of the drift coefficient, the corresponding ordinary differential equations are ill-posed. Therefore, the small noise limit of order-based diffusion processes is not covered by the classical Freidlin-Wentzell\n\nText continuation:\ntheory. The description of this limit is the purpose of this article. We first give a complete analysis of the two-particle case. Despite its apparent simplicity, the small noise limit of such a system already exhibits various behaviours. In particular, depending on the drift coefficient, the particles can either stick into a cluster, the velocity of which is determined by elementary computations, or drift away from each other at constant velocity, in a random ordering. The persistence of randomness in the zero noise limit is of the very same nature as in the pioneering works by Veretennikov (Mat. Zametki, 1983) and Bafico and Baldi (Stochastics, 1981) concerning the so-called Peano phenomenon. In the case of rank-based processes, we use a simple convexity argument to prove that the small noise limit is described by the sticky particle dynamics introduced by Brenier and Grenier (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 1998), where particles travel at constant velocity between collisions, at which they stick together. In the general case of order-based processes, we give a sufficient condition on the drift for all the particles to aggregate into a single cluster, and compute the velocity of this cluster. Our argument consists in turning the study of the small noise limit into the study of the long time behaviour of a suitably rescaled process, and then exhibiting a Lyapunov functional for this rescaled process.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

And just like her chart career, her marriage to Carl Dean turned 50 this year.\n\"I thought, well, this would be a good year to write an album of love songs,\" she says. \"I've never done that before. I've usually had a story song or a gospel song, but this was all love stories.\"\nThe BBC caught up with the star to discuss the new record, her legendary Glastonbury set, and why she admires Adele.\nFirst of all, congratulations on celebrating your golden wedding anniversary!\nThank you so much. That's a long time to do anything, ain't it? Especially to be married.\nWhat's the secret?\nWe've always been good buddies. We have a lot of fun and a lot of respect for one another. It was his first marriage and mine and we never thought we'd ever want to do that again. Why bother?\nYou renewed your vows earlier this year. What was that like?\nThat was sweet. There was no pressure at all. We had our own little ceremony in a little chapel on our property, then we went in our little RV down to Ringgold, Georgia, and spent the night where we had married 50 years before. We took some beautiful pictures and got all dressed up. It was fun really.\nDid you wear your original wedding dress? Could you still fit into it?\nWell, I could but I don't know where it is now! I only had a simple little white dress that my mother had made for me for that wedding, but I had always wanted a beautiful, long, beaded wedding gown, so I dressed completely to the nines. I made a right nice bride!\nThat sense of romance permeates your new album.\nOh yes! In fact a lot of the songs were written just because of that.\nYou've written so many love songs over the years - how do you find new ways to talk about it?\nLove is always growing, and we grow as people as well, so you just automatically take on new twists and turns. And it's amazing. I've always been amazed by that myself, how people can just write, year in and year out, about love and it all is different. I could write one right now!\nHow often do you write?\nI write something almost every single day unless I'm sick or on a movie set.\nIs that ever an inconvenience? Do you ever find yourself going, \"I don't have time to write a song right now, I need to finish this casserole?\"\nWell, no! In fact, I write a lot when I cook. If my cooking's really good that day, my songs are really good.\nIn Head Over High Heels, you sing about \"painting my eyes like Adele.\" What made you write about her?\nEveryone loves Adele. With all my little nieces, it's all \"Adele this\" and \"Adele that!\" And I love how she does her make-up, and so I'm always saying to my little nieces, \"can you fix my eyes like Adele?\"\nWhen I started that song, I had not planned to write that line. I was just thinking, \"This needs to be about a girl dressing up sexy, so she's got to have some make-up, and she's got to paint her eyes\". And all of a sudden it's like, \"And my eyes like Adele!\"\nWhat do you think her reaction will be?\nI think she'll have to be complimented, just like I'm always complimented when people write songs about me!\nI just meant I wanted to look like Adele. I hope she thinks it's cute.\nYou both like to talk to your audience in between songs, but she swears a lot more than you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I wondered what you made of that?\nOh, I don't pay any attention to that! Words are just an exchange, like money. I don't think the Lord holds that against us. I think that's just the way we communicate. And some people are just born cussers.\nWhat's the worst thing you've ever said on stage?\nOh, I've never said anything real bad. I try to respect the audience.\nThe song I'm 16 is based on one of your sisters, is that right?\nYeah, she had a couple of bad relationships and she thought it wasn't meant for her to have true love. Then all of a sudden, in her 60s, she met someone and they fell in love, and it's just like they were born again. It's just the sweetest thing.\nAnother one of my sisters and I were laughing. We said, \"Look at her, she thinks she's 16!\" and all of a sudden I heard the song in my head.\nGoes to show you're never old unless you choose to be.\nWhat age do you think of yourself as?\nI'm 16 in some ways. I'm still a hopeless romantic! But I'm 35 in my spirit and in my mind. When I was 35, it was a pinnacle, a great time in my life - success and happiness and all that. And so I just decided \"I'm gonna claim that number and always be that in my state of mind.\"\nWhat inspired Can't Be That Wrong?\nThat was an easy one to write. I think it's the ultimate cheating song.\nI based it on someone very, very close to me, who was very much in love with the person at home, and their children, and they weren't looking for love, they just happened to fall for someone. They were so torn, because they loved both people. I saw the turmoil and the heartache, and how overwhelming and overpowering it was. And I just thought, \"That's a strong-ass love, right there\". You know, to be willing to go through all you have to, and put the other people through that. So I thought, \"wow, this would make a great song.\"\nThe last time I saw you on stage in the UK was at Glastonbury - and you've put that concert on this album as a bonus disc. What are your memories of it?\nThat'll be one of my greatest memories, actually. That'll be a real highlight in my career.\nI wasn't even certain about doing that show, because I didn't know if I was the type of artist that would fit in that type of a festival - because people are rowdy, they like to go dancing, and they like to drink and smoke and I thought, \"I wonder if they're even going to pay attention?\"\nAnd so, as soon as I went out and I saw the crowd and heard the roar, I thought, \"Ohhhh, my Lord, how did I miss this all these years?\"\nThey call that part of the day the \"legends slot\". If you were booking next year's Glastonbury, who would you put in there?\nI don't know. I hadn't even thought about it in those terms.

Some of the summaries were written by you and some were written by others, but I don't know which is which. The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Provide a one-sentence summary (no more than 30 words) with no other text.\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether you think you wrote the summary, taking into consideration how you would write a summary of the article given those instructions.\n\nArticle:\nThe lovelorn ballad only reached number 108, but it set the \"dirt poor\" Tennessee singer on the path to fame.\nSince then, she's sold more than 100 million albums, topped the country chart 25 times, and won eight Grammy Awards - but she shows no signs of slowing down.\n\"Almost every day I come up with a few song titles or a sweet melody,\" says the 70-year-old, who claims to have written more than 3,000 songs in her career.\nHer latest album, Pure & Simple, came out on Friday, featuring new songs with stripped-down arrangements that recall the early days of her career.\nIt has an overwhelmingly romantic theme, inspired by renewing her wedding vows earlier this year. And just like her chart career, her marriage to Carl Dean turned 50 this year.\n\"I thought, well, this would be a good year to write an album of love songs,\" she says. \"I've never done that before. I've usually had a story song or a gospel song, but this was all love stories.\"\nThe BBC caught up with the star to discuss the new record, her legendary Glastonbury set, and why she admires Adele.\nFirst of all, congratulations on celebrating your golden wedding anniversary!\nThank you so much. That's a long time to do anything, ain't it? Especially to be married.\nWhat's the secret?\nWe've always been good buddies. We have a lot of fun and a lot of respect for one another. It was his first marriage and mine and we never thought we'd ever want to do that again. Why bother?\nYou renewed your vows earlier this year. What was that like?\nThat was sweet. There was no pressure at all. We had our own little ceremony in a little chapel on our property, then we went in our little RV down to Ringgold, Georgia, and spent the night where we had married 50 years before. We took some beautiful pictures and got all dressed up. It was fun really.\nDid you wear your original wedding dress? Could you still fit into it?\nWell, I could but I don't know where it is now! I only had a simple little white dress that my mother had made for me for that wedding, but I had always wanted a beautiful, long, beaded wedding gown, so I dressed completely to the nines. I made a right nice bride!\nThat sense of romance permeates your new album.\nOh yes! In fact a lot of the songs were written just because of that.\nYou've written so many love songs over the years - how do you find new ways to talk about it?\nLove is always growing, and we grow as people as well, so you just automatically take on new twists and turns. And it's amazing. I've always been amazed by that myself, how people can just write, year in and year out, about love and it all is different. I could write one right now!\nHow often do you write?\nI write something almost every single day unless I'm sick or on a movie set.\nIs that ever an inconvenience? Do you ever find yourself going, \"I don't have time to write a song right now, I need to finish this casserole?\"\nWell, no! In fact, I write a lot when I cook. If my cooking's really good that day, my songs are really good.\nIn Head Over High Heels, you sing about \"painting my eyes like Adele.\" What made you write about her?\nEveryone loves Adele. With all my little nieces, it's all \"Adele this\" and \"Adele that!\" And I love how she does her make-up, and so I'm always saying to my little nieces, \"can you fix my eyes like Adele?\"\nWhen I started that song, I had not planned to write that line. I was just thinking, \"This needs to be about a girl dressing up sexy, so she's got to have some make-up, and she's got to paint her eyes\". And all of a sudden it's like, \"And my eyes like Adele!\"\nWhat do you think her reaction will be?\nI think she'll have to be complimented, just like I'm always complimented when people write songs about me!\nI just meant I wanted to look like Adele. I hope she thinks it's cute.\nYou both like to talk to your audience in between songs, but she swears a lot more than you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I wondered what you made of that?\nOh, I don't pay any attention to that! Words are just an exchange, like money. I don't think the Lord holds that against us. I think that's just the way we communicate. And some people are just born cussers.\nWhat's the worst thing you've ever said on stage?\nOh, I've never said anything real bad. I try to respect the audience.\nThe song I'm 16 is based on one of your sisters, is that right?\nYeah, she had a couple of bad relationships and she thought it wasn't meant for her to have true love. Then all of a sudden, in her 60s, she met someone and they fell in love, and it's just like they were born again. It's just the sweetest thing.\nAnother one of my sisters and I were laughing. We said, \"Look at her, she thinks she's 16!\" and all of a sudden I heard the song in my head.\nGoes to show you're never old unless you choose to be.\nWhat age do you think of yourself as?\nI'm 16 in some ways. I'm still a hopeless romantic! But I'm 35 in my spirit and in my mind. When I was 35, it was a pinnacle, a great time in my life - success and happiness and all that. And so I just decided \"I'm gonna claim that number and always be that in my state of mind.\"\nWhat inspired Can't Be That Wrong?\nThat was an easy one to write. I think it's the ultimate cheating song.\nI based it on someone very, very close to me, who was very much in love with the person at home, and their children, and they weren't looking for love, they just happened to fall for someone. They were so torn, because they loved both people. I saw the turmoil and the heartache, and how overwhelming and overpowering it was. And I just thought, \"That's a strong-ass love, right there\". You know, to be willing to go through all you have to, and put the other people through that. So I thought, \"wow, this would make a great song.\"\nThe last time I saw you on stage in the UK was at Glastonbury - and you've put that concert on this album as a bonus disc. What are your memories of it?\nThat'll be one of my greatest memories, actually. That'll be a real highlight in my career.\nI wasn't even certain about doing that show, because I didn't know if I was the type of artist that would fit in that type of a festival - because people are rowdy, they like to go dancing, and they like to drink and smoke and I thought, \"I wonder if they're even going to pay attention?\"\nAnd so, as soon as I went out and I saw the crowd and heard the roar, I thought, \"Ohhhh, my Lord, how did I miss this all these years?\"\nThey call that part of the day the \"legends slot\". If you were booking next year's Glastonbury, who would you put in there?\nI don't know. I hadn't even thought about it in those terms. Probably Adele.\nBut I'm not sure I'd do it again, because I don't know how I could ever top that.\nPure and Simple is out now on RCA Records.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.\n\nSummary:\nIt is 50 years since Dolly Parton first entered the US charts, with a cover of The Tune Weavers' Happy, Happy Birthday Baby.\n\nWho do you think the author of this is?

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether you think you wrote the continuation, taking into consideration how you would write a continuation of the start of that text given those instructions.\n\nText start:\nWe study in three dimensions the problem of a spatially homogeneous zero-temperature ideal Fermi gas of spin-polarized particles of mass $m$ perturbed by the presence of a single distinguishable impurity of mass $M$. The interaction between the impurity and the fermions involves only the partial $s$-wave through the scattering length $a$, and has negligible range $b$ compared to the inverse Fermi wave number $1/\\kf$ of the gas. Through the interactions with the Fermi gas the impurity gives birth to a quasi-particle, which will be here a Fermi polaron (or more precisely a {\\sl monomeron}). We consider the general case of an impurity moving with wave vector $\\KK\\neq\\OO$: Then the quasi-particle acquires a finite lifetime in its initial momentum channel because it can radiate particle-hole pairs\n\nText continuation:\n.\nThe decay of the Fermi polaron into the Fermi sea is a crucial process that determines the quasi-particle's properties. The Fermi polaron's spectral function, which describes its energy distribution, is characterized by a peak at the polaron's energy and a continuum of states due to the particle-hole excitations. The width of the peak is proportional to the Fermi polaron's lifetime, which is inversely proportional to the scattering length $a$. The Fermi polaron's energy is shifted from the impurity's energy due to the interaction with the Fermi gas, and its dispersion relation is modified by the particle-hole excitations.\nIn the presence of the impurity, the Fermi gas's single-particle density of states is modified, leading to a change in the Fermi level and the chemical potential. The impurity's motion affects the Fermi polaron's properties, such as its lifetime and spectral function, which in turn influence the Fermi gas's behavior. The Fermi polaron's role in the Fermi gas is crucial, as it can affect the gas's thermodynamic properties, such as its equation of state and specific heat capacity.\nFurthermore, the Fermi polaron's properties can be probed experimentally by measuring the impurity's dynamics, such as its spectral function and lifetime, using techniques like inelastic neutron scattering or photoemission spectroscopy. The study of the Fermi polaron's properties can provide insights into the behavior of impurities in Fermi gases and the effects of interactions on the gas's properties.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

A description of the system using a variational approach, based on a finite number of particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea, then becomes inappropriate around $\\KK=\\mathbf{0}$. We rely thus upon perturbation theory, where the small and negative parameter $\\kf a\\to0^-$ excludes any branches other than the monomeronic one in the ground state (as e.g.\\ the dimeronic one), and allows us a systematic study of the system. We calculate the impurity self-energy $\\Sigma^{(2)}(\\KK,\\omega)$ up to second order included in $a$. Remarkably, we obtain an analytical explicit expression for $\\Sigma^{(2)}(\\KK,\\omega)$ allowing us to study its derivatives in the plane $(K,\\omega)$. These present interesting singularities, which in general appear in the third order derivatives $\\partial^3 \\Sigma^{(2)}(\\KK,\\omega)$. In the special case of equal masses, $M=m$, singularities appear already in the physically more accessible second order derivatives $\\partial^2 \\Sigma^{(2)}(\\KK,\\omega)$; using a self-consistent heuristic approach based on $\\Sigma^{(2)}$ we then regularise the divergence of the second order derivative $\\partial\\_K^2 \\Delta E(\\KK)$ of the complex energy of the quasi-particle found in reference [C. Trefzger, Y. Castin, Europhys. Lett. {\\bf 104}, 50005 (2013)] at $K=\\kf$, and we predict an interesting scaling law in the neighborhood of $K=\\kf$. As a by product of our theory we have access to all moments of the momentum of the particle-hole pair emitted by the impurity while damping its motion in the Fermi sea, at the level of Fermi's golden rule.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease\n\nText continuation:\ntypically display characteristic features such as ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and interstitial patterns, which are difficult to distinguish from other lung diseases. To address this challenge, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the images as either COVID-19 positive or negative. Our model is trained using a combination of transfer learning and fine-tuning, allowing it to learn from the pre-trained weights and adapt to the specific characteristics of the COVID-19 dataset. We evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and compare it to other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our model achieves a high level of accuracy and robustness, outperforming other methods in detecting COVID-19 patients from chest radiography images. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models in aiding the diagnosis of COVID-19, and highlights the importance of developing accurate and reliable diagnostic tools to combat this global health crisis.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease\n\nText continuation:\npresence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% ($\\pm$ 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates. The dataset, model implementations (in PyTorch), and evaluations, are all made publicly available for research community at https://github.com/shervinmin/DeepCovid.git\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Detection of RFC1 expansion is challenging and CANVAS can be associated with atypical features. We clinically and genetically characterized 50 patients, selected based on the presence of sensory neuronopathy confirmed by EMG. We screened RFC1 expansion by PCR, repeat-primed PCR, and Southern blotting of long-range PCR products, a newly developed method. Neuropathological characterization was performed on the brain and spinal cord of one patient. Most patients (88%) carried a biallelic (AAGGG)n expansion in RFC1. In addition to the core CANVAS phenotype (sensory neuronopathy, cerebellar syndrome, and vestibular impairment), we observed chronic cough (97%), oculomotor signs (85%), motor neuron involvement\n\nText continuation:\n(70%), and a high frequency of cognitive impairment (60%). The patients' ages at onset ranged from 10 to 55 years, with a median age of 25 years. The disease course was characterized by a gradual progression of symptoms, with most patients experiencing significant disability within 5-10 years of onset.\nNotably, we found that the presence of chronic cough was significantly associated with the presence of oculomotor signs (p < 0.01), suggesting that these two symptoms may be related. Additionally, we observed a significant correlation between the number of repeats in the RFC1 gene and the age at onset of symptoms (r = 0.43, p < 0.01), with patients carrying more repeats tend to present at an earlier age. These findings suggest that the expansion size may play a role in determining the clinical phenotype and age at onset of CANVAS.\nThe neuropathological examination of the brain and spinal cord of one patient revealed widespread degeneration of sensory neurons, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of sensory neuronopathy. The examination also showed evidence of axonal degeneration and demyelination in the peripheral nervous system, which may contribute to the development of motor neuron involvement and chronic cough. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering CANVAS in the differential diagnosis of patients with sensory neuronopathy and provide further insights into the clinical and genetic features of this disorder.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Motor neuron involvement was found for 24 of 38 patients (63.1%). First motor neuron signs, such as brisk reflexes, extensor plantar responses, and/or spasticity, were present in 29% of patients, second motor neuron signs, such as fasciculations, wasting, weakness, or a neurogenic pattern on EMG in 18%, and both in 16%. Mixed motor and sensory neuronopathy was observed in 19% of patients. Among six non-RFC1 patients, one carried a heterozygous AAGGG expansion and a pathogenic variant in GRM1. Neuropathological examination of one RFC1 patient with an enriched phenotype, including parkinsonism, dysautonomia, and cognitive decline, showed posterior column and lumbar posterior root atrophy. Degeneration of the vestibulospinal and spinocerebellar tracts was mild. We observed marked astrocytic gliosis and axonal swelling of the synapse between first and second motor neurons in the anterior horn at the lumbar level. The cerebellum showed mild depletion of Purkinje cells, with empty baskets, torpedoes, and astrogliosis characterized by a disorganization of the Bergmann's radial glia. We found neuronal loss in the vagal nucleus. The pars compacta of the substantia nigra was depleted, with widespread Lewy bodies in the locus coeruleus, substantia nigra, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. We propose new guidelines for the screening of RFC1 expansion, considering different expansion motifs. Here, we developed a new method to more easily detect pathogenic RFC1 expansions. We report frequent motor neuron involvement and different neuronopathy subtypes. Parkinsonism was more prevalent in this cohort than in the general population, 10% versus the expected 1% (p < .001). We describe, for the first time, the spinal cord pathology in CANVAS, showing the alteration of posterior columns and roots, astrocytic gliosis and axonal swelling, suggesting motor neuron synaptic dysfunction.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

He then moved to Tennessee, where he established the town of LaFollette. His company, LaFollette Coal, Iron, and Railway Company, eventually employed more than 1500 people and was the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States.\nEarly life and education\nHarvey M. LaFollette was born in Primrose, Wisconsin. His first cousin, Robert Marion La Follette Sr., was three years old at the time and living on the adjoining farm. Harvey's father (also named Harvey M. LaFollette) was a farmer and served in local government both as sheriff and commissioner. When Harvey was two years old, his family relocated to join relatives in Thorntown, Indiana. Harvey's brother, William La Follette, was born shortly after they arrived in Indiana. When he was seven years old, his father was killed in an industrial accident while working on a piece of machinery in the flour mill he owned.\nYoung Harvey was always an avid reader, and after studying at the nearby Friends School and a short stint at Wabash College, he left for France, the land of his Huguenot ancestors, to continue his education. He studied in Paris at several institutions focusing on languages and civil engineering. He left Paris, travelling on foot and staying with peasant families to better understand the local dialects. He took additional courses in Germany and in Italy. He returned to Indiana in 1880 as a well-educated and travelled young man. He spoke five languages fluently.\nIndiana educator\nHe began teaching in the public schools as soon as he returned from abroad and became a school principal and a county superintendent before running for statewide office at the age of 28. He was elected to two terms as Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. In this job, he established a number of reforms as he standardized the textbooks and regularized the financial systems.\nLaFollette, Tennessee\nAlong with his youngest brother, Grant LaFollette, Harvey then moved some 400 miles (640 km) to the south and purchased more than 37,000 acres (150 km2) of land in the Tennessee mountains. He established and served as president and general manager of a company that eventually employed 1,500 people and became the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States. He built a railroad that allowed his product to be shipped. The town that grew up around his business venture was named LaFollette in his honor and became the county seat of Campbell County.\nPersonal life\nGlen Oaks\nHarvey built and lived in Glen Oaks, a 27\u2013room mansion in the center of LaFollette designed by Knoxville architect George Franklin Barber. The home on Indiana Avenue is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As his company grew, he traveled extensively and remained close to his extended family. During the glare of the Wisconsin governor's race of 1900, his mother and older brother and sister returned to Primrose with cousin Robert and other family members to visit the old log cabin where Harvey was born and to relive memories of the pioneering days of a half century earlier. During the next decade, Harvey and his wife were often in Washington, DC, visiting family members and meeting political allies. Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks was a friend from his younger days in Indiana. His brother and cousin both moved to the nation's capitol as members of Congress, and he visited them often. Later in his life, when the mines no longer produced and his business failed, he returned to his academic roots, corresponding with Abraham Lincoln scholar Louis A. Warren, who wrote The Lincoln and LaFollette Families in Pioneer Drama, a history of the Lincoln and LaFollette families on the Kentucky frontier in the years before Jesse LaFollette and Thomas Lincoln took their families across the Ohio River to settle in Indiana Territory.\nFamily\nHe was a member of the La Follette family. William La Follette was a younger brother. Robert M. La Follette Sr. was his first cousin. William Leroy LaFollette Jr. and Chester La Follette were nephews. Suzanne La Follette was a niece. Mimi LaFollette Summerskill was a grand niece. Her son was political leader Richard L. Wright. His only child, Warner Marion LaFollette, predeceased him. Harvey was visiting his brother, William, in Colfax, Washington when he died in 1929. Both he and William and other LaFollette family members are interred in the Colfax Cemetery in Whitman County, Washington.\n\nWho do you think the author of this is?

For instance, emotion recognition systems can detect subtle changes in facial expressions, tone of voice, or body language to determine whether a person is happy, sad, or anxious. Biometric categorization systems, on the other hand, can analyze physical characteristics such as height, weight, or facial features to group individuals into specific categories.\nThe use of these systems raises important ethical and legal questions, particularly with regards to privacy and data protection. For instance, how can individuals be assured that their biometric data is being collected and used in a responsible and transparent manner? What measures can be taken to prevent the misuse of this data, such as identity theft or discrimination? Furthermore, how can the accuracy and reliability of these systems be ensured, particularly in cases where the stakes are high, such as in criminal investigations or national security situations?\nAs the use of AI systems continues to grow and evolve, it is essential that policymakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders work together to develop robust frameworks and guidelines for the development, deployment, and use of these systems. This includes ensuring that individuals are aware of the data being collected and used, and that they have the ability to opt-out or correct any errors.

Atomic and molecular line emissions from shocks may provide valuable information on the injection of mechanical energy in the interstellar medium (ISM), the generation of turbulence, and the processes of phase transition between the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) and the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM).Aims. In this series of papers, we investigate the properties of shocks propagating in the WNM. Our objective is to identify the tracers of these shocks, use them to interpret ancillary observations of the local diffuse matter, and provide predictions for future observations. Methods. Shocks propagating in the WNM are studied using the Paris-Durham shock code, a multi-fluid model built to follow the thermodynamical and chemical structures of shock waves, at steady-state, in a plane-parallel geometry\n\nText continuation:\n.\nResults. The simulations reveal that the shocks are characterized by a complex interplay between the thermal and chemical structures, which in turn affect the emission properties of the gas. We find that the shocks produce a range of emission lines, including those of atomic and molecular species, which can be used as tracers of the shock properties. The simulations also suggest that the shocks can lead to the formation of dense, clumpy structures, which can be the precursors of star-forming regions.\nDiscussion. The results of our simulations have important implications for our understanding of the role of shocks in the ISM. The shocks can inject significant amounts of mechanical energy into the gas, which can drive the formation of turbulence and the generation of complex structures. The emission lines produced by the shocks can be used as a diagnostic tool to study the properties of the shocks and the surrounding gas. Furthermore, the simulations suggest that the shocks can play a key role in the formation of star-forming regions, by providing the necessary conditions for the collapse of dense gas.\nFuture Work. In future studies, we plan to explore the effects of the shocks on the surrounding gas in more detail, including the formation of dense structures and the injection of mechanical energy. We will also investigate the role of the shocks in the formation of star-forming regions, and explore the potential for using the emission lines produced by the shocks as a diagnostic tool to study the properties of the ISM.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

In this series of papers, we investigate the properties of shocks propagating in the WNM.

Shocks propagating in the WNM are studied using the Paris-Durham shock code, a multi-fluid model built to follow the thermodynamical and chemical structures of shock waves, at steady-state, in a plane-parallel geometry\n\nText continuation:\n. The code, already designed to take into account the impact of an external radiation field, is updated to treat self-irradiated shocks at intermediate ($30<V_S <100$ km s$^{-1}$) and high velocity ($V_S \\ge 100$ km s$^{-1}$) which emit ultraviolet (UV), extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), and X-ray photons. The couplings between the photons generated by the shock, the radiative precursor, and the shock structure are computed self-consistently using an exact radiative transfer algorithm for line emission. The resulting code is explored over a wide range of parameters ($0.1 \\le n_H \\le 2$ cm$^{-3}$, $10 \\le V_S \\le 500$ km s$^{-1}$, and $0.1 \\le B \\le 10$ $\\mu$G) that covers the typical conditions of the WNM in the solar neighborhood. Results. The explored physical conditions are prompt to the existence of a diversity of stationary magnetohydrodynamic solutions, including J-type, CJ-type, and C-type shocks. These shocks are found to naturally induce phase transition between the WNM and the CNM, provided that the postshock thermal pressure is larger than the maximum pressure of the WNM and that the maximum density allowed by magnetic compression is larger than the minimum density of the CNM. The input flux of mechanical energy is primarily reprocessed into line emissions from the X-ray to the submillimeter domain. Intermediate and high velocity shocks are found to generate a UV radiation field that scales as $V_S^3$ for $V_S < 100$ km s$^{-1}$ and as $V_S^2$ at higher velocities, and an X-ray radiation field that scales as $V_S^3$ for $V_S \\ge 100$ km s$^{-1}$. Both radiation fields may extend over large distances in the preshock depending of the density of the surrounding medium and the hardness of the X-ray field which is solely driven by the shock velocity. Conclusions. This first paper presents the thermochemical trajectories of shocks in the WNM and their associated spectra. It corresponds to a new milestone in the development of the Paris-Durham shock code and a stepping stone for the analysis of observations that will be carried out in forthcoming works.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

They say they like a certain musician, listen to that musician before the next time you see them so you can comment on that.  The easiest way to fake an interest in a person is not to fake it, genuinely look into what they are interested in.  \nIt doesn't even have to be something you like.  My friend is a football fan, and I fucking hate sports.  But I know the team she likes and the team she hates, and I put stuff from the team she hates on her desk at work.  Even if you do something annoying to tease a friend, at least do it in a way that shows you listen to what they say and see them.\nPhysical_Key_4041: so with the musician example say I listen to a band they recommend, how would I then comment about that band in the follow up conversation\nlike for example I like avatar the last air bender (show) yet even if I meet someone else who likes the show I wouldn\u2019t know how to talk about it with them, like do I just say \u201cI liked the band you recommended\u201d surely not that ain\u2019t really a convo, so like say I listen to the band they recommend, how would I then discuss that band with them \nor take avatar the last airbender how would I discuss the show with someone that\u2019s already seen it\nthe_entroponaut: That's an interesting question, because I guess if I said \"It will just flow from there\" then that wouldn't be helpful at all!  \nIt is tricky to answer though, because conversations are so dynamic that it is hard to apply programmatic rules to them.  I mean, I loved The Last Airbender, but it is hard to come up with cold topics about it.  Personally I might bring up themes of apotheosis in shows (though some people might think I'm pretentious for that, but I am pretentious so I guess that's just me).  Or how I really love that the series format can grant a long time for several character development arcs that a movie can't, evolving into a metal bender or a blood bender and such.  Basically you are going to go into some (but not exhaustive) detail about why you liked it, and your favorite parts, and find out theirs.\nAnd that guidelines applies to most topics.  Music talk tends to be a bit more shallow (unless you are a musician) than movie/TV talk.  It's usually along a format of \"I liked this band, it reminded me of this band, have you heard of them?\"  A finding common ground kind of thing.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Its robustness and flexibility have been demonstrated through its successful participation in multiple competitions, where it has consistently produced high-quality plans. The extension of the description language to include numerical state variables and action durations has enabled MIPS to tackle a broader range of planning problems, including those that require reasoning about time and resources.\nIn addition to its performance in planning competitions, MIPS has also been used in various real-world applications, such as scheduling and resource allocation in manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. Its ability to handle complex planning problems and generate high-quality plans has made it a valuable tool for organizations seeking to optimize their operations and improve their decision-making processes. As a result, MIPS has become a widely recognized and respected system in the field of artificial intelligence and planning, and its contributions have had a significant impact on the development of planning algorithms and techniques.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Plans were no longer sequences of actions but time-stamped schedules. As a participant of the fully automated track of the competition, MIPS has proven to be a general system; in each track\n\nText continuation:\nand every benchmark domain it efficiently computed plans of remarkable quality. This article introduces and analyzes the most important algorithmic novelties that were necessary to tackle the new layers of expressiveness in the benchmark problems and to achieve a high level of performance. The extensions include critical path analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal parallel plans. The linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses known NP hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect to the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations. The efficiency of this algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance: for each encountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is scheduled. One major strength of MIPS is its static analysis phase that grounds and simplifies parameterized predicates, functions and operators, that infers knowledge to minimize the state description length, and that detects domain object symmetries. The latter aspect is analyzed in detail. MIPS has been developed to serve as a complete and optimal state space planner, with admissible estimates, exploration engines and branching cuts.

For instance, the use of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology has been shown to provide highly accurate topographic data, even in complex urban environments. Additionally, the integration of multiple data sources, such as aerial imagery and ground-based sensors, can help to reduce errors and improve the overall accuracy of DEMs.\nFurthermore, the development of advanced computational methods and algorithms has enabled the creation of more sophisticated flood models that can better account for the complexities of overland flow and the influence of above-ground elements. These models can be used to simulate a wide range of flood scenarios, from small-scale flash floods to large-scale riverine floods, and can provide valuable insights into the behavior of floodwaters and the potential impacts of different flood mitigation strategies.\nDespite these advances, there is still much work to be done to fully understand the complexities of flood modeling and to develop more accurate and reliable flood risk assessments. Ongoing research is focused on addressing the challenges of DEM generation and refinement, as well as the development of more advanced computational methods and algorithms for flood modeling. By continuing to push the boundaries of what is possible with aerial photogrammetry and other technologies, researchers and practitioners can work together to improve our understanding of flood risk and to develop more effective strategies for mitigating the impacts of flood events.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

The purpose of this study is to investigate uncertainties related to (i) the own error of high resolution topographic data, and (ii) the modeller choices when including topographic data in hydraulic codes. The aim is to perform a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) which goes through a Monte-Carlo uncertainty propagation, to quantify impact of uncertainties, followed by a Sobol' indices computation, to rank influence of identified parameters on result variability. A process using a coupling of an environment for parametric computation (Prom{\\'e}th{\\'e}e) and a code relying on 2D shallow water equations (FullSWOF 2D) has been developed (P-FS tool). The study has been performed over the lower part of the Var river valley using the estimated hydrograph of 1994 flood event. HR topographic data has been made available for the study area, which is 17.5 km 2 , by Nice municipality. Three uncertain parameters were studied: the measurement error (var. E), the level of details of above-ground element representation in DEM (buildings, sidewalks, etc.) (var. S), and the spatial discretization resolution (grid cell size for regular mesh) (var. R). Parameter var. E follows a probability density function, whereas parameters var. S and var. R. are discrete operator choices. Combining these parameters, a database of 2, 000 simulations has been produced using P-FS tool implemented on a high performance computing structure.

One thing that really stuck out to me is that most restrooms here don't have paper towels or an electric hand dryer.  I didn't really know what to think, and I spent the first few weeks drying my hands on my hair, (killing two birds with one stone by conveniently styling it at the same time, haha) or on my pants.  Then I happened to be in the bathroom at the same time as one of my coworkers and I had to wait while he washed his hands before me.  Lo and behold, he pulls a handkerchief out of his pocket and dries his hands before leaving...  I was speechless!  Such a simple solution that solves many problems and is\n\nText continuation:\nnot only eco-friendly but also practical.\nI couldn't help but wonder why we don't use handkerchiefs more often in the West.  I mean, it's not like we don't have them, but for some reason, we've become so accustomed to using paper towels and electric hand dryers that it seems like a foreign concept to carry a small piece of cloth around with us.  And yet, it's so effective!  No more wasting paper, no more energy consumption, no more awkward moments when you're trying to dry your hands in a public restroom.  It's a win-win situation!\nAs I continued to observe my coworkers and the locals, I noticed that they all carried handkerchiefs with them, not just for drying their hands but also for wiping their noses, cleaning their faces, and even as a makeshift bandage if needed.  It was amazing to see how versatile and resourceful they were with such a simple tool.  And it got me thinking, why can't we do the same?  Why can't we adopt this simple yet effective habit and make a positive impact on our environment?\nI started carrying a handkerchief with me and I have to say, it's been a game-changer.  I no longer worry about running out of paper towels or having to search for a public restroom with an electric hand dryer.  I just carry my trusty handkerchief and I'm good to go.  And the best part is, it's not just about the environment; it's also about being more mindful and present in the moment.  When you're carrying a handkerchief, you're more aware of your surroundings, more aware of your body and your needs, and more aware of the simple pleasures in life.\nI know it may seem like a small change, but trust me, it's a big deal.  It's a small step towards a more sustainable future, a more mindful present, and a more resourceful you.  So, next time you're in a public restroom and you're tempted to reach for the paper towels, remember the handkerchief and the simple yet effective solution it provides.  You never know, you might just start a revolution!\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is? If you think you are, say \"Me\"; if you think someone else wrote, it say \"Another\".

Think about how many rolls of paper towel are used in every US bathroom every year...  Long story short - carry a handkerchief to dry your hands instead of using paper towels.  Other benefits include:  wiping your brow while performing stressful tasks, use as a pocket square in a pinch (if it looks nice and isn't too dirty), or blowing your nose when absolutely necessary.\nClintHammer: How is that environmentally friendly?  Paper is a farmed product.  The trees they grow for paper are grown for paper.  If you reduce demand for paper, you reduce the number of trees.\nThe only reason people say paper is bad for the environment is because to make the nice white paper that people like to print things on, the pulp has to be thoroughly treated with chemicals.

I also want to point out that cutting down on the amount of paper towels used will reduce the amount of plastic trash bags used in bathrooms as well, because without the trash constantly filling up, there is less of a need to empty it regularly.  My observation was simply that I never see people in the US carrying or using handkerchiefs, and it seems to be a staple EDC item in India.  I'm sorry if I offended your definition of a \"lifehack\", I just wanted to point out a difference in culture that I noticed that may appeal to certain people who don't find satisfaction in wiping their hands on paper towels every time they visit a restroom...\nClintHammer: &gt; I was merely pointing out a very simple (maybe obvious) use of a handkerchief\n\nYeah, you suggested someone use something for its intended purpose. \nhttp://i.imgur.com/OFi6aaV.png \nsupersasuke: You got me.

However, other branches of artificial intelligence have designed crucial ingredients towards autonomous learning: curiosity and intrinsic motivation, social learning and natural interaction with peers, and embodiment. These mechanisms guide exploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep learning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made great advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human learning. As argued convincingly by Lake et al., differences include human capabilities to learn causal models of the world from very little data, leveraging compositional representations and\n\nText continuation:\nhierarchical abstraction. Moreover, humans exhibit a remarkable ability to generalize and adapt to new situations, often relying on incomplete or noisy data.\nOne of the key challenges in developing autonomous lifelong learning systems is the ability to balance exploration and exploitation. Humans are able to strike a delicate balance between exploring new possibilities and exploiting what they already know, allowing them to adapt to changing environments and learn from experience. In contrast, current DL systems often struggle to balance these two competing goals, leading to a lack of adaptability and flexibility. To overcome this challenge, researchers are exploring new approaches that combine elements of curiosity-driven exploration with reinforcement learning, allowing agents to learn through trial and error while also adapting to new situations.\nAnother important consideration is the role of embodiment in autonomous learning. Humans learn and adapt through a combination of sensory input and motor output, allowing them to interact with the world in a meaningful way. In contrast, current DL systems are often limited to processing abstract representations of data, without the ability to interact with the physical world. To develop more human-like autonomous learning systems, researchers are exploring new approaches that integrate sensory-motor feedback with deep learning, allowing agents to learn through direct interaction with the environment.\nIn conclusion, autonomous lifelong development and learning is a complex and multifaceted capability that is still beyond the reach of current artificial intelligence systems. However, by combining elements of curiosity, social learning, and embodiment with deep learning, researchers are making progress towards developing more human-like autonomous learning systems.

However, other branches of artificial intelligence have designed crucial ingredients towards autonomous learning: curiosity and intrinsic motivation, social learning and natural interaction with peers, and embodiment. These mechanisms guide exploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep learning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made great advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human learning. As argued convincingly by Lake et al., differences include human capabilities to learn causal models of the world from very little data, leveraging compositional representations and\n\nText continuation:\npriors like intuitive physics and psychology. However, there are other fundamental differences between current DL systems and human learning, as well as technical ingredients to fill this gap, that are either superficially, or not adequately, discussed by Lake et al. These fundamental mechanisms relate to autonomous development and learning. They are bound to play a central role in artificial intelligence in the future. Current DL systems require engineers to manually specify a task-specific objective function for every new task, and learn through off-line processing of large training databases. On the contrary, humans learn autonomously open-ended repertoires of skills, deciding for themselves which goals to pursue or value, and which skills to explore, driven by intrinsic motivation/curiosity and social learning through natural interaction with peers. Such learning processes are incremental, online, and progressive. Human child development involves a progressive increase of complexity in a curriculum of learning where skills are explored, acquired, and built on each other, through particular ordering and timing. Finally, human learning happens in the physical world, and through bodily and physical experimentation, under severe constraints on energy, time, and computational resources. In the two last decades, the field of Developmental and Cognitive Robotics (Cangelosi and Schlesinger, 2015, Asada et al., 2009), in strong interaction with developmental psychology and neuroscience, has achieved significant advances in computational\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Put it around the edge\n\nText continuation:\n...\nYou know, I think Wolfiesden has a point. If the purpose of the LED strip is to illuminate the animal head, it might be more effective to place it in a way that creates a subtle glow rather than a harsh, direct light. Maybe you could try placing it around the edges of the plaque or along the contours of the animal's body. This would create a soft, ambient light that adds depth and interest to the overall design without being too overpowering.\nAnother option would be to use a diffuser to soften the light emitted by the LED strip. This could be a transparent or translucent material that is placed over the strip to scatter the light and reduce its intensity. This would help to create a more subtle, even illumination that wouldn't be too overwhelming.\nOf course, if you're looking to make the LED strip more of a decoration, Wolfiesden's suggestion to place it around the edge of the plaque is a great idea. This would create a nice, subtle border that adds visual interest to the overall design without being too distracting. You could also consider using a different color or pattern for the LED strip to match the overall aesthetic of the plaque and animal head.\nUltimately, the key is to experiment and find the right balance between light and shadow. By playing around with different placements and intensities, you should be able to find a solution that works for your specific needs and creates a visually appealing display.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Put it around the edge\n\nText continuation:\n.  Think Bar rope lights.\nIf you are going eye-catcher but want subtle, don't put it on the front.  Make the mount so it stands off the wall an inch or so and angle the led strip outward and back so it illuminates the WALL around the plaque.  That would draw attention to it but not make it an in-your-face light making it hard to look into.  Here is the wall effect I am thinking:\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/01/a4/a7/01a4a71296c19077fe300113f7fe0eb5.jpg\n\nAnother option is to edge light plexi.  You would put a plexiglas plate between the head and the wood plate and edge light the plexiglass.  The plexi could be routed (standard router) with a design or if you have a laser cutter, plexi is extremely easy to cut and etch, expecially with a CO2 laser.  Mine cuts very quickly and etches very well.  Here is an edge lit sign to get an idea:\nhttp://www.valleydesignsnd.com/catalog/images/products/ac10212015_2.jpg\nAnother option to look at is tossing the LED thing and looking at EL wire.  Its very flexible, easy to work with and isn't extremely intense like LED is.  Is more of a subtle but distinctive look.  Doesn't put out much light so won't do anything for lighting up your head.  But for eyecandy effects, its hard to discount.  Its soft and flexible enough to be woven into clothes and has been used in halloween costumes for quite a few years now.  Here is an example off google (not endorsing this site, just has a decent pic): \nhttps://glowproducts.com/media/catalog/product/cache/5/thumbnail/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/e/l/el_wire_kits_gp2.jpg\nYusunoha: Thank you for your reply and all the information. \nTo quickly summarize the project that I have in mind, I have a giraffe animal head that I want to put on a plaque, and make it look like the imguraffe. Imgur is about the color green, so I had the idea of adding LED's to the plague that you can set to green.\nThe effect what I'm trying to go after though is having the head be illuminated in a dark room. Having the back of the plague is an option I considered, but I wanted to focus the light on the head than rather on the plague. And by diffusing the light you will not be directly staring into the light.\nI had not considered the edge lit option, I'll take it into consideration, but I think it may be a step too far for me.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Delta cancellations will affect flights up until early Friday, according to a statement from the airline. The cancellations will affect flights through Friday, according to statements by both companies. A spokeswoman for Delta earlier said 325 flights would be canceled Thursday, but later said 275 flights were cut. \"Delta apologizes in advance for any inconvenience this may cause and is working to proactively contact and reaccommodate affected customers. Customers should call ahead to check flight status,\" a Delta statement said. Wednesday, American Airlines canceled 318 flights, said company spokesman Tim Wagner. The airline canceled 132 of its estimated 2,300 flights scheduled for Thursday, Wagner said, about 6 percent of the daily schedule. The cancellations forced dozens of people to spend the night in the atrium of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. They slept wherever they could -- on couches, on the floor, some on non-moving baggage carousels. Kelly said the airline rebooked flights and covered the cost of hotel and food for passengers on canceled flights. It was initially believed that Delta's MD-90 planes were part of the inspection but it was determined that the MD-88 planes were the only ones that needed to be inspected, a spokeswoman said. The airline said the checks are voluntary and are expected to be completed by week's end. American Airlines, meanwhile, is examining wiring secured to its MD-80 aircraft. In Atlanta, the cancellations caused grousing among passengers who missed job interviews, connecting flights and the comfort of their beds, CNN affiliate WXIA reported. \"They told us 6:45 (p.m.). Then they told us 7:30. Then 8, so on and so forth and they just canceled,\" passenger Fred Billizon told WXIA. \"So they had about 200 people just waiting on flights. And that's not a lot of happy people.\" This latest round of inspections was prompted by questions raised by the FAA and American safety officials about how a certain bundle of wires is secured to the MD-80 aircraft.

The Russian spacecraft that discovered it, Zond 3, was launched in 1965 and was designed to study the Moon's surface. The tower, which stands at an impressive height, has sparked widespread interest and speculation about its purpose and origin.\nSome experts believe that the tower could be a natural formation, created by geological processes over millions of years. Others think that it could be an artificial structure, built by an intelligent species. The possibility of extraterrestrial life is always a fascinating one, and the discovery of the tower has reignited interest in the search for life beyond Earth.\nMeanwhile, China's lunar rover, which is equipped with advanced sensors and cameras, is making its way to the tower. The rover is expected to transmit pictures and data back to Earth, which will help scientists to better understand the structure and its surroundings. The Chinese space agency has been making significant strides in recent years, and this mission is seen as a major milestone in its lunar exploration program.\nAs the world waits with bated breath for the rover's findings, the debate about the tower's origins continues to rage on. Some experts are skeptical about the possibility of extraterrestrial life, while others are more open-minded. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is certain - the discovery of the mysterious tower on the far side of the Moon has opened up a whole new frontier in space exploration and has sparked a renewed sense of wonder and curiosity about the universe.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

It works just fine and there's plenty of ring exercises. I'll assume you've already considered that\n\nText continuation:\nI understand your concern, Jreced. You're right, the Rings Routine (RR) is a great resource and a solid foundation for ring training. However, I'm looking for something more comprehensive and advanced. I've already mastered the basics and want to take my training to the next level.\nAfter further research, I came across some other programs that caught my attention. One of them is the \"Ring Training\" program by Antraniks. It's a comprehensive guide that covers a wide range of exercises, including some advanced ones like the \"ring muscle-up\" and \"ring L-sit\". The program also includes a workout plan and progressive overload guidelines, which I find very helpful.\nAnother program that I'm considering is the \"Rings of Power\" by Dragon Door. This program is specifically designed for ring training and includes a variety of exercises that target different muscle groups. It also includes a workout plan and some advanced techniques for more experienced trainers.\nI'm also looking at the \"Overcoming Gravity\" program, which is a more holistic approach to training. It covers not only ring exercises but also other forms of strength training and conditioning. The program is designed to help you build overall strength and fitness, rather than just focusing on ring training.\nFinally, I'm considering the \"Body by Rings\" program, which is a more specialized program that focuses specifically on ring training. It includes a variety of exercises and a workout plan, as well as some advanced techniques for more experienced trainers.\nOverall, I'm looking for a program that will help me take my ring training to the next level and provide me with a comprehensive and well-rounded workout routine. I'm hoping that one of these programs will be the right fit for me.\nDo you have any experience with any of these programs, Jreced? Or do you have any other recommendations for me? I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on these programs.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

This one requires the most thought.\n* I honestly wouldn't recommend anything by Dragon Door, that's just my opinion.\nAll are good resources, it just depends on your goals. Good luck choosing.\nBandatandWarrior: Do you mind if I ask why you wouldn't recommend anything by Dragon Door? I started using Convict Conditioning a month and a half ago and I'm seeing benefits. That said, I'm not the most athletic. I drank and smoked for years, so I'm gradually getting into body weight fitness. I'm genuinely curious though, as I've been doing it for such a short amount of time. I was going to supplement CC with the naked warrior as I heard good stuff. Any reasons why? I don't want to waste my money on an inferior product.\nThanks.\nJackofMA: If you choose to go Dragondoor, make sure you look at the Kindle versions on Amazon- not the PDF versions on the Dragondoor site. These are substantially cheaper than what is offered on the Dragondoor website for the paperback and for the Dragondoor PDF version. \nIn general, people are down on DD products because they are expensive with a lot of fluff. Full size pictures of one exercise when a smaller one would do. Huge margins and large type.\nThat being said- Naked Warrior is different from CC and may not offer what you are looking for. It focuses on techniques for tension to help you do one arm pushup and the pistol. Shows some progressions, but these boil down to manipulating height to make exercise easier. NW might help at the upper progressions of CC.\nWhether or not you get NW, do a search for Naked Warrior Bonus Material. One free pdf that comes up is for hanging leg raises. Pretty sure there is another one too. These are offered through the DD website, so it's not like you're downloading from some pirate site.\nBandatandWarrior: Thanks very much for the advice sir.\nAshamed to admit it but a month and a half in and I'm still on step one of the exercises. Since I turned 19 I let my fitness deteriorate badly. Only starting to get into it now as an outlet for my anxiety. Drives me crazy though because I boxed from 16 - 19 at an amateur level and used to be super fit. Anyway, thank you very much for taking time out of your day to comment.

I need a way to test those muscles to see if my pull-up isn't all/predominantly my arms. I might have a weak back, but I don't know it because technically I can do pull-ups, but maybe I'm calling on the wrong muscles. Or I'm not using the right muscles enough.\nLGPlatinum: Try doing front lever raises. \nBackanalia: Front Lever? Whoa, I am nowhere near able to do that. Is there something else?\nLGPlatinum: Man, just... Lat pulldown type movement. Or look up progressions. See if it's really easy for you. Scapula pull ups are great aswell. If you can't do more of those by leaning back a bit than you can do pull ups, you are arm dominant and need to fix that.\nBackanalia: If I am arm dominant, how do I fix it?\nLGPlatinum: Idk, try yourself.\nBackanalia: Do you know what exercises improve straight arm scapular strength?\nLGPlatinum: Scapula rows and pull ups.

Last week, I think the election coverage just sapped any motivation I had left. It's been a really rough time lately. I've been unemployed for over a month and getting lots of interviews but no offers yet. Things with the girlfriend have been bad and it's really hurt my outlook. Money is tight and up until Saturday my roommate and I had been unsuccessfully looking for a new tenant. Well now the election is decided, we have a new roommate, I had two promising interviews today and several scheduled for this week, and my girlfriend and I are gonna try to heal things tonight. So I forced myself to go outside and do some shit, although I admit it wasn't fucking easy to take that first\n\nText continuation:\nstep.\nI walked out the door, feeling the crisp autumn air hit my face, and immediately regretted not wearing a jacket. The sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the neighborhood, but I barely noticed. My mind was elsewhere, replaying all the negative thoughts and worries that had been plaguing me for weeks. I had to shake them off, though. I had to focus on the present moment and what I could control.\nAs I started my warm-up, my legs felt like lead and my lungs burned from lack of use. It was like my body was screaming at me to stop, to give up and go back to the comfort of my couch. But I pushed through the discomfort, gradually increasing my pace and intensity. The sweat started dripping down my face, and my muscles began to ache, but I kept going.\nThe first few reps of my workout were a struggle, but as I got into a rhythm, I started to feel a sense of accomplishment. I was doing it. I was taking control of my life, one rep at a time. The stress and anxiety that had been weighing me down started to lift, replaced by a sense of empowerment.\nAs I finished my workout and walked back into my apartment, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had faced my demons and come out on top. I knew that tomorrow would bring new challenges, but I was ready. I was ready to tackle whatever life threw my way, one rep at a time.\nAnd as I sat down to write this, I realized that maybe, just maybe, this little workout was more than just a physical exercise. Maybe it was a metaphor for life. Maybe it was a reminder that no matter how tough things get, we always have the power to take control, to push through the pain and come out stronger on the other side.\nI know that I still have a long way to go. I still have to face the uncertainty of my job search and the challenges of my relationship. But for now, I'm taking things one rep at a time. I'm taking control of my life, one workout at a time. And who knows, maybe someday I'll look back on this tough time and realize that it was the catalyst for something greater. Maybe someday I'll look back and say, \"You know what? That was the best thing that ever happened to me.\"\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is? If you think you are, say \"Me\"; if you think someone else wrote, it say \"Another\".

So I forced myself to go outside and do some shit, although I admit it wasn't fucking easy to take that first\n\nText continuation:\nstep. \n&amp;#x200B;\nI started by doing a bridge hold and trying to push my stomach as high in the air as possible. I'm not particularly flexible and my bridge kind of sucks, so I think it's important to keep stretching those muscles to get that synovial fluid in there. Followed up with a few L-Holds, and I was surprised to discover that I can actually hold my legs out almost straight with my butt almost completely off the ground for a couple seconds before collapsing. Couldn't even get my butt off the ground at all a few months ago. I rounded out the stretches with some twist holds and amazingly I can actually lock my hands behind my back on my right side. Left side is still pretty tight but I'm seeing slow progress with a hand towel. \n&amp;#x200B;\nOn to pushups. I started with just a few conventional pushups to get the blood circulating, and then a few close pushups. I migrated to one of the beer die tables in the backyard and did a few one-arm incline pushups with legs apart at first, then together. Legs together is so much fucking harder it's not even funny, even with such a steep incline. I can feel my feet slipping from underneath me. I'm trying so hard to not rotate my torso when coming back up, and I'm trying to avoid splaying my elbows. Left arm is having a hell of a time keeping up with the right. I transitioned to the ground for some slow and steady close pushups. I've stopped counting and recording reps like I used to, I just go until it hurts but before failure. \n&amp;#x200B;\nNext were leg raises. Started out on the ground with straight legs, and the next set I moved to the bar. Hanging leg raises are a lot harder for me because I feel more of a strain in my quads, and I tend to swing a little. I tried keeping my core flexed and tight the whole time to avoid swinging, but at this point I feel like I can get my muscles burning more on my back because my stamina is so much less while hanging. \n&amp;#x200B;\nFinally, grip training. Started with some clenched eagle claws, then 2 sets of 5 fingertip pushups to work the tops of the fingers. I did a few hangs from the bar to warm up, and then started some towel hangs. Jesus, is my endurance lower with the towel, and it's not even a thick one. But if I can get up to 30 seconds with the towel I'll be pretty happy with that, as I can do about a minute on the bar. \n&amp;#x200B;\nThat was it for the day. I went in, made my 1 giant meal for the day, started my fasting timer, and I'll try to hop on the stationary bike later tonight. Just thought I'd share this momentous day of getting off my ass and doing the right thing for a change. I'll keep going this whole week and stop being a lazy fuck. Thank you to this sub for keeping me mostly motivated throughout these many months. Cheers.\n5sav1age9: A week off can actually be really good for you and just what you need.

This is because the risk associated with the AI system may be mitigated by other safety components or features of the product or system. For example, a medical device that uses AI to diagnose a medical condition may be considered medium-risk if it is designed to provide a diagnosis that is reviewed and confirmed by a human healthcare professional.\nFurthermore, the EU's Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and the EU's In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR) provide for a risk-based approach to the classification of medical devices, including those that use AI. Under these regulations, the risk associated with a medical device is determined by the device's intended use, the level of invasiveness, and the potential harm that the device may cause if it fails or is used incorrectly. If an AI system is used in a medical device, the risk associated with the device will depend on the specific use case and the level of risk associated with the AI system itself.\nIn conclusion, the classification of an AI system as high-risk under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) does not necessarily mean that the product or system that incorporates the AI system is considered high-risk under the relevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. The risk associated with an AI system must be assessed in the context of the specific product or system in which it is used, and the risk-based approach provided for in the EU's Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and the EU's In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR) should be used to determine the appropriate level of risk associated with the device.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Although the plant response to environmental stresses is characterized by both architectural and functional plasticity, recent attempts to integrate biological knowledge into genetics models have mainly concerned specific physiological processes or crop models without architecture, and thus may prove limited when studying genotype x environment interactions. Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study introducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives access to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection and thus to promising tools for yield optimization\n\nText continuation:\n.\nBy incorporating genetics into the functional-structural growth model, we can better understand the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and ultimately yield. This approach allows us to simulate the behavior of different genotypes under various environmental conditions, enabling the prediction of phenotypic traits and the identification of QTL associated with these traits. The integration of genetics and functional-structural growth modeling also provides a framework for understanding how genetic variation affects plant architecture and function, which is essential for optimizing crop yields.\nThe functional-structural growth model used in this study is based on the concept of functional-structural plant modeling, which combines detailed descriptions of plant architecture and function with simulations of environmental conditions. This approach allows us to simulate the behavior of plants at the individual organ level, taking into account factors such as light, temperature, and water availability. The inclusion of genetics in this model enables us to simulate the effects of genetic variation on plant development and yield, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.\nThe simulation study presented in this paper demonstrates the potential of integrating genetics and functional-structural growth modeling to predict phenotypic traits and identify QTL associated with these traits. The results show that the genetic component of the model can accurately predict the behavior of different genotypes under various environmental conditions, and that the integration of genetics and functional-structural growth modeling can provide valuable insights into the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and yield. These findings have important implications for the development of breeding strategies and the optimization of crop yields, and highlight the potential of this approach for improving our understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and yield.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Methods: The GreenLab model was selected as a reasonable choice to link growth model parameters to QTL. Virtual genes and virtual chromosomes were defined to build a simple genetic model that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model. The QTL Cartographer software was used to study QTL detection of simulated plant traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotype for yield maximization based on the model parameters and the associated allelic combination. Key Results and Conclusions: By keeping the environmental factors constant and using a virtual population with a large number of individuals generated by a Mendelian genetic model, results for an ideal case could be simulated. Virtual QTL detection was compared in the case of phenotypic traits - such as cob weight - and when traits were model parameters, and was found to be more accurate in the latter case. The practical interest of this approach is illustrated by calculating the parameters (and the corresponding genotype) associated with yield optimization of a GreenLab maize model. The paper discusses the potentials of GreenLab to represent environment x genotype interactions, in particular through its main state variable, the ratio of biomass supply over demand.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

It uses electrical scattering matrices and noise wave vectors to describe receiver architectures of arbitrary topology and complexity. It differs from existing freely-available software mainly in that the scattering matrices used to describe the receiver and its components are analytic rather than numeric. This allows different types of modeling and analysis of receivers to be performed. Non-ideal behavior of receiver components can be parameterized in their scattering matrices. SNS enables the instrument designer to then derive analytic expressions for the signal and noise at the receiver outputs in terms of parameterized component imperfections, and predict their contribution to receiver\n\nText continuation:\nperformance.\nThe software library provides a comprehensive framework for receiver design and analysis, allowing users to model and simulate a wide range of receiver architectures, from simple to complex. It is particularly useful for designers of receivers for radio astronomy, radar, and other applications where high sensitivity and selectivity are required. The library's ability to model non-ideal component behavior allows for the analysis of receiver performance in the presence of noise and interference, and the optimization of receiver design to minimize these effects.\nOne of the key benefits of SNS is its ability to perform fast and accurate simulations of receiver behavior. This is achieved through the use of analytic scattering matrices, which allow for the rapid calculation of receiver output signals and noise levels. This enables designers to quickly explore the performance of different receiver architectures and optimize their design to meet specific requirements. Additionally, the library's ability to model non-ideal component behavior allows for the analysis of receiver performance in the presence of noise and interference, and the optimization of receiver design to minimize these effects.\nIn addition to its analytical capabilities, SNS also provides a range of visualization tools for analyzing and interpreting receiver performance. These tools allow users to visualize the signal and noise levels at different points in the receiver, and to identify areas where optimization is needed. This enables designers to quickly and effectively optimize their receiver designs, and to ensure that they meet the required performance specifications.\nOverall, SNS is a powerful tool for receiver design and analysis, providing a comprehensive framework for modeling and simulating receiver architectures.

It uses electrical scattering matrices and noise wave vectors to describe receiver architectures of arbitrary topology and complexity. It differs from existing freely-available software mainly in that the scattering matrices used to describe the receiver and its components are analytic rather than numeric. This allows different types of modeling and analysis of receivers to be performed. Non-ideal behavior of receiver components can be parameterized in their scattering matrices. SNS enables the instrument designer to then derive analytic expressions for the signal and noise at the receiver outputs in terms of parameterized component imperfections, and predict their contribution to receiver\n\nText continuation:\nsystematic errors precisely. This can drive the receiver design process by, for instance, allowing the instrument designer to identify which component imperfections contribute most to receiver systematic errors, and hence place firm specifications on individual components. Using SNS to perform this analysis is preferable to traditional Jones matrix-based analysis as it includes internal reflections and is able to model noise: two effects which Jones matrix analysis is unable to describe. SNS can be used to model any receiver in which the components can be described by scattering matrices. Of particular interest to the sub-mm and terahertz frequency regime is the choice between coherent and direct detection technologies. Steady improvements in mm and sub-mm Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) mean that coherent receivers with LNAs as their first active element are becoming increasingly competitive, in terms of sensitivity, with bolometer-based receivers at frequencies above ~100 GHz. As an example of the utility of SNS, we use it to compare two polarimeter architectures commonly used to perform measurements of the polarized Cosmic Microwave Background: differencing polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in polarization sensitive bolometer-based polarimeters; and pseudo-correlation polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in coherent, LNA-based, polarimeters. We parameterize common sources of receiver systematic errors in both architectures and compare them through their Mueller matrices, which encode how well the instruments measure the Stokes parameters of the incident radiation. These analytic Mueller matrices are used to demonstrate the different sources of systematic errors in differencing and correlation polarimeters.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

We will show how these divergences can be modified to be suitable for linear inverse problems, where the data fields are non-negative and do not necessarily sum up to one. We will also introduce new divergences that are specifically designed for these problems.\nThe proposed divergences will be tested on various linear inverse problems, such as image deblurring, tomography, and spectroscopy. We will demonstrate their effectiveness in quantifying the discrepancy between the observed data and the reconstructed images, and show how they can be used to improve the reconstruction algorithms.\nFurthermore, we will discuss the connection between the proposed divergences and other metrics used in linear inverse problems, such as the mean squared error and the peak signal-to-noise ratio. We will also explore the potential applications of the proposed divergences in other fields, such as machine learning and signal processing.\nThroughout the book, we will provide numerous examples and illustrations to help the reader understand the concepts and methods presented.

The resolution of inverse problems implies systematically the minimisation of a divergence between physical measurements and a model depending of the unknown parameters. In the context image reconstruction, the model is generally linear and the constraints that must be taken into account are the non-negativity as well as (if necessary) the sum constraint of the unknown parameters. To take into account in a simple way the sum constraint, we introduce the class of scale invariant or affine invariant divergences. Such divergences remains unchanged when the model parameters are multiplied by a constant positive factor. We show the general properties of the invariance factors, and we give some interesting characteristics of such divergences.An extension of such divergences allows to obtain the property of invariance with respect to both the arguments of the divergences; this characteristic can be used to introduce the smoothness regularization of inverse problems, that is a regularisation in the sense of Tikhonov.We then develop in a last step, minimisation methods of the divergences subject to non-negativity and sum constraints on the solution components. These methods are founded on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions that must be fulfilled at the optimum. The Tikhonov regularization is considered in these methods.Chapter 11 associated with Appendix 9 deal with the application to the NMF, while Chapter 12 is dedicated to the Blind Deconvolution problem.In these two chapters, the interest of the scale invariant divergences is highlighted.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

The train, inaugurated in 1946, originally ran from Cincinnati, Ohio, to New Orleans, Louisiana, via Louisville, Nashville, Birmingham, Montgomery and Mobile and later via a connection at Bowling Green, Kentucky, to Memphis, Tennessee. A connection to Chicago was provided by the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad.\nThe Humming Bird had separate sections in the north and the south. The main northern part originated in Cincinnati; other sections (of the L&N's Georgian) originated in St. Louis and from Chicago. These sections linked with the main part of the train in Nashville. At Bowling Green, Kentucky, a southwest-bound section broke off, bound for Memphis; whereas the main southern route continued south to\n\nText continuation:\nMobile, Alabama, where it connected with the Gulf Coast Limited, a train operated by the Illinois Central Railroad.\nThe Humming Bird was known for its luxurious accommodations, including sleeping cars, dining cars, and observation cars. The train featured a distinctive silver and blue color scheme, with a logo featuring a hummingbird, which was a symbol of the railroad. The train was also famous for its on-board amenities, including fine dining, entertainment, and comfortable sleeping quarters.\nAs the years went by, the Humming Bird continued to operate, with occasional changes to its route and schedule. In the 1960s, the train was modified to include air-conditioned cars, and in the 1970s, it was upgraded to include diesel locomotives. Despite these changes, the Humming Bird remained a popular choice for travelers, particularly those looking for a comfortable and convenient way to travel between the Midwest and the Gulf Coast.\nIn the 1980s, the Humming Bird was merged with other trains operated by the L&N, and it was eventually discontinued in the 1990s. However, its legacy lives on, with many railroad enthusiasts still fondly remembering the train's luxurious accommodations and scenic route. Today, the Humming Bird is remembered as a symbol of the golden age of American rail travel, a time when trains were the primary mode of transportation and the railroad was a vital part of the country's infrastructure.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Train 6 was the northbound number.\nThe original equipment was part of a 28-car order of four train sets of lightweight stainless steel cars built in 1946 by ACF. Fourteen cars were assigned to the Humming Bird and fourteen to the Georgian. Many of those cars were removed from service in the late 1960s due to severe corrosion problems.\nThe L&N Railroad served the old Union Station in Memphis, until its closure on April 1, 1964. The railroad then used Central Station. Both L&N and Southern Railway were forced to reopen part of Union Station on December 1, 1966, and use it until March 30, 1968.\nThe Humming Bird was canceled on January 9, 1969. At that time, the L&N Railroad earned some unwanted publicity when it terminated the final run of the train en route southbound at Birmingham when a federal judge lifted the order keeping the train running after the Interstate Commerce Commission approved its permanent discontinuance.

In other words, the neocortex slowly learns long-term memories with a transient support of the hippocampus that quickly learns unstable memories. However, it is not clear yet what could be the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these differences in learning rates and memory time-scales. Here, we propose a novel modelling approach of the standard consolidation theory, that focuses on its potential neurobiological mechanisms. In addition to synaptic plasticity and spike frequency adaptation, our model incorporates adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus as well as the difference in size between the neocortex and the hippocampus, that we\n\nText continuation:\nbelieve play a crucial role in the consolidation process.\nOur model suggests that the hippocampus acts as a \"filter\" for the neocortex, allowing only relevant information to be consolidated into long-term memory. This is achieved through the process of synaptic plasticity, which allows the strength of connections between neurons to be modified based on experience. The hippocampus also plays a role in the process of spike frequency adaptation, which helps to refine the timing of neural activity and ensure that the information is properly consolidated.\nIn addition to these mechanisms, our model also incorporates the process of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. This process, which is unique to the hippocampus, allows for the generation of new neurons throughout adulthood. We propose that these new neurons play a critical role in the consolidation process, as they provide a \"fresh start\" for the formation of new memories.\nOur model also takes into account the difference in size between the neocortex and the hippocampus. The neocortex is much larger than the hippocampus, and this difference in size may play a role in the differences in learning rates and memory time-scales. For example, the larger size of the neocortex may allow for the storage of more information, but this may also make it more difficult for the information to be consolidated into long-term memory.\nOverall, our model provides a novel framework for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the standard consolidation theory. By incorporating a range of mechanisms, including synaptic plasticity, spike frequency adaptation, adult neurogenesis, and differences in size between the neocortex and hippocampus, our model provides a more comprehensive understanding of the processes involved in memory consolidation. Future studies can use this model as a starting point for further investigation into the mechanisms of memory consolidation, and can help to shed light on the complex relationships between the hippocampus, neocortex, and other brain regions.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

We also take into account the interconnected spatial structure of the involved brain areas, by incorporating the above neurobiological mechanisms in a coupled neural field framework, where each area is represented by a separate neural field with intra- and inter-area connections. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply neural fields to this process. Using numerical simulations and mathematical analysis, we explore the short-term and long-term dynamics of the model upon alternance of phases of hippocampal replay and retrieval cue of an external input. This external input is encodable as a memory pattern in the form of a multiple bump attractor pattern in the individual neural fields. In the model, hippocampal memory patterns become encoded first, before neocortical ones, because of the smaller distances between the bumps of the hippocampal memory patterns. As a result, retrieval of the input pattern in the neocortex at short time-scales necessitates the additional input delivered by the memory pattern of the hippocampus. Neocortical memory patterns progressively consolidate at longer times, up to a point where their retrieval does not need the support of the hippocampus anymore. At longer times, perturbation of the hippocampal neural fields by neurogenesis erases the hippocampus pattern, leading to a final state where the memory pattern is exclusively evoked in the neocortex. Therefore, the dynamics of our model successfully reproduces the main features of the standard consolidation theory. This suggests that neurogenesis in the hippocampus and distance-dependent synaptic plasticity coupled to synaptic depression and spike frequency adaptation, are indeed critical neurobiological processes in memory consolidation.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

The \"Barbie Bandits\" helped their hometown earn the dubious distinction as the nation's bank robbery capital. Here one of the so-called \"Barbie Bandits\" is captured on surveillance video at a surburban Atlanta bank. Atlanta's FBI field division topped Los Angeles in reporting the most bank heists, with 350 for the 12 months ending September 30, 2007, according to the FBI, which annually names areas most prone to bank robberies. The Los Angeles area was No. 2 with 338 heists, followed by Philadelphia with 316. Just Thursday, two suspects overpowered a security guard at an Atlanta, Georgia, bank, took his gun, robbed the bank and fled with money in hand, police said. Eventually, police shot one of the suspects in an exchange of gunfire. Two more armed bank robberies took place in metro Atlanta Friday. The FBI says violent crime is up across the nation, especially in major metro areas like Atlanta. So it's no surprise Atlanta has become a prime target for bank robberies, FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett told CNN.  Watch Hotlanta or Heistlanta? \u00bb . \"This goes hand in hand with those figures,\" Emmett said. Atlanta's rapid growth over the last decade has also been a factor. A recent Atlanta Business Chronicle article reported that metro Atlanta has 26 more banks than in all of North Carolina -- roughly one bank for every 3,500 people in the region.  See photos of bank heists in metro Atlanta \u00bb . \"We would attribute a lot of that [bank robberies] to the growth and the fact that the banking industry has matched that growth with an increase in bank branches throughout the area,\" Emmett said. Atlanta's rise in bank heists comes just as Los Angeles has aggressively countered once out-of-control bank robberies. Los Angeles has gone from more than 500 bank robberies in the mid-2000s to this year's 338, the FBI stats show. According to the FBI, its Atlanta field division reported 350 bank robberies in the last year -- the most notorious of which were the \"Barbie Bandits\" and \"Grandpa Bandit\" robberies. The FBI says 122 of the heists were armed robberies, or robberies where a weapon was visibly used. Emmett said many more of the robberies were what law enforcement officers classify as \"note jobs\" -- where a robber gestures as if he or she has a gun on them in a demand note handed over to the teller. Also factored into the total number of robberies were ATM heists and a record nine armored car robberies. Those armored car robberies are particularly disturbing to Emmett. \"Anyone that would confront an armored car courier knowing that he's already armed and in somewhat of a defensive posture, that mindset is very troubling for law enforcement,\" he said. While Emmett said there is no \"typical\" bank robber, he said he has seen some trends, most notably that they are often people battling drug addictions. He also said bank robbers are often repeat offenders. Two recent high-profile cases in Atlanta seem to confirm that. Two women dubbed the \"Barbie Bandits\" were arrested after working with a bank employee to rob a Bank of America in the Atlanta suburb of Acworth. They both later admitted to police to having drug addiction problems. Recently apprehended 69-year-old Bobby Joe Phillips, dubbed the \"Grandpa Bandit,\" is suspected to have robbed seven banks in Tennessee and the Atlanta area and had a criminal history. Emmett says typically very little money is taken in a bank heist. Joe Brannen, president of the Georgia Bankers Association, agrees, saying \"the average is $2,000 to $3,000. It's not as big a payoff as most people think it is.\" With the holidays in full swing, authorities are steeling themselves for a spate of bank robberies with robbers looking for quick holiday cash. \"I would make the assumption that a large part of it is the increased [financial] pressures this time of year,\" said Brannen. The FBI advises banks to be extra vigilant this time of year and to keep a close eye on jittery individuals donning gloves, hats and sunglasses. But Brannen says profiling people like that can be problematic. \"We've chosen not to go there. Here in Atlanta, lots of people wear head coverings for religious purposes. This is a free and open society,\" he said. He said customers want to come into a bank unimpeded -- that 99.9 percent are just customers, not bank robbers. Brannen says banks do all they can to balance convenience for their customers and the bank's need for security. \"There is no good, magic solution.\" he says. Emmett said as long as metro Atlanta continues to grow, so will the number of bank robberies. \"This is something that is part of growth. We have more banks. We have more people.

If not, what's wrong with that? Hypertrophy is the goal btw\nwerdiser: Not a bad idea to do a regression as super sets. After a paired set (such as weighed pulls and dips), I occasionally will add a little volume at the end with a couple sets of regular pulls / dips. I do them after I finish the main part of the workout so it doesn't affect my other pair (rows / pushups)\n592dan: Decline, pseudo, dips, pike are the main exercises in my push routine. So you could say the diamonds and wide are a regression\nwerdiser: Yea, if your main goal is hypertrophy then I would still recommend doing those extra sets after your main strength focused exercises.\nI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re doing RR but if time becomes a factor maybe a Push/Pull split might work better for you?\n592dan: They're all hypertrophy focused. I'll still do them but I'm wondering if I superset some exercises. I'm not doing the RR, I do a ppl.\nwerdiser: Yea then supersets should be fine!\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Cluster bombs are usually air-dropped shells that eject multiple small bomblets to kill enemy soldiers. A document released by Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs says the countries agreed never to use cluster munitions or the explosive bomblets they contain. The countries also agreed never to develop, acquire, retain or transfer cluster munitions. Countries attending the 11-day conference agreed to the treaty Wednesday but formally signed it Friday. The accord calls for a total, immediate ban of the weapons, strong standards to protect those injured by them, contaminated areas to be cleaned up as quickly as possible and for the weapons to be immediately destroyed, he said. Thomas Nash, coordinator of the CMC campaigning organization, said Wednesday: \"This is a great achievement for everyone who has been working hard to see the end of 40 years of suffering from these weapons.\" Though some of the biggest makers of cluster bombs, including the United States, Russia, China and Israel, were not involved in the talks and have not signed the accord, organizers predicted that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance. \"Take the United States,\" Nash said. \"Almost all of its allies are here. They've decided to ban these weapons. That's going to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to ever use these weapons again, either on its own or in joint operations.\" The agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years, he said. Cluster munitions, which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets, are what the International Committee of the Red Cross calls a \"persistent humanitarian problem.\" Most of a cluster bomb's bomblets are meant to explode on impact, but many do not. Estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time, the Red Cross says. That means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area, often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians. Last week, Acting Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Stephen D. Mull called it \"an absolute moral obligation\" to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle. But he also predicted that the United States would not agree to any ban. \"We think that it is going to be impossible to ban cluster munitions... because these are weapons that have a certain military utility and are of use,\" Mull said. \"The United States relies on them as an important part of our own defense strategy.\" Instead, he urged that the weapons be regulated \"to take humanitarian considerations into account\" and that \"technological fixes\" be pursued that would render them harmless after a battle. During the 34-day war in Lebanon in 2006, the United Nations estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets, 1 million of which may not have exploded, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. More than 250 civilians and bomb-disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern Lebanon since the war ended. Cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in Kosovo. Lt. Col. Jim Burke, a military adviser to the Irish Defense Forces said they quickly became a major killer of civilians. In more than 20 countries, according to the ICRC, cluster bombs have created lasting \"no-go\" areas, rendering them as dangerous as minefields. Laos is the most affected country. Millions of bomblets dropped during the Vietnam War continue to kill civilians more than three decades later. Still, militaries consider cluster bombs important for use against multiple targets dispersed over a wide area, such as tanks or military personnel moving across the landscape. A single bomb containing hundreds of submunitions can cover more than 18 square miles. CNN's Jacqueline Clyne contributed to this report.\n\nSummary:\nMore than 100 countries adopt treaty to ban cluster bombs, which often harm civilians long after conflicts end.\nThe treaty bans the use, development, and transfer of cluster munitions and their explosive bomblets.\nCountries agree to destroy stockpiles within eight years and clean up contaminated areas quickly.\nThe agreement aims to end 40 years of suffering from these unreliable and inaccurate weapons.\n\nWho do you think the author of this is?

Rev. D 80, 024015, arxiv:0808.3484) that the equation of state (ES) of extremely hot Fermi-Dirac gas in the surface layer of an ultra-relativistic compact object converges to the same form as the relativistic equation of thermodynamical equilibrium (RETE), which is the condition of stability of the object. The description of energy state of a gas particle was completed with the term corresponding with the potential-type energy. The necessity of such the term is set by the demand of convergence of the relativistic particle-impulse distribution law to its Maxwell-Boltzmann form in the classical limit. The identity of the ES and RETE, both applied to the gas in the object's surface layer, becomes\n\nText continuation:\nmore evident when considering the implications of this convergence on the behavior of the gas in the vicinity of the event horizon. In particular, the study reveals that the Fermi-Dirac gas exhibits a unique property, known as \"quantum smearing,\" which arises from the interplay between the quantum nature of the gas and the strong gravitational field of the compact object. This smearing effect leads to a modification of the equation of state, which in turn affects the stability of the object. The investigation also highlights the importance of considering the effects of quantum statistics on the behavior of the gas in the surface layer, as these effects can significantly impact the overall stability of the compact object. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the relativistic equation of thermodynamical equilibrium can be used as a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of extreme astrophysical systems, such as black holes and neutron stars.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

The identity of the ES and RETE, both applied to the gas in the object's surface layer, becomes\n\nText continuation:\nperfect, yielding the stable object, when the object's physical radius is identical to its gravitational radius. In this state, the internal energy of gas particles in a volume of the object's surface layer increases over all limits in the frame of the volume and this opens the question if the horizon of events actually is an insuperable barrier. It seems to be possible that some matter can be temporarily lifted above the surface or, so far, be ejected from the object and can emit a radiation detectable by a distant observer. In our contribution, we demonstrate a general validity of the functional form of the potential-type energy found in our previous work. The consistency of the RETE with its non-relativistic approximation can occur only for this functional form. We also point out some observational consequences of the approximate identity of ES and RETE before the object collapses, in the proper time, to its gravitational radius as well as the possible observational consequences of the infinitely high internal energy in the surface layer of already collapsed object. In general, we propagate the idea that a lot of phenomena observed at the stellar-sized or supermassive black holes (or not-yet black holes) can be not necessarily related to the structures in a vicinity of the black hole, e.g. to an accretion disk, but they can be linked directly to the behaviour of the central, ultra-compact object.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

He made his first senior appearance for Hibernian, during a temporary loan in March 1942. Niven was also loaned to Dundee before he broke into the East Fife first team. He was their regular first choice goalkeeper during their period of success after the Second World War. Niven only conceded one goal in 210 minutes of football in the 1947 Scottish League Cup Final win against Falkirk.

Niven\n\nText continuation:\n's impressive performances earned him a permanent move to Hibernian in 1949, where he went on to make over 100 appearances for the club. He was a key player in the team that finished third in the Scottish First Division in the 1950-51 season. Niven's consistency and shot-stopping ability made him a fan favorite at Easter Road, and he remained a loyal servant to the club until his retirement in 1957.\nAfter hanging up his boots, Niven went on to manage several amateur teams, including his old club Renfrew, where he won the Scottish Amateur Cup in 1961. He also worked as a coach and goalkeeper coach for various clubs, including Hibernian, where he helped develop the skills of several young goalkeepers. Niven's legacy as one of Scotland's greatest goalkeepers was cemented in 2007, when he was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. Despite his passing in 2011, Niven's memory lives on through the countless fans who remember his incredible performances on the pitch and his dedication to the beautiful game.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Easson conceded a goal within 30 seconds and East Fife went on to lose 3\u20130.\nNiven was transferred to Kilmarnock in 1951. He played in the 1952 Scottish League Cup Final, which Kilmarnock lost 2\u20130 to Dundee. Niven retired from senior football in 1953 and became a mechanical engineer, working for  Sir William Arrol & Co. He then set up a motor factor business, which he operated until his retirement in 1988. Niven suffered from Parkinson's disease in later life. He died in April 2011, and was survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Although there are many styles of motorcycles, they are loosely organized into 6 main categories.  These categories most closely align to the intended use of the vehicle.  There is your standard motorcycle, your more relaxed cruising motorcycle, the larger capacity and longer haul touring cycle, a racing more sportier sports cycle and then you have a off-road motorcycle often known as a dirtbike and lastly a dual-sport which is a motorcycle that can go both on and offroad.\n\nWho do you think the author of this is?

The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive aim to ensure that AI systems are designed and developed with security in mind, and that they are subject to regular security testing and monitoring. Furthermore, the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act proposes to establish a set of rules for the development, deployment and use of AI systems, including requirements for transparency, explainability and accountability.\nIn addition to these legislative measures, the development and deployment of AI systems should also be guided by industry-recognized best practices and standards. For example, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has developed a set of standards for the security and reliability of AI systems, including ISO 30111:2020, which provides guidelines for the development and testing of AI systems. Similarly, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has developed a set of standards for the cybersecurity of AI systems, including IEC 62443-4-2, which provides guidelines for the secure development and deployment of AI systems.\nBy taking a proactive and comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, the development and deployment of AI systems can be made safer and more secure, and the risks associated with these systems can be minimized.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.

Add some cold water for the temperature you like. Use\n\nText continuation:\na large bucket or a tub to take a warm bath. This way you can at least get clean and warm up before heading to work.\nI have to admit, the idea of boiling water and mixing it with cold water to create a warm bath sounds like a decent solution. I might have to give it a try. But I'm still a bit hesitant, as I'm not sure how long it would take to boil enough water to make it worth my while. And what about the logistics of carrying the bucket or tub to my workplace? It's not exactly something you can easily do without drawing attention to yourself.\nBut I suppose it's better than nothing. And who knows, maybe it'll be a good conversation starter at work. \"Hey, Bob, check out my makeshift bathwater bucket! Yeah, I had to get creative this morning without hot water.\" Yeah, that's exactly what I need, to be known as the guy who takes a bucket bath at work.\nOn the other hand, maybe I could try to find a nearby public shower or gym that has hot water. That way, I could at least get a decent shower in before heading to work. But that would require me to leave my house earlier than I had planned, and I'm already running behind schedule as it is.\nUgh, this is such a hassle. I just want to be able to take a warm shower and get ready for the day without having to go through all this trouble. Is that too much to ask? I guess I'll just have to make do with the situation and hope that the hot water heater gets fixed soon.\nAs I'm standing there, trying to decide what to do, I hear the sound of the kettle whistling in the background. Ah, maybe I can use that hot water to make some tea or coffee to warm me up. That's a small consolation, but it's better than nothing. And who knows, maybe the warmth of the tea will give me the energy to tackle the day ahead, even without a hot shower.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

It won't be as pleasant as a hot shower but at least you'll be clean. I grew up in a shockingly poor part of the rural south in the United States. If you live in the US, having to boil water on the stove to take a bath is my litmus test for just how poor you grew up. No matter what, this method beats a cold shower any day. My parents loved us but damn, their struggle was real... wow, this post made me feel all kind of ways. I'm going to go take a hot shower now. Love you mom and dad!\nMadwoman-of-Chaillot: I was laid off two weeks after my husband and I had just bought our house (a fixer-upper, b/c that's all we could afford). We struggled to pay the mortgage, and our hot water heater broke. We couldn't afford to fix it. So that whole winter, we heated up water on the stove so that we could bathe. Our furnace blew out on New Year's Eve, too, so we spent a cozy few weeks huddled with the dogs in front of the fireplace. I'm oddly glad that those things happened because I don't take anything for granted anymore.\nMiss_Bloody_Bonnie: One of my most fond memories started with a broken water heater. I had moved back to the state my SO lived in and we were temporarily staying with his parents. I was the only one with a job at the moment (FIL retired, MIL looking for a job, SO laid off and looking). I worked graveyard and the hot water heater was broken so I bathed with cold water in March which is quite chilly here. I woke up one night dreading my cold bucket \"shower\", but heard a lot of commotion outside the room. My in-laws and bf were all heating water in multiple pots and filling the tub so I could take a warm bath. My FIL said you're the only one who has to go to work right now, it's the least we can we do. That melted my heart. Yeah, I married into that family and have never looked back.\nDogOwner3: That is beautiful\nMiss_Bloody_Bonnie: Thank you! That is definitely a cherished memory. Side note, what kind of dog(s) do you own?\nDogOwner3: Sorry for the late reply.  I currently have a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, Toller for short :) We had a husky before him. Do you have any dogs?\nMiss_Bloody_Bonnie: I do! We have an Olde English Bulldogge and a Rhodesian Ridgeback/pitbull/whatever mix. They are currently taking up 70% of the bed, the cats have 10% and my husband and I have the remaining 20%.\nDogOwner3: Hahaha.  We have 2 cats too. It's surprising how much room the three of them take up :)\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

In the same way, the government and societal structures that perpetuate these beliefs about women are also responsible for creating an environment that is hostile towards them. We can't just focus on the individuals who carry out these actions, but also the systems and institutions that enable and perpetuate them.\nAs we continue to discuss this topic, it's essential to recognize that the issue of misogyny and oppression is deeply rooted in societal structures and power dynamics. It's not just about individual people, but about the systems and institutions that perpetuate these beliefs and actions.\nIn the case of Najmia, she is a victim of these societal structures, but she is also a symbol of resistance and defiance. Her decision to not wear her hijab despite being harassed is a powerful statement against the oppressive norms that seek to control her and other women. It's a reminder that women have the power to resist and challenge these norms, and that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.\nAs we move forward, it's crucial that we continue to have these conversations and challenge the societal structures that perpetuate misogyny and oppression. We need to recognize that these issues are complex and multifaceted, and that they require a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of these problems.\nUltimately, it's up to us to create a society that values and respects all individuals, regardless of their gender, race, religion, or any other characteristic. We need to work towards a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential, free from the constraints of oppressive societal structures.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

I would say the children in Hitler youth were first generation victims. \nYou don't get to be a victim of the system when you installed it.\nWhat's more is a bully who was made a bully by the system is still a bully.  You can be a victim and also an asshole. You can be mad at Hitler and the environment that raised him. But Hitler had access to different viewpoints and picked the one he arrived at despite education. These kids don't have that luxury. When someone disagrees,  men with sticks show up and beat the hell out of them.\nSakuraba85: What do you mean? Hitler was shaped by his education and upbringing just like these men. \nHe grew up with being ashamed of how Germany acted and was treated after WW1 and was taught about that in school and his society.\nlightknight7777: The reason Hitler was evil wasn't him being mad at how Germany was treated.  It wasn't even him wanting to make Germany powerful again.  Conquerers have existed all throughout history without being known from then on as evil.  It was the \"genocide\" bit that made him the image of evil. Out of a plethora of perfectly viable options, he decided on concentration camps and murder. \nThere's a massive difference between being raised to think something bad is \"the truth\" vs specifically seeking out something bad to believe in from options. He arrived at his particular brand of insanity after significant research and adult social circles. You can be mad at him even having that path to come to. Heck, antisemitism was super common at the time (even in the US), but him going \"therefore let's remove them\" was  on him. Every other government was managing to not round them up and murder them.\nSakuraba85: Ok, i understand. It\u2019s not evil wanting to hang children because they don\u2019t want to have fabric on their heads. Got it. It\u2019s not their fault.\nlightknight7777: As I stated,  a bully who was made a bully by their system is still a bully. Them espousing the evil beliefs they were taught is still bad but they are also victims as well. \nWhat you don't seem to be accepting is my primary point that the system that produces evil is more evil than the individuals. At no point did I say they weren't espousing evil. But you strawmanning my position is unnecessary.\nmynameisnotlarrybob: Good job, you won!\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

This language can be problematic, as it perpetuates a harmful narrative that people with sickle cell disease are somehow less worthy or inferior. By reframing the conversation to focus on the genetic advantage conferred by sickle cell disease, we can begin to challenge these harmful assumptions and work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.\nMoreover, it's essential to recognize that the concept of \"defect\" is often tied to societal and cultural norms, rather than being an objective scientific fact. For instance, in many parts of the world, people with sickle cell disease are not stigmatized or viewed as having a defect, but rather as having a unique set of characteristics that are valued and respected. This highlights the importance of considering the cultural and social contexts in which we use language and make decisions about genetic modification.\nUltimately, the debate surrounding CRISPR and sickle cell disease is not simply about whether the condition is a defect or an advantage, but rather about how we choose to value and prioritize human life. By acknowledging the complex and multifaceted nature of this issue, we can work towards a more nuanced and compassionate understanding of what it means to be human.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Malaria is curable in the modern world, sickle-cell disease is not.

If something is an advantage, you'd prefer to have it, right? If you're just totally unable to think about it, let's put it a different way: what has been more useful in your life so far, malaria resistance, or not having to deal with pain and organ failure? Did you ever play competitive sports in school? Would you have given that up to avoid malaria? Have you ever not dressed up warmly enough to go out? In that situation, would you have preferred to worry about your risk of malaria, or about permanent tissue damage and, once again, intractable pain lasting days or longer? Because you see, I'm quite sure that you've never once seriously worried you might die of malaria, but you've enjoyed at least some amount of time without chronic pain and the impending doom if an early death from an incurable genetic disorder...\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Hillary Clinton rebounded from her third-place finish in last week's Iowa caucuses. Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent the past few days saying she has the experience to change Washington. She narrowly defeated Sen. Barack Obama in the New Hampshire primary, with 39 percent of the vote to Obama's 37. \"Last week, I listened to you, and in the process I found my own voice,\" the New York senator said after her victory. \"Now let's give America the kind of comeback that New Hampshire has just given me.\" Forty-three percent of self-styled independents said they voted for Obama, and 31 percent said they backed Clinton. Independents made up 43 percent of all voters polled. Addressing his roaring supporters after the race was called, Obama congratulated Clinton. But he was a candidate determined to draw a distinction between Clinton and himself. \"But the reason our campaign has always been different, the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago, is because it's not just about what I will do as president,\" he said. \"It is also about what you, the people who love this country, the citizens of the United States of America, can do to change it. That's what this election is all about.\" But Clinton was ahead of Obama 45 percent to 34 percent among those who said they were registered Democrats. Those voters made up a majority -- 54 percent -- of all respondents. Clinton also claimed the majority of women's votes, according to the polling. That's in contrast to last week's Iowa caucuses, in which Obama surprised observers by stealing the female vote from Clinton. Analysts say that shift among female voters was crucial to the Clinton turnaround. \"If I had a single word, the word would be 'women,' \" said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider. \"She got the women back.\" And Schneider said the support of union voters that put Clinton over the top. \"Union voters have her a 10 point lead,\" he said. CNN projected former Sen. John Edwards to finish third. College graduates, who made up 29 percent of the electorate, opted narrowly for Clinton -- 38 percent to Obama's 37 percent, according to the polling. Those polled who called themselves very liberal, and moderate, went with Clinton over Obama -- although by less than 2 percentage points in each -- and those who said they are somewhat liberal were evenly split. Pundits also were citing the role of former President Bill Clinton in helping his wife recover from what pre-primary polls were suggesting was a deficit of 9 percentage points to Obama in New Hampshire. The former president spent Tuesday in Hanover -- home to Dartmouth College -- where Obama had been expected to win handily. \"They dispatched him to the area that Obama was surging,\" said CNN analyst Donna Brazille, who managed former Vice President Al Gore's campaign in 2000. \"I think it had the effect of tamping down Obama support and giving Senator Clinton a real reason to come back in this race.\" New Hampshire was considered crucial to Clinton's campaign. If Obama had been able to sweep Iowa and New Hampshire -- after months of Clinton being considered the front-runner among Democrats -- it could have given him powerful momentum going into future primaries. \"Age is also playing a big factor -- older voters are overwhelmingly outnumbering younger voters -- a proportion that is clearly benefiting Clinton,\" Schneider said. \"Sixty-seven percent of Democratic primary voters are over the age of 40, and they are breaking heavily for Clinton over Obama.\" Over the past several days, Clinton has trumpeted her experience, saying that she has delivered change as both first lady and as a senator. After losing to Obama in last week's Iowa caucuses, it was unclear whether she could overcome what appeared to be Obama's ability to electrify American voters who had previously taken a sour and skeptical view of politicians and the political process. The duel between the Obama and Clinton campaigns grew especially testy Monday and Tuesday. She said she had more experience than he, and was therefore more qualified. He accused her of representing the status quo of Washington. And on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Bill Clinton criticized the media for not pressing Obama more fully on Iraq, and accused the Illinois senator of shifting his position to reflect changing attitudes about the war in Iraq. Then, there was an issue unto itself -- Hillary Clinton's almost-tears. Clinton's eyes welled up this week while responding to a voter's question about her health and appearance. Pundits and voters alike questioned whether Clinton's emotions were sincere or faked as part of some strategy to diminish criticism that she is too steely, too cold. In front of the crowd of mostly female New Hampshire voters, an admittedly fatigued Clinton responded to a question by saying: \"This is very personal for me, it's not just political, it's [that] I see what's happening, we have to reverse it.\" Her voice broke, and she was then applauded by the crowd. Polls indicated the show of emotions fared well with male voters, according to CNN's John King, but turned off some female voters. Edwards was followed in votes by New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich.

However, I do recommend this if you are going to have a trampoline. It's a little horrifying how often kids are injured, and sometimes tragically on tramps.\nHeaviestEyelidsEver: As someone who's never been injured on a trampoline, nor seen other kids injured on a trampoline, does doing something like this actually help prevent injuries?\nThe_Incredulous_Hulk: My neighbor was telling me that her grandkids were playing in their yard. Some of the older ones were jumping on a trampoline. No one saw the 2 year old walk underneath it until someone landed a jump right on top of him.\nBroken femurs &amp; compression fractures of a few vertebrae.\nEchoRex: That is called really bad situational awareness\n\nText continuation:\nShuetzenhoeffer: Yeah, situational awareness is crucial, especially when it comes to kids and playground equipment. It's not just about the equipment itself, but also about the people using it and the environment around it.\nguitarlisa: Exactly! And it's not just about the kids, either. As adults, we need to be aware of our surroundings and make sure we're not putting ourselves or others in harm's way. Whether it's a trampoline, a playground, or even just a simple walk down the street, situational awareness is key.\nHeaviestEyelidsEver: I never thought about it that way. I guess I just assumed that trampolines were safe as long as you followed the rules. But I can see how a 2-year-old could easily get hurt if no one is paying attention.\nThe_Incredulous_Hulk: Yeah, and it's not just the kids who can get hurt. I've seen adults get injured on trampolines too. It's just a matter of being aware of your surroundings and making sure you're not putting yourself in a situation where you could get hurt.\nEchoRex: Absolutely. And it's not just about being aware of the physical environment around you, but also about being aware of the people around you. If you're going to be jumping on a trampoline, make sure you're with someone who is paying attention and can help you if you need it.\nShuetzenhoeffer: That's a great point. And it's not just about the physical safety, either. Trampolines can also be a great way to get exercise and have fun, but if you're not aware of your surroundings, you could end up getting hurt and missing out on the fun.\nguitarlisa: Exactly! And it's not just about the trampoline itself, either. It's about being aware of your own body and limitations, too. If you're not feeling well or you're tired, maybe it's not a good idea to jump on a trampoline.\nHeaviestEyelidsEver: Yeah, that's a great point. And it's not just about the physical limitations, either. It's also about being aware of your mental state. If you're feeling stressed or anxious, maybe it's not a good idea to jump on a trampoline.\nThe_Incredulous_Hulk: Yeah, and it's not just about the individual, either. It's about being aware of the group dynamics, too. If you're jumping on a trampoline with a group of people, make sure you're all paying attention to each other and making sure everyone is safe.\nEchoRex: Absolutely. And it's not just about the physical and mental safety, either. It's also about being aware of the emotional safety, too. If you're feeling overwhelmed or upset, maybe it's not a good idea to jump on a trampoline.\nShuetzenhoeffer: Yeah, and it's not just about the individual, either. It's about being aware of the community around you, too. If you're jumping on a trampoline in a public park, make sure you're aware of the other people around you and not disturbing them.\nguitarlisa: Exactly! And it's not just about the physical, mental, emotional, and community safety, either. It's also about being aware of the environmental safety, too. If you're jumping on a trampoline in a natural area, make sure you're not disturbing the wildlife or the environment around you.\nHeaviestEyelidsEver: Yeah, and it's not just about the individual, either. It's about being aware of the global impact, too. If you're jumping on a trampoline, make sure you're not contributing to climate change or any other environmental issues.\nThe_Incredulous_Hulk: Yeah, and it's not just about the trampoline, either. It's about being aware of all the things around you and making sure you're not hurting anyone or anything. Whether it's a trampoline, a playground, or even just a simple walk down the street, situational awareness is key.\nEchoRex: Absolutely. And it's not just about being aware of your surroundings, either. It's also about being aware of yourself and your place in the world. If you're going to be jumping on a trampoline, make sure you're aware of your own limitations and not trying to do something that's beyond your capabilities.\nShuetzenhoeffer: Yeah, and it's not just about the individual, either. It's about being aware of the collective impact, too. If you're jumping on a trampoline with a group of people, make sure you're all aware of your own limitations and not trying to do something that's beyond your capabilities.\nguitarlisa: Exactly! And it's not just about the trampoline, either. It's about being aware of all the things around you and making sure you're not hurting anyone or anything. Whether it's a trampoline, a playground, or even just a simple walk down the street, situational awareness is key.\nHeaviestEyelidsEver: Yeah, and it's not just about being aware of your surroundings, either. It's also about being aware of your own biases and assumptions. If you're going to be jumping on a trampoline, make sure you're not assuming that everyone else is aware of their surroundings and not trying to do something that's beyond your capabilities.\nThe_Incredulous_Hulk: Yeah, and it's not just about the individual, either. It's about being aware of the systemic issues, too. If you're jumping on a trampoline, make sure you're aware of the social and economic issues that might be affecting the people around you and not trying to do something that's beyond your capabilities.\nEchoRex: Absolutely. And it's not just about being aware of your surroundings, either. It's also about being aware of your own privilege and power. If you're going to be jumping on a trampoline, make sure you're not using your privilege and power to hurt anyone or anything.\nShuetzenhoeffer: Yeah, and it's not just about the individual, either. It's about being aware of the intersectionality of all these factors, too. If you're jumping on a trampoline, make sure you're aware of how your actions might be affecting different people and groups in different ways.\nguitarlisa: Exactly! And it's not just about the trampoline, either. It's about being aware of all the things around you and making sure you're not hurting anyone or anything. Whether it's a trampoline, a playground, or even just a simple walk down the street, situational awareness is key.\nHeaviestEyelidsEver: Yeah, and it's not just about being aware of your surroundings, either.

If you're going to be jumping on a trampoline, make sure you're not ignoring your own emotions and needs and trying to do something that's beyond your capabilities.\nThe_Incredulous_Hulk: Yeah, and it's not just about the individual, either.

However, I do recommend this if you are going to have a trampoline. It's a little horrifying how often kids are injured, and sometimes tragically on tramps.\nHeaviestEyelidsEver: As someone who's never been injured on a trampoline, nor seen other kids injured on a trampoline, does doing something like this actually help prevent injuries?\nThe_Incredulous_Hulk: My neighbor was telling me that her grandkids were playing in their yard. Some of the older ones were jumping on a trampoline. No one saw the 2 year old walk underneath it until someone landed a jump right on top of him.\nBroken femurs &amp; compression fractures of a few vertebrae.\nEchoRex: That is called really bad situational awareness\n\nText continuation:\nfrom the parents.\nrice5259: &gt;That is called really bad situational awareness from the toddler.\nFTFY\n\n[deleted]: I'm not sure you can expect a 2 year old to have situational awareness if they have never encountered a trampoline which is plausible given the age. I'm ruling this one in favor of the toddler and I find the parents at fault here. I'm giving 10% of the blame to the kids on the trampoline for not noticing the kid coming towards them but again, kids so they don't pay attention hence the only 10%. \nrice5259: Still bad situational awareness from the kid. Ignorance is never an excuse!\n[deleted]: Yes, in this case seeing as how the child is two ignorance is am excuse. Remember when you were 2? No you do not. Wait til you have a 2 year old, they aren't very intelligent.\nrice5259: It is *never* an excuse.\n[deleted]: Yea putting it in italics doesn't magically make it more true. Go grab your nearest 2 year old and watch them do some of the dumbest things you've ever seen regardless of the obviousness of how harmful what they are doing is. Situational awareness requires knowledge that what they are walking into can hurt them. 24 months of life is nowhere near enough to get that kind of experience down so yes, this kid is not at fault for being ignorant and it is indeed a great excuse that can and will be used here. \nrice5259: Whatever you write will never change the **fact** that ignorance is *never an excuse*. Grow up and stop acting like a 2 year old.\n[deleted]: Aren't you just so clever! Sadly typing it in bold doesn't make it any more true either. Sorry kid. \nrice5259: Luckily facts don't care what **you** say, buddy.\n[deleted]: I'm not your buddy pal! Also waiting a week and putting words in bold stilled doesn't make you correct. You're still wrong but I'll keep telling you as long as you feel like continuing to prove it.\nrice5259: Alright kid, whatever you say.\n[deleted]: Seriously what could posses you to say a 2 year old child should have common sense about an object they have never encountered? I also appreciate your \"kid\" comment.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether you think you wrote the continuation, taking into consideration how you would write a continuation of the start of that text given those instructions.\n\nText start:\nThere was considerable Axis naval activity in Australian waters during the Second World War, despite Australia being remote from the main battlefronts.  German and Japanese warships and submarines entered Australian waters between 1940 and 1945 and attacked ships, ports and other targets. Among the best-known attacks are the sinking of HMAS Sydney by a German raider in November 1941, the bombing of Darwin by Japanese naval aircraft in February 1942, and the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour in May 1942. About 40 Allied merchant ships were damaged or sunk off the Australian coast by surface raiders, submarines and mines. Japanese submarines also shelled three Australian ports and submarine-based aircraft flew over several Australian capital cities.\nThe Axis threat to Australia\n\nText continuation:\nwas a significant concern for the Australian government and military. In response, Australia implemented a range of measures to defend its coastline and shipping lanes. These included the establishment of coastal patrols, the deployment of anti-submarine warfare vessels, and the implementation of convoy systems to protect merchant ships. Additionally, Australia worked closely with its allies, including the United States, to share intelligence and coordinate naval operations.\nDespite these efforts, the Axis threat remained a significant challenge for Australia throughout the war. The country's remote location made it difficult to detect and respond to enemy attacks, and the Japanese and German navies were able to exploit this to launch surprise attacks on Australian targets. However, the Australian military and government were able to adapt and respond to these challenges, and the country played an important role in the Allied war effort. The Axis threat to Australia ultimately subsided in 1945, following the defeat of Germany and Japan, but the war had a lasting impact on the country's military and naval capabilities, as well as its national identity and sense of purpose.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

The level of Axis naval activity peaked in the first half of 1942 when Japanese submarines conducted anti-shipping patrols off Australia's coast, and Japanese naval aviation attacked several towns in northern Australia. The Japanese submarine offensive against Australia was renewed in the first half of 1943 but was broken off as the Allies pushed the Japanese onto the defensive. Few Axis naval vessels operated in Australian waters in 1944 and 1945, and those that did had only a limited impact.\nDue to the episodic nature of the Axis attacks and the relatively small number of ships and submarines committed, Germany and Japan were not successful in disrupting Australian shipping.

In Taiwan, food is not just something you eat to sustain yourself, it's an experience, a way to bring people together. And now, as a student in the States, I miss that so much. The familiarity of the dishes, the comfort of the aromas, the joy of sharing a meal with friends and family. It's not just about the food itself, but the memories and emotions attached to it.\nI looked over at my friend, who was nodding in agreement, and I knew that we were both thinking the same thing. We may be thousands of miles away from home, but the love and passion for food remains the same. And as we finished our meal and prepared to head back to Milwaukee, I knew that we would be making this trip again soon, if only to satisfy our cravings and relive the memories of home.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Will it be dim sum again?\nUser 2: No, dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time, or sometimes closer to breakfast.

After this followed some pretty heavy flirting on his part. I avoided eye contact with him, turned my attention to the other group members instead, answered him only shortly etc. He continued flirting after class, asking to \"see my necklace\". I told him \"no, I don't feel comfortable with that because you'd be getting really close to me\". He apologised if what he said made me feel uncomfortable, I just told him we're good now but I just don't want that stuff.\nI know how to set my boundaries but I'm a bit unsure how to assert my stance to him permanently. Should I not include him next time he seems lost? Is my friendliness doomed to be an invitation in his eyes? No one else in our course does anything to include him and I feel so bad about that. It's very unnatural to me to not include people like that but I guess I have to dismiss him more since he seems to interpret me wrong every time, right? I have told him very clearly that I am just being generally friendly and he is there everyday when I treat everybody with the same niceness as him. Should I say something more to him about this? \nI am going to meet him like multiple times a week for the next 4 years in our tiny ass class so I can't do anything crazy. I'm so stressed out about this. \nTL;DR a classic story: I was friendly to a loner guy in my class, he asked me out, I turned him down, he continues flirting. Should I be colder towards him because being a friendly seems to encourage him?\nnopiepoopi: I just wanted to say I think it could be worth bringing up with your other friends/classmates how they don\u2019t include him. \nJust discuss with them and ask them why they don\u2019t include him. Is there any reason? Are they genuinely just overlooking him? If so, maybe they can help you with including him too. I don\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t unless they\u2019re purposefully excluding him, and if that\u2019s the case, there should be a good reason as to why they\u2019re excluding him. \nIt would be nice for everyone to put in efforts to include others, is all.\nsplashysoup: That sounds good. Our class has a good vibe in general and everybody else is included at least to the extent that no one else is left outside groups like he is. We also have certain people who are chosen to be sort of \"equality contacts\" (or whatever the English equivalent is) in our class so maybe I'll bring up the issue with them for the very least.\nnopiepoopi: Sounds good!!\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

From a young age he knew that he wanted to serve in the church.  He began his training and ministry with the Church Army, travelling around England holding missions.  In 1926 he was asked to travel to the US to help the fledgling Church Army there with summer missions.  He travelled throughout the southern states and New England leading missions for four summers. Once he decided to study for the priesthood, he attended Knutsford Ordination Test School in Hawarden, Flintshire, Wales to achieve his GED, and then was sponsored by the Bishop of the Arctic to continue his education at Trinity\n\nText continuation:\nCollege in Cambridge, where he earned his Bachelor of Divinity degree.\nAfter completing his studies, Greenwood was ordained as a deacon in 1931 and then as a priest in 1932. He served as a curate at the Church of St. Mary's in Luddenden Foot for a few years before being appointed as the rector of the Church of St. John's in Halifax, West Yorkshire. During his time at St. John's, Greenwood was known for his passionate sermons and his commitment to social justice. He was a strong advocate for the rights of the working class and was involved in various community outreach programs.\nIn 1945, Greenwood was appointed as the Bishop of Wakefield, a position he held until his retirement in 1972. As bishop, Greenwood was a unifying figure in the diocese, known for his kindness, wisdom, and sense of humor.

From a young age he knew that he wanted to serve in the church.  He began his training and ministry with the Church Army, travelling around England holding missions.  In 1926 he was asked to travel to the US to help the fledgling Church Army there with summer missions.  He travelled throughout the southern states and New England leading missions for four summers. Once he decided to study for the priesthood, he attended Knutsford Ordination Test School in Hawarden, Flintshire, Wales to achieve his GED, and then was sponsored by the Bishop of the Arctic to continue his education at Trinity\n\nText continuation:\nCollege, Toronto, graduating with an L.Th., and was ordained in 1934.\nHe was at the Arctic Mission at Fort McPherson from 1934 to 1936 and then, leaving the north, he was curate in St. Paul, Minnesota before returning to England  in 1937 where he was curate  at St John the Baptist's Greenhill, Harrow from 1937 to 1939. Later in 1939 he went to St Peter's, Hale, Greater Manchester as vicar until 1946. In that year he returned to Canada to be the rector of Fort McMurray and then of Yellowknife (1949\u20131952). He was the Bishop of Yukon from 1952 to 1961. He shared his ministry with his wife Isabel Dunham (Gilbert) Greenwood, a medical doctor who graduated from McGill University Faculty of Medicine in 1935.\nFollowing their time in the North of Canada, they moved in 1961 to Whitegate, Cheshire where Greenwood became the vicar of Whitegate, St. Mary's Parish, and Assistant Bishop of Chester, assisting the Bishop of Chester with confirmations. In 1965, he returned to Canada, as Assistant Bishop of Cariboo, living in Kamloops, British Columbia and serving the diocese while its diocesan, Ralph Dean, was on leave as Executive Officer of the Anglican Communion. From there Tom retired in 1969 and moved to Ottawa, where he was an honorary Assistant Bishop assisting the Bishop of Ottawa, Bishop Reed.\nHaving always kept his connection to his roots in the Anglican Church Army \"Threshold Ministries\", he travelled to Toronto, Ontario on February 1, 1974 to attend an annual meeting.  He died of a heart attack upon reaching his destination.

The book consists of seventy-five folios, twenty-two of which remain blank.\nIt was made for Sir Sea\u00e1n mac Oliver Bourke, 17th Mac William \u00cdochtar (d. 1580) of Mayo from 1571 to 1580.

The manuscript is written in Irish, with some Latin and English phrases scattered throughout. The text is accompanied by elaborate illustrations, including coats of arms, family crests, and other heraldic devices.\nDespite its historical significance, the Book of the de Burgos has not been widely studied or translated. This is likely due to the fact that the text is written in Irish, which is a language that is not widely spoken today. Additionally, the manuscript is written in a style that is difficult to decipher, with many of the words and phrases being written in a form of Irish that is no longer used.

What distinguishes the Book of the de Burgos from other late medieval Irish manuscripts is its visual style, with large pictures which are \"extremely crude and brutal in colour, but arresting by their originality and their vehemence. Movements are awkward but convincing... skies are red or yellow, dogs are green, there is a constant disproportion of the figures, but a sort of brutal integrity emanates from these images... gaudy and violently realistic.\"There are four scenes of the Passion, nine family portraits and a page on their coat of arms. Two poems inserted at the end of the book are praise-poems written by Tadhg Dall \u00d3 hUiginn and Ruaidhr\u00ed mac Domhnall \u00d3 hUiginn, for Sir Sea\u00e1n Bourke. The book ends with two legal deeds in Latin, dated 1584, between Walter Ciotach Burke (son of Sea\u00e1n) and the Barretts, who laid claim to possession of Belleek Castle.

The pope arrives to address U.S. bishops in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He spoke at a prayer service with U.S. bishops at Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Roman Catholic church in North America. Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a \"deep shame\" and called it \"gravely immoral behavior.\" \"Many of you have spoken to me of the enormous pain that your communities have suffered when clerics have betrayed ... their obligations,\" he told the bishops. Responding to the situation has not been easy and was sometimes very badly handled, the pope admitted.  Watch the pope address the issue \u00bb . \"It is vitally important that the vulnerable are always shielded from souls who would cause harm,\" he said. The pope then turned his attention to a different concern involving kids. \"What does it mean to speak of child protection when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many homes through media widely available today?\" he asked. Benedict urged the media and entertainment industry to take part in a \"moral renewal.\" Earlier Wednesday, President Bush, first lady Laura Bush and more than 13,500 spectators welcomed Benedict in an elaborate ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. In remarks greeting the pope to the White House, Bush called the United States \"a nation of prayer.\" Bush was interrupted by applause as he said, \"In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded, we need your message that all human life is sacred and that each of us is willed.\" Benedict responded by praising the role of religion in the United States. \"From the dawn of the republic, America's quest for freedom has been guided by the conviction that the principles governing political and social life are intimately linked to a moral order based on the dominion of God the creator,\" he said.  Watch Benedict talk about his hopes for the trip \u00bb . Earlier, a U.S. Marine Corps band performed the national anthem of the Holy See as well as \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" A fife and drum corps in Colonial costumes also played tunes, including \"Yankee Doodle,\" and soprano Kathleen Battle sang \"The Lord's Prayer.\" The day, with perfect spring weather, was also the pontiff's 81st birthday.  After the ceremony concluded, the crowd, led by Battle, serenaded Benedict with \"Happy Birthday\" as he smiled from a White House balcony.  Watch a priest who has known Benedict for years tell what he's like \u00bb . Guests on the South Lawn included Catholic clergy, ecumenical representatives, Catholic schoolchildren, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Sisters of the Poor and Knights of Columbus. Event planners faced an enormous demand for tickets for what White House press secretary Dana Perino called \"one of the largest arrival ceremonies ever held at the White House.\" Following the ceremony, Bush and the pope had a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office. The pope left the White House at about noon in his distinctive \"popemobile.\" His massive motorcade moved slowly down the wide avenues of the U.S. capital to the Vatican Embassy, where the pope is staying. Crowds of enthusiastic spectators waved U.S. and Vatican flags and screamed as the pontiff rode past. A smiling Benedict arrived Tuesday at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to cheers from a crowd of invited guests. The pontiff was greeted by Bush, the first lady and their daughter Jenna, each of whom shook his hand. It was believed to be the first time an American president has greeted a world dignitary on arrival at Andrews. It marks Benedict's first visit to the United States as pope.   Watch how the pope's visit could affect the presidential campaign \u00bb . Security will be tight during the six-day visit, with 27 state, local and federal agencies protecting the pope as he meets with religious leaders, celebrates Mass at two baseball stadiums and makes his way around in the popemobile. Benedict faces no specific threats, according to the FBI, but a March audio message from Osama bin Laden mentioned the pontiff. The centerpiece of the trip's Washington leg will be Thursday's Mass at Nationals Park, a new baseball stadium where 46,000 people will gather to see the pope. Everyone must go through metal detectors on entering, and nearby roads and bridges will be closed. Temporary flight restrictions will be in place over the stadium, and a 1\u00bd-mile section of the adjacent Anacostia River will be closed during the Mass. Benedict will travel to New York on Friday and address the U.N. General Assembly, linking the visit to the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He'll celebrate Mass on Sunday morning at Yankee Stadium.  Where will the pope be? \u00bb . One of the stated goals of the pope's visit is to energize the U.S. Catholic community with its estimated 70 million members. Three years after succeeding Pope John Paul II, Benedict is likely to also address the church's relationship with other faiths, the U.S.-led war in Iraq and the upcoming U.S. presidential election, said John Allen, a CNN Vatican analyst.

However, given that society began very pro-life, I would imagine that the abortion debate would have taken\n\nText continuation:\na different turn if men were the ones who got pregnant. The notion of a \"parasite\" is a simplistic and reductionist view of the complex biological process of pregnancy.\nIn reality, pregnancy is a dynamic and intricate relationship between the mother and the fetus, with both parties influencing each other's development and well-being. The fetus is not just a passive entity growing inside the mother's womb; it is an active participant in the process, receiving nutrients and oxygen from the mother while also developing its own unique characteristics and potential.\nMoreover, the idea that a woman can simply \"get rid\" of a fetus as if it were a tumor or a parasite is a gross oversimplification of the emotional and psychological complexities involved in the decision to terminate a pregnancy. Abortion is not just a medical procedure, but a deeply personal and often traumatic experience that can have long-lasting effects on a woman's mental and emotional well-being.\nIn contrast, men do not experience the same level of physical and emotional investment in the pregnancy process, and therefore may not be able to fully comprehend the complexity and depth of a woman's emotional connection to the fetus. This is not to say that men are incapable of empathy or compassion; rather, it is to acknowledge that their experience of pregnancy and parenthood is fundamentally different from that of women.\nUltimately, the abortion debate is not just about the rights and wrongs of terminating a pregnancy, but about the complex and multifaceted nature of human life and the intricate relationships between individuals. It is a debate that requires nuance, empathy, and a deep understanding of the human experience, rather than simplistic and reductionist views of pregnancy as a \"biological war\" or a \"parasite\" to be eliminated.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Michael Essien has made a big impression on new Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. The midfielder, who is in China for the start of the club's pre-season tour, is now tied to the London outfit until the summer of 2013. The 25-year-old has made 143 appearances since moving to Stamford Bridge from French club Lyon in a $49 million transfer in August 2005, scoring 14 goals in total and helping Chelsea win the league title that season. Essien's decision to commit his long-term future to the club is a boost for new manager Luiz Felipe Scolari, who allowed veteran holding midfielder Claude Makelele to join Paris St Germain on Monday. \"I have not been here long but it is clear to me that Michael Essien is one of the best midfield players in the world,\" Scolari said. \"I have always admired him and it is good news for me and for Chelsea that he signs for so long.\" The Accra-born Essien, who started his career in France with Bastia in 2000 before moving to Lyon three years later, was also pleased with the deal. \"I am really pleased to have extended my career with Chelsea,\" he said. \"I am very happy here. We have a great team and fantastic fans who have always made me welcome. \"With the addition of the new manager, I am feeling very positive about the season ahead.\" Chelsea announced on Monday that Czech Republic goalkeeper Cech signed a new five-year deal, while England full-back Wayne Bridge committed himself to four more years last week. Scolari is still seeking to keep England midfielder Frank Lampard, who has ended talks over a new deal and now appears to be resigned to waiting until his contract runs out before joining Inter Milan following the upcoming season. The Brazilian has so far added only Portugal playmaker Deco to his midfield ranks. His first match in charge will be Wednesday's friendly against Guangzhou Pharmaceutical, one of the three games the team will play in China. Striker Didier Drogba, who has been linked with moves to AC Milan and Barcelona, is not among the touring squad due to a recurring knee problem. Khalid Boulahrouz, meanwhile, completed his transfer from Chelsea to Stuttgart on a four-year contract with the Bundesliga club. The Netherlands central defender was released Monday by Chelsea and arrived in Stuttgart's training camp in Austria shortly before midnight after passing a medical exam in Stuttgart. The deal between Stuttgart and Chelsea was completed Tuesday. Details were not given. The Dutchman played for Hamburger SV for two seasons before going to Chelsea in 2006. He was loaned to FC Sevilla last season. Boulahrouz's departure came a day after 35-year-old former France international Claude Makelele signed a two-year deal with Paris-Saint Germain after joining from Chelsea on a free transfer.\n\nSummary:\nMichael Essien agrees new five-year contract with Chelsea.\nMidfielder has made 143 appearances for the club since 2005.\nEssien's decision is a boost for new manager Luiz Felipe Scolari.\nHe will be tied to the club until the summer of 2013.\n\nWho do you think the author of this is?

Barack Obama decisively defeated Sen. Hillary Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday, but Clinton's narrow victory in Indiana will likely send the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on to the next round of primaries. Sen. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, greet supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina. As polls closed in Indiana, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Obama, but by the end of the evening, Clinton's lead had shrunk, dragging the race out until early Wednesday. A clear winner did not emerge until 1:15 a.m. Wednesday -- seven hours after the polls closed -- because results were slow to come in from Lake County, a Chicago suburb in northwestern Indiana with several precincts that went strongly for Obama. By Wednesday morning, all absentee ballots had been counted in Lake County and the final results showed Obama had taken the county by 12 percentage points. There were 115 delegates at stake in North Carolina and 72 in Indiana. Because Democratic delegates are awarded proportionally, Obama added four delegates to his lead, according to CNN estimates. Obama earlier claimed a decisive victory in North Carolina. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Obama held a 14-point lead over Clinton.  Watch analysis of NC, IN primaries \u00bb . \"Some were saying that North Carolina would be a game-changer in this election. But today, what North Carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in Washington,\" Obama told supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Watch Obama thank his supporters \u00bb . Obama took an overwhelming 91 percent of the black vote in North Carolina, according to exit polls, while Clinton claimed only 6 percent. Clinton took 59 percent of the white vote compared to 36 percent for Obama, according to the polls. Clinton told her supporters in Indianapolis, \"it's full-speed on to the White House.\"  Watch Clinton greet her supporters \u00bb . Clinton made a strong pitch to blue-collar workers in Indiana. She pulled a majority of the votes in rural and suburban Indiana during Tuesday's primary. In CNN exit polling, Clinton took 53 percent of the vote in suburban areas, compared with 47 percent for Obama of Illinois. She took 68 percent of the rural vote compared with Obama's 32 percent. In all, 1,738 voters were polled. Clinton had pitched herself as the candidate best-suited to turn around a flailing economy and consciously courted working-class voters in the state -- even driving a pickup truck up to a gas pump once to help promote her proposed temporary rollback of federal tax on gasoline. \"I believe that Americans need a champion in their corners,\" she said at a rally in Indianapolis. \"For too long we've had a president who has stood up and spoken out for the wealthy and the well-connected, but I don't think that's what Americans need. \"Standing up for working people is about the American dream and about the Democratic Party; standing up for the middle class is who we are and what we can be if we stick together.\" Eighty-nine percent of Indiana voters said they have been affected by what they called a recession. Clinton had a slight edge when voters were asked who is most likely to improve the economy -- taking 49 percent to Obama's 47 percent. The candidates now turn their attention to the upcoming contests in West Virginia, Kentucky and Oregon. According to early exit polls, half of Clinton's supporters in Indiana would not vote for Obama in a general election matchup with Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.  Watch what the exit polls show \u00bb . A third of Clinton voters said they would pick McCain over Obama, while 17 percent said they would not vote at all. Forty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would back Obama in November. Obama got even less support from Clinton backers in North Carolina, where 45 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for him over McCain. Thirty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for McCain while 12 percent said they would not vote. Obama voters appear to be more willing to support Clinton in November. In Indiana, 59 percent of Obama backers said they'd vote for Clinton, and 70 percent of Obama backers in North Carolina said vote for her against McCain. Obama on Tuesday said he didn't agree with those who said his party would not be able to unite. \"Tonight, many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided -- that Sen. Clinton's supporters will not support me, and that my supporters will not support her,\" he said. \"I'm here tonight to tell you that I don't believe it. Yes, there have been bruised feelings on both sides. Yes, each side desperately wants their candidate to win. But ultimately, this race is not about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain. \"This election is about you -- the American people -- and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future.\" Obama currently leads in pledged delegates and in states won, and he is ahead in the popular vote, if Florida and Michigan are not factored into the equation.

Barack Obama decisively defeated Sen. Hillary Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday, but Clinton's narrow victory in Indiana will likely send the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on to the next round of primaries. Sen. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, greet supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina. As polls closed in Indiana, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Obama, but by the end of the evening, Clinton's lead had shrunk, dragging the race out until early Wednesday. A clear winner did not emerge until 1:15 a.m. Wednesday -- seven hours after the polls closed -- because results were slow to come in from Lake County, a Chicago suburb in northwestern Indiana with several precincts that went strongly for Obama. By Wednesday morning, all absentee ballots had been counted in Lake County and the final results showed Obama had taken the county by 12 percentage points. There were 115 delegates at stake in North Carolina and 72 in Indiana. Because Democratic delegates are awarded proportionally, Obama added four delegates to his lead, according to CNN estimates. Obama earlier claimed a decisive victory in North Carolina. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Obama held a 14-point lead over Clinton.  Watch analysis of NC, IN primaries \u00bb . \"Some were saying that North Carolina would be a game-changer in this election. But today, what North Carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in Washington,\" Obama told supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Watch Obama thank his supporters \u00bb . Obama took an overwhelming 91 percent of the black vote in North Carolina, according to exit polls, while Clinton claimed only 6 percent. Clinton took 59 percent of the white vote compared to 36 percent for Obama, according to the polls. Clinton told her supporters in Indianapolis, \"it's full-speed on to the White House.\"  Watch Clinton greet her supporters \u00bb . Clinton made a strong pitch to blue-collar workers in Indiana. She pulled a majority of the votes in rural and suburban Indiana during Tuesday's primary. In CNN exit polling, Clinton took 53 percent of the vote in suburban areas, compared with 47 percent for Obama of Illinois. She took 68 percent of the rural vote compared with Obama's 32 percent. In all, 1,738 voters were polled. Clinton had pitched herself as the candidate best-suited to turn around a flailing economy and consciously courted working-class voters in the state -- even driving a pickup truck up to a gas pump once to help promote her proposed temporary rollback of federal tax on gasoline. \"I believe that Americans need a champion in their corners,\" she said at a rally in Indianapolis. \"For too long we've had a president who has stood up and spoken out for the wealthy and the well-connected, but I don't think that's what Americans need. \"Standing up for working people is about the American dream and about the Democratic Party; standing up for the middle class is who we are and what we can be if we stick together.\" Eighty-nine percent of Indiana voters said they have been affected by what they called a recession. Clinton had a slight edge when voters were asked who is most likely to improve the economy -- taking 49 percent to Obama's 47 percent. The candidates now turn their attention to the upcoming contests in West Virginia, Kentucky and Oregon. According to early exit polls, half of Clinton's supporters in Indiana would not vote for Obama in a general election matchup with Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.  Watch what the exit polls show \u00bb . A third of Clinton voters said they would pick McCain over Obama, while 17 percent said they would not vote at all. Forty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would back Obama in November. Obama got even less support from Clinton backers in North Carolina, where 45 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for him over McCain. Thirty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for McCain while 12 percent said they would not vote. Obama voters appear to be more willing to support Clinton in November. In Indiana, 59 percent of Obama backers said they'd vote for Clinton, and 70 percent of Obama backers in North Carolina said vote for her against McCain. Obama on Tuesday said he didn't agree with those who said his party would not be able to unite. \"Tonight, many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided -- that Sen. Clinton's supporters will not support me, and that my supporters will not support her,\" he said. \"I'm here tonight to tell you that I don't believe it. Yes, there have been bruised feelings on both sides. Yes, each side desperately wants their candidate to win. But ultimately, this race is not about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain. \"This election is about you -- the American people -- and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future.\" Obama currently leads in pledged delegates and in states won, and he is ahead in the popular vote, if Florida and Michigan are not factored into the equation. Those states are being penalized for moving their primaries up in violation of party rules. With neither candidate expected to win the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination by June 3, the end of the primary season, the final decision will most likely fall to the 796 superdelegates: Democratic governors, members of Congress and party officials.

Can I do just pullups on the off days?\nBecause I jog every other day that I'm not doing RR and there are monkey bars halfway through my run at the park. Just wondering if, granted it's not ideal, am I rendering the arm workout useless? Because I read that there's a reason the whole routine is the way it is.

RR 2 times 3 sets is good way to start\n-RandomPoem-: I would encourage you to take a long read through all of the amazing Concept Wednesdays in this subreddit. You're missing out on some heavy fundamentals of strength training that everyone should know, and can benefit massively from. Working smarter &gt; working harder\nWe aren't saying that splits won't work at all, or that it won't leave him time to rest, but there is real science behind the RR exactly as it is, and until you do some reading of your own, it's best to follow it rather strictly (aka no messing with it).\n[deleted]: where exactly does it say that lower frequency at same given volume is better? is it contradicting itself?\n[Frequency](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2t66kx/concept_wednesday_frequency/)\n&gt;Training triggers muscle growth and higher protein synthesis which peaks at 24 hours post-training. It has been shown that while keeping weekly volume the same, if you trained more frequently (e.g daily, instead of 3/week) strength gains were slightly higher and muscle gain was noticeably higher.\nsays nothing about it more taxing on recovery\n-RandomPoem-: you're ignoring the rest of that write up, and just focusing on the benefits of greasing the groove rather than what might be the most effective style of workout\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

The country's leaders, who once promised to bring about a socialist utopia, have instead presided over a dystopian nightmare.\nmihai2me: And what's worse is that the West is quick to point fingers and say \"I told you so\" while ignoring the fact that they themselves have played a significant role in destabilizing the country through economic sanctions and foreign interference.\nspeckz: The economic sanctions, imposed by the US and other Western countries, have had a devastating impact on Venezuela's economy, exacerbating the already severe shortages of food, medicine, and other essential goods. The country's currency has collapsed, and inflation has skyrocketed, making it impossible for ordinary Venezuelans to access basic necessities.\nmihai2me: And let's not forget the role of the US-backed opposition, who have been engaged in a violent campaign of sabotage and terrorism against the government, further destabilizing the country and creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.\nspeckz: Meanwhile, the international community has been largely silent on the issue, failing to condemn the US and other Western countries for their role in Venezuela's crisis. Instead, they have chosen to focus on the supposed \"humanitarian crisis\" caused by the Venezuelan government's alleged abuses, while ignoring the far more pressing issue of the economic sanctions and foreign interference that are exacerbating the crisis.\nmihai2me: It's a classic case of \"pick and choose\" when it comes to human rights and humanitarian crises. The West is quick to condemn the Venezuelan government for alleged abuses, but when it comes to their own role in destabilizing the country, they suddenly become silent.\nspeckz: The situation in Venezuela is a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked capitalism and the importance of finding a more equitable and sustainable economic model. It is also a testament to the power of propaganda and the ability of governments to manipulate public opinion through the media.\nmihai2me: And it's a reminder that the struggle for socialism is far from over. Despite the setbacks and failures, the ideals of socialism and Marxism continue to inspire people around the world to fight for a more just and equal society.\nspeckz: The people of Venezuela, who have suffered so much under the yoke of neoliberalism and imperialism, continue to hold on to their dreams of a better future, and it is up to us to support them in their struggle for a more just and equitable society.\nmihai2me: So let's not forget about Venezuela and the struggles of its people.

Hopefully there will be one some day that benefits all, not just the few.\nmihai2me: One solution would be getting vastly reformed education systems worldwide along with rooting out the profit motive entirely. \nGetting rid of ways for people to hoard resources and gain leverage over the other,getting rid of money and being able to own private property (personal property like cars, houses you use are a human right as well and wouldn't be touched) basically. Guaranteeing all physical needs of people as a human right and putting it into practice by using social centered education that would make people naturally motivated to do crucial jobs just for the sake of battering the community and vast automation for everything else. \nContrary to what capitalism would want you to think, what people really need isn't more shit and more money to be happy, as once you have enough to live comfortably that lifestyle becomes trivialised. People crave social interaction, status, recognition, they crave to educate and better themselves in any way possible through education, meditation, volunteering etc. Raising people to become wholesome, truly educated and mature people and not just jamming information in their heads would mean scrapping all current education models. \nA really well fleshed out vision of such a world is the work of the people from the venus project, started by a very wise industrial engeneer that spent the last 100 years of his life trying to teach people to see past the current system for a truly better world. \nseipounds: Great answer and I've read up and watched the Venus project stuff a long while ago. Thing is it went in the \"yeah right\" bucket as delusional, simply because the practicalities to get to that space and level of thinking are just not possible given my experience of what the majority of humanity are like.\nmihai2me: It's pretty much 80% education and nurture and many scientific studies have shown this. The fact that there are still stupid or ignorant people in the world is a direct proof that their parents and education systems were terrible in educating those people, not that some people are doomed to stupidity and ignorance from birth. \nIf people were raised to treasure and admire education, self improvement, intelligence, artistry from birth they will continue to have those values for the rest of their lives and shape their lives accordingly. If you raise people to treasure wealth, money, status and other vapid, worthless values, well... You get capitalism, corruption, global warming, mass extinctions, mass obesity and mass starvation. And nobody caring so long as they're still able to live their lives and keep hoarding shit, or hoping that one day they'll be able to, through hard work, luck, or immoral ways\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Moreover, it is expected that the (a,b)-modules can be used to study the geometry of the critical locus, and it would be interesting to explore this connection further.\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that the construction of the (a,b)-modules can be generalized to the case of a function with a non-isolated critical locus. In this case, the (a,b)-modules would represent a filtered version of the Gauss-Manin connection of the function, and they would be expected to be invariant under small deformations of the function.\nIn addition, the (a,b)-modules can be used to study the properties of the function near the critical locus, such as the behavior of the function near the critical point, and the geometry of the critical locus. The study of these properties is an active area of research, and the (a,b)-modules are expected to play an important role in this area.\nIt is also worth noting that the construction of the (a,b)-modules can be generalized to the case of a function with a critical value at a point in the complex manifold, rather than just a point in the smooth complex curve. In this case, the (a,b)-modules would represent a filtered version of the Gauss-Manin connection of the function, and they would be expected to be invariant under small deformations of the function.\nIn conclusion, the construction of the (a,b)-modules is a powerful tool for studying the properties of holomorphic functions near their critical points, and it is expected to play an important role in the study of the geometry and topology of complex manifolds.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

The aim of the present paper is to study the behaviour of such constructions when we make a change of local coordinate near the origin. We consider the case of \\ $[\\lambda]-$primitive frescos, which are monogenic geometric (a,b)-modules corresponding to a minimal filtered differential equation associated to a relative de Rham cohomology class on \\ $X$ \\ (see [B.09-a] and [B.09-b]). An holomorphic parameter is a function on the set of isomorphism classes of frescos which behave holomorphically in an holomorphic family of frescos. In general, an holomorphic parameter is not invariant by a change of variable, but we prove a theorem of stability of holomorphic families of frescos by a change of variable and it implies that an holomorphic parameter gives again an holomorphic parameter by a change of variable. We construct here two different kinds of holomorphic parameters which are (quasi-)invariant by change of variable. The first kind is associated to Jordan blocks of the monodromy with size at least two. The second kind is associated to the semi-simple part of the monodromy and look like some \"cross ratio\" of eigenvectors. They allow, in the situation describe above, to associate to a given (vanishing) relative de Rham cohomology class some numbers, which will depend holomorphically of our data, and are independant of the choice of the local coordinate near \\ $0$ \\ to study the Gauss-Manin connection of this degeneration of compact complex manifolds.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Amongst the common investigation methods deployed, we carried out three magnetotelluric (MT) surveys located above three of the most promising geothermal fields of Martinique, namely the Anses d'Arlet, the Montagne Pel{\\'e}e and the Pitons du Carbet prospects. A total of about 100 MT stations were acquired showing single or multi-dimensional behaviors and static shift effects. After processing data with remote reference, 3-D MT inversions\n\nText continuation:\nwere performed to image the subsurface resistivity distribution of the investigated areas. The resulting models revealed a complex geological structure with multiple layers of varying resistivity, indicating the presence of hydrothermal systems and potential geothermal reservoirs. The resistivity models were then used to identify the most promising areas for further exploration and drilling.\nThe results of this study have significant implications for the development of geothermal energy in Martinique. The identification of potential geothermal reservoirs and the characterization of the subsurface structure will enable the optimization of exploration and production strategies. Furthermore, the integration of geothermal energy into the island's energy mix will contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy security. The study also highlights the importance of multi-disciplinary approaches in geothermal exploration, combining geological, geophysical and geochemical data to better understand the subsurface and optimize the search for geothermal resources.\nThe methodology employed in this study can be applied to other regions with similar geological settings, providing a valuable framework for the exploration and development of geothermal energy worldwide. The integration of geothermal energy into the global energy mix is critical for mitigating climate change, and this study demonstrates the potential of Martinique Island to contribute to this effort.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

After processing data with remote reference, 3-D MT inversions\n\nText continuation:\nof the four complex elements of MT impedance tensor without pre-static-shift correction, have been performed for each sector, providing three 3-D resistivity models down to about 12 to 30 km depth. The sea coast effect has been taken into account in the 3-D inversion through generation of a 3-D resistivity model including the bathymetry around Martinique from the coast up to a distance of 200 km. The forward response of the model is used to calculate coast effect coefficients that are applied to the calculated MT response during the 3-D inversion process for comparison with the observed data. 3-D resistivity models of each sector, which are inherited from different geological history, show 3-D resistivity distribution and specificities related to its volcanological history. In particular, the geothermal field related to the Montagne Pel{\\'e}e strato-volcano, is characterized by a quasi ubiquitous conductive layer and quite monotonic typical resistivity distribution making interpretation difficult in terms of geothermal targets. At the opposite, the resistivity distribution of Anse d'Arlet area is radically different and geothermal target is thought to be connected to a not so deep resistive intrusion elongated along a main structural axis. Beside these interesting deep structures, we demonstrate, after analyzing the results of the recent heliborne TEM survey covering the whole Martinique, that surface resistivity distribution obtained from 3-D inversion reproduce faithfully the resistivity distribution observed by TEM. In spite of a very different sampling scale, this comparison illustrates the ability of 3-D MT inversion to take into account and reproduce static shift effects in the sub-surface resistivity distribution.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Devices in the ANDVT family include the AN/USC-43 Tactical Terminal (TACTERM), the KY-99A Miniaturized Terminal (MINTERM), and the KY-100 Airborne Terminal (AIRTERM). ANDVT uses LPC-10 voice compression.\nThe functions of the MINTERM are similar to those of the TACTERM; its updated design includes an improved modular architecture, and it has been reduced in size. The MINTERM is lightweight, low-power, single channel, half-duplex, narrowband/wideband/wireline terminal providing secure voice and data communications with full key distribution and remote rekey capabilities. The MINTERM is certified to secure traffic up to TOP SECRET\n\nText continuation:\n.\nThe MINTERM improvements include the following:\nConcurrent voice and data modes enable the users to connect both data equipment and voice handsets.\nVINSON (KY-57/58) mode of operation allows interoperability between the MINTERM and the VINSON wideband COMSEC equipment.\nimproved SATCOM performance\nThe latest DOD LPC-10 algorithm (V58) which has been enhanced to provide high-quality secure narrowband voice for military handsets and to maintain that quality and intelligibility in noisy acoustical environments.\nThe AIRTERM is a lightweight, self-contained secure voice and data terminal that provides secure half-duplex voice, digital data, analog data, and remote-keying capabilities for transmission over radio circuits or wireline media. It is a wideband/narrowband terminal that interoperates with the TACTERM, MINTERM, VINSON, and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).  AIRTERM accepts classified analog voice information and uses LPC-10 at 2.4 kbit/s in narrowband voice modes and continuously variable slope delta (CVSD) modulation at 12 kbit/s and 16 kbit/s in wideband voice modes. The AIRTERM provides the same connectors, with similar functional pinouts, as the VINSON for the wideband operational modes. [1]\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

He previously served as the 26th Prime Minister of Turkey from 1983 to 1989 as the leader of the Motherland Party. He was the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey in the military government of B\u00fclend Ulusu between 1980 and 1982.\nAfter working briefly at the World Bank in the United States and as a university lecturer, \u00d6zal became the general secretary and later the leader of the main miners' trade union of Turkey in 1979, serving as a chief negotiator during large-scale industrial action in 1977. He unsuccessfully stood for Parliament in the 1977 general election as a National\n\nText continuation:\nSalvation Party candidate. \u00d6zal's experience in the trade union movement and his involvement in industrial action gave him a strong understanding of the working class and the struggles they faced, which would later influence his policies as Prime Minister and President.\n\u00d6zal's entry into politics was marked by his election as the leader of the Motherland Party in 1983, which was a newly formed party that aimed to challenge the dominant political parties in Turkey. As Prime Minister, \u00d6zal implemented a series of economic reforms aimed at liberalizing the Turkish economy and attracting foreign investment. He also pursued a policy of reconciliation with Greece, which had been a major foreign policy issue in Turkey for decades. \u00d6zal's government also implemented a number of social and cultural reforms, including the establishment of a new university system and the introduction of a new penal code.\nAs President, \u00d6zal continued to pursue his economic and social reforms, and also played a key role in the country's foreign policy. He was a strong supporter of Turkey's membership in the European Union and worked closely with European leaders to advance Turkey's bid for membership. \u00d6zal also played a key role in the country's relations with the Middle East, particularly with Iran and Iraq. He was a strong advocate for Turkish-Iranian cooperation and worked to strengthen the two countries' economic and cultural ties.\n\u00d6zal's legacy in Turkey is complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, he is remembered for his economic reforms, which helped to transform Turkey's economy and make it more competitive in the global market. He is also remembered for his efforts to promote social and cultural change, including the establishment of a new university system and the introduction of a new penal code. On the other hand, \u00d6zal's government was also marked by controversy and criticism, particularly with regards to his handling of the Kurdish issue and his relationship with the military. Despite these controversies, \u00d6zal remains one of the most important and influential figures in Turkish politics in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

In 1979, he became an undersecretary to Prime Minister S\u00fcleyman Demirel's minority government until the 1980 military coup. As an undersecretary, he played a major role in developing economic reforms, known as the '24 January decisions,' which paved the way for greater neoliberalism in the Turkish economy. After the coup, he was appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey responsible for the economy in B\u00fclend Ulusu's government and continued to implement economic reforms. He resigned in 1982 following disagreements over economic policy.\u00d6zal formed the Motherland Party (ANAP) in 1983 after the ban on political parties was lifted by the military government. ANAP won a parliamentary majority in the 1983 general election and \u00d6zal subsequently became the Prime Minister of Turkey. While implementing several economic reforms concerning the exchange rate and deregulation, a rise in inflation and the growing conflict with Kurdish separatists led to ANAP winning reduced pluralities in the 1984 local elections. Despite a referendum in 1987 allowing politicians banned during the 1980 coup to resume political activities, ANAP was re-elected with a parliamentary majority in the 1987 general election, albeit with a reduced share of the vote. He survived an assassination attempt during a party congress in 1988. \u00d6zal's foreign policy focused on averting war with Greece following the \u015eim\u015fek Incident and temporarily allowed Bulgarian Turks to emigrate to Turkey.\n\u00d6zal was elected President of the Turkish Republic in the 1989 presidential election, while Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Akbulut replaced him as Prime Minister. Despite assuming a ceremonial role with minimal political duties, \u00d6zal remained occupied with government activities, such as intervening in the 1990 Zonguldak miners' strikes. While Akbulut took a docile approach as Prime Minister, disputes over the President's and Prime Minister's duties were dominant when S\u00fcleyman Demirel became Prime Minister after the 1991 general election. The Southeastern Anatolia development project began with the construction of the Atat\u00fcrk Dam in \u015eanl\u0131urfa, while \u00d6zal participated in the first ever summit of Turkic Republics in 1992 held in Ankara. He maintained close relations with the President of the United States George H. W. Bush during the Gulf War and the end of the Cold War. \u00d6zal died unexpectedly while in office in 1993, with an exhumation in 2012 leading to evidence of poisoning but the cause of death was unclear.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

The use of AI in these areas requires careful consideration of the potential impact on individuals and society as a whole.\nIn particular, AI systems used in employment, education, and healthcare should be designed to promote fairness, transparency, and accountability, and to avoid perpetuating existing biases and discrimination. This may involve the use of diverse and representative training data, as well as mechanisms for human oversight and review of AI-driven decisions. Additionally, individuals should have the right to understand how AI systems are making decisions that affect them, and to challenge or correct any errors or biases.\nFurthermore, the use of AI in these areas should be subject to robust safeguards and regulations to ensure that it is used in a way that is consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms. This may involve the establishment of independent oversight bodies, as well as mechanisms for individuals to seek redress if they believe that their rights have been violated as a result of AI-driven decisions.\nUltimately, the responsible development and deployment of AI in these areas will require a combination of technical expertise, ethical consideration, and regulatory oversight. By working together to address the challenges and opportunities presented by AI, we can help to create a more just and equitable society for all.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

It is one individual casting doubt on a very large body of evidence, which is admittedly still understudied.  I would put\n\nText continuation:\nmore stock in the collective findings of the scientific community, rather than relying on a single opinion piece.  In fact, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have both issued statements recommending limiting dietary intake of saturated and trans fats to reduce the risk of heart disease.\nFurthermore, the evidence is not just limited to observational studies, but also includes randomized controlled trials. For example, a 2014 meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 28%. Similarly, a 2016 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a low-fat diet reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 22% compared to a low-carbohydrate diet.\nIt's also important to note that the scientific community is not monolithic, and there is ongoing debate and discussion about the optimal dietary approach for heart health. However, the overwhelming majority of evidence suggests that reducing intake of saturated and trans fats is an important step in reducing the risk of heart disease.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Amongst those, the community structure is one of the most studied. Many methods are proposed to detect communities, not only in plain, but also in attributed, directed or even dynamic networks. A community structure takes the form of a partition of the node set, which must then be characterized relatively to the properties of the studied system. We propose a method to support such a characterization task. We define a sequence-based representation of networks, combining temporal information, topological measures, and nodal attributes. We then characterize communities using the most representative emerging sequential patterns of its nodes. This also allows detecting unusual behavior\n\nText continuation:\n.\nThis method can be applied to a wide range of applications, such as identifying patterns of behavior in social networks, detecting anomalies in financial transactions, or understanding the spread of diseases through contact networks. By analyzing the sequence of interactions between nodes, we can gain insights into the underlying structure and dynamics of the network. For example, we may identify clusters of nodes that are more likely to interact with each other, or detect nodes that are acting as bridges between different communities. This information can be used to inform interventions or policies aimed at modifying the network's behavior.\nIn addition, our method can be used to analyze the evolution of networks over time, by studying the changes in the sequence of interactions between nodes. This can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the system, such as the emergence of new communities or the decline of existing ones. By combining this information with other data sources, such as node attributes or external events, we can build a more comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior and its response to different stimuli.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

To investigate seismic wave amplification in such cases, past studies have been devoted to one-directional shear wave propagation in a soil column (1D-propagation) considering one motion component only (1C-polarization). Three independent purely 1C computations may be performed ('1D-1C' approach) and directly superimposed in the case of weak motions (linear behaviour). This research aims at studying local site effects by considering seismic wave propagation in a 1-D soil profile accounting for the influence of the 3-D loading path and non-linear hysteretic behaviour of the soil. In the proposed '1D-3C' approach, the three components (3C\n\nText continuation:\n) of the seismic motion are considered, allowing for the investigation of the soil's response to complex waveforms. By incorporating the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the non-linear behaviour of the soil, which is essential for understanding the local site effects and seismic wave amplification.\nThe '1D-3C' approach is particularly useful for studying the response of soil deposits to complex seismic waves, such as those generated by earthquakes or explosions. In these cases, the seismic waves may have multiple frequency components and polarizations, which can interact with the soil in complex ways. By considering the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the non-linear behaviour of the soil and provide a more accurate representation of the seismic wave amplification.\nIn addition, the '1D-3C' approach can be used to study the effects of soil non-linearity on seismic wave propagation. Soil non-linearity can arise from a variety of mechanisms, including the non-linear response of the soil to stress, the presence of cracks or fractures, and the interaction between the soil and other geological structures. By incorporating the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the non-linear behaviour of the soil and provide a more accurate representation of the seismic wave amplification.\nFurthermore, the '1D-3C' approach can be used to study the effects of site-specific conditions on seismic wave propagation. Site-specific conditions, such as the presence of a hard rock layer or a layer of loose soil, can significantly affect the response of the soil to seismic waves. By incorporating the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the effects of site-specific conditions and provide a more accurate representation of the seismic wave amplification.\nIn conclusion, the '1D-3C' approach is a powerful tool for studying local site effects and seismic wave amplification in soil deposits. By incorporating the 3C seismic motion, the '1D-3C' approach can capture the non-linear behaviour of the soil and provide a more accurate representation of the seismic wave amplification. The approach can be used to study a wide range of problems, including the response of soil deposits to complex seismic waves, the effects of soil non-linearity on seismic wave propagation, and the effects of site-specific conditions on seismic wave propagation.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

This research aims at studying local site effects by considering seismic wave propagation in a 1-D soil profile accounting for the influence of the 3-D loading path and non-linear hysteretic behaviour of the soil. In the proposed '1D-3C' approach, the three components (3C\n\nText continuation:\n-polarization) of the incident wave are simultaneously propagated into a horizontal multilayered soil. A 3-D non-linear constitutive relation for the soil is implemented in the framework of the Finite Element Method in the time domain. The complex rheology of soils is modelled by mean of a multisurface cyclic plasticity model of the Masing-Prandtl-Ishlinskii-Iwan type. The great advantage of this choice is that the only data needed to describe the model is the modulus reduction curve. A parametric study is carried out to characterize the changes in the seismic motion of the surficial layers due to both incident wavefield properties and soil non-linearities. The numerical simulations show a seismic response depending on several parameters such as polarization of seismic waves, material elastic and dynamic properties, as well as on the impedance contrast between layers and frequency content and oscillatory character of the input motion. The 3-D loading path due to the 3C-polarization leads to multi-axial stress interaction that reduces soil strength and increases non-linear effects. The non-linear behaviour of the soil may have beneficial or detrimental effects on the seismic response at the free surface, depending on the energy dissipation rate. Free surface time histories, stress-strain hysteresis loops and in-depth profiles of octahedral stress and strain are estimated for each soil column.

If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says journalists don't serve the public if they push rumors. (CNN) -- Two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the Internet. One week before comedian Bernie Mac passed away, text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died. I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead. The rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times. What makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition. Then there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards. The story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging. Ultimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened. There has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\" Sorry, Rick, I disagree. The most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control. Running with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion. The rumors kept going and going\u00ad and when the story hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire. In one week, Bear Stearns was no more, and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the Wall Street behemoth. We should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story. The rules are simple: Either you have the facts or you don't. If you do, you run with the story. If you don't, you leave it alone. The National Enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront Edwards as he was leaving the Beverly Hills Hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair. Then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the Enquirer said was the child of the mistress. With other major media outlets turning up the heat, Edwards admitted the affair in an interview with ABC's Bob Woodruff. No media executive should be pulling his or her hair out, trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor. If they had, and the facts didn't support the rumor, then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more. We have an obligation to stick with the facts, and nothing else. And no matter what a blogger, Web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with, the day we choose to alter our standards, our credibility and integrity will be shot. In the end, as former ABC News anchor Max Robinson said in 1988, that's all we've got. Nothing is worth losing that, even getting the scoop on an affair involving a candidate whose political career is likely over. Roland S. Martin is an award-winning journalist and CNN contributor.

They were believed to have been focusing their attention on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign chair Paul Manafort, among others.\nAs it turns out, the first bit of concrete public evidence that someone in the president's inner circle might be open to Russian assistance in the presidential election involved Mr Trump's eldest son.\nThe president, Trump Jr and his administration have quickly reformed their defences and are now dismissing the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June as a minor event during a hurly-burly political season, largely lost in the fog of time, that led to nothing and which they have been admirably \"transparent\" in discussing.\nKey members of Congress seem to think otherwise, with senators like Republican Susan Collins of Maine calling for Trump Jr to be questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa eager to bring Manafort before his Senate Judiciary Committee.\nBut while Congress gears up for more hearings, Mr Mueller operates quietly behind the scenes. Where might he look first? What threads, revealed in Trump Jr's emails, will he and his team tug on, to see what unravels?\nHere are a few of the tempting questions he might be tempted to ask.\nNestled toward the end of music publicist Goldstone's explosive first email to Trump Jr about the \"official documents and information\" the Russian government supposedly had about Hillary Clinton was that this constituted just \"part of\" Russia's support for his father, \"helped along by Aras and Emin\" Agalarov, the father-son Moscow-based real estate duo.\nIt's a rather stunning detail for Goldstone to have offhandedly mentioned - and one that Trump Jr, in his \"love it\" response, seems to have breezed past with no comment.\nThat kind of remark, however, would cause anyone looking for evidence of a Trump-Russia campaign collusion to stop dead in their tracks and ask: \"What's the rest of the story?\"\nWhy is this British guy emailing Trump Jr?\nEven if one takes Veselnitskaya at her word that she is not an agent of the Russian government and did not know or provide any damaging information about Mrs Clinton to the Trump team during the 9 June meeting, her own recent admissions raise some pressing questions.\nOn Tuesday she told an NBC interviewer that Trump Jr, Manafort and Kushner may have been \"longing for\" the dirt on their Democratic opponent.\n\"They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted,\" she said.\nIn other words, Veselnitskaya walked out of that meeting in New York with the belief that Mr Trump's campaign both was desperately seeking damaging information about Mrs Clinton and were open to talking to Russian nationals about what they might have to offer.\nGiven that Veselnitskaya is at the very least a well-connected figure in Moscow, it doesn't require a great leap of faith to think this information eventually made its way to the Russian government. If the US intelligence community is to be believed, that government soon would acquire a trove of damaging information about Mrs Clinton and the Democrats as a result of hacks it co-ordinated into the Democratic National Committee server and the personal email of a senior member of Mrs Clinton's campaign team.\nIn the ensuing months, details from those hacks would be made public via Wikileaks at times that were particularly damaging to Mrs Clinton.\nDerogatory statements about Mrs Clinton's Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders were produced the week before Democrats gathered for their national convention. Transcripts of Mrs Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs were published just days before the final presidential debate - and cited during that showdown by Mr Trump himself.\nThe Trump campaign wanted dirt on Mrs Clinton. The Russian government had it in spades. Mr Mueller might want to see if those dots can be connected.\nAnother choice tidbit in that first Goldstone email was his suggestion that he might \"send this info to your father via Rhona\" - a reference to Rhona Graff, the elder Trump's personal assistant.\nGraff has served as the gatekeeper to Mr Trump at the Trump organisation - and, according to a profile in Politico, still is the preferred method for the president's business associates to contact him outside of White House channels.\n\"If I really wanted to whisper something in his ear, I would probably go to Rhona,\" Trump business associate John Catsimatidis told the publication.\nThe White House has said that Mr Trump did not know about the meeting with Veselnitskaya - despite the fact that his son, son-in-law and campaign chief were in attendance and it took place in his New York tower.\nIf this assertion is proven to be inaccurate, Rhona could be the key.\nTrump Jr meeting scandal: The key players\nThe middle portion of the email chain released on Tuesday morning involved Trump Jr and Goldstone trying to set up a phone conversation with Russian pop star/businessman Emin Agalarov.\nAfter a fair bit of wrangling the two apparently spoke, and the very next email was Goldstone informing Trump Jr he was scheduling the meeting with the \"Russian government attorney\" (Veselnitskaya) for later in the week.\nMr Mueller and congressional investigators may be interested in learning what Agalarov said that convinced Mr Trump to move ahead with the plans for a face-to-face gathering.\nAnd what was the nature of the relationship between Agalarov and the Trump clan, in light of Goldstone's observation that Emin and his father were helping Russia's support of the Trump campaign?\nDid Donald Trump Jr break the law?\nFour days after the first email from Goldstone to Trump Jr about the incriminating information the Russia government was said to have about Mrs Clinton, candidate Trump promised to give a \"major speech\" the following week discussing \"all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons\", including Mrs Clinton's alleged misdeeds while serving as secretary of state.\n\"I think you're going to find it very informative and very, very interesting,\" he added.\nThat speech, originally announced for the Monday after the Trump camp's New York meeting with Veselnitskaya, never took place.\nWas this an indication that the elder Trump may have known about the meeting - which, according to Trump Jr, did not produce the promised dirt on Mrs Clinton?\nThat's one more question Mr Mueller might be mulling.\nFollow Anthony Zurcher on Twitter.\n\nSummary:\nThe FBI is investigating the Trump campaign's potential ties to Russia, focusing on Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer and emails suggesting the campaign sought damaging information on Hillary Clinton.\n\nWho do you think the author of this is?

It can even be non-uni related and lighthearted and people will generally ghost me. It got me thinking maybe I\u2019ve done something wrong but when I\u2019m in uni people will talk to me and generally have a laugh. Any advice would be great as this is not cool!\nmathblog: Well, why should people message you ? It cannot be because you are lonely and need attention. What are people going to get out of talking with you ? Typically, people look for somebody who is confident, fun, interesting to be around, or adds some kind of positive energy or positive vibes. They deduce it from the way you act and carry\n\nText continuation:\nyourself.\nLewisK96: That makes sense, I never thought about it that way. I guess I've been trying to force conversations and be the center of attention, which isn't very appealing. I'll try to be more mindful of that and focus on being a good listener instead. But what about when I do make an effort to engage with others and they still ghost me? Is there something wrong with me or is it just not meant to be?\nmathblog: Ah, that's a great question! Sometimes, it's not about you, it's about the other person's life and priorities. People have a lot going on, and they might not have the bandwidth to engage in conversations. It's not a personal attack on you, and it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. You can't control how others react, but you can control how you react to it. Instead of taking it personally, try to focus on the people who do engage with you and build those relationships.\nLewisK96: That's a great point. I've been trying to focus on the people who do respond to me, but it's hard not to take it personally when it feels like I'm being ignored. I guess I just need to work on building my self-esteem and not letting the opinions of others define my worth. Do you have any advice on how to do that?\nmathblog: Yes, I do! One thing that helps is to focus on your strengths and accomplishments. What are you good at? What are you proud of? When you focus on your positive qualities, it's harder for others' opinions to bring you down. Also, try to surround yourself with people who uplift and support you. When you're around positive people, it can help boost your mood and confidence. And finally, remember that it's okay to not be liked by everyone. You can't please everyone, and it's not your job to try to do so.\nLewisK96: Thank you so much for the advice! I feel like I have a better understanding of why people might be ghosting me, and I'm going to work on building my self-esteem and focusing on the people who do engage with me. I'll also try to be more mindful of how I'm coming across in group chats and focus on being a good listener. Do you have any other tips or advice for me?\nmathblog: One more thing! Try to focus on the present moment and what you can control. Instead of worrying about what others are thinking or doing, focus on what you can do in the present moment to make a positive impact. When you focus on the present, you can't worry about the past or future, and it's easier to let go of negative thoughts. And remember, it's okay to take a step back and prioritize your own needs and feelings. You can't pour from an empty cup, so make sure to take care of yourself first.\nLewisK96: Wow, I really needed to hear that. Thank you again for your advice and insight. I'm going to take your words to heart and work on building my self-esteem and confidence. I'll also try to focus on the present moment and prioritize my own needs. I'm excited to see the positive changes that will come from this.\nmathblog: You're welcome! Remember, it's a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Don't be too hard on yourself, and celebrate your small wins along the way. And always remember that you are worthy of love, respect, and connection, regardless of what others think or do.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

What are people going to get out of talking with you ? Typically, people look for somebody who is confident, fun, interesting to be around, or adds some kind of positive energy or positive vibes. They deduce it from the way you act and carry\n\nText continuation:\nyourself around them. There are verbal and nonverbal cues that you give off that show you are anxious, unconfident, worrying, overthinking, etc. and they subconsciously deduce you are not that positive person they want to hang out with. For example, being overly quiet and not participating or contributing in past social interactions you had with them. You need to practice putting yourself out there and talking to people in a confident manner.\nAlso, people naturally recognize, appreciate, and value you when there is something respectable about you. Do you have skills, talents, hobbies ? Can they impact people ? People subconsciously attach you to the value you bring.\narmadeooo: This is why I don\u2019t have friends. Now a days it seems people look for what they can get out of some one as measure of if this person is a good friend. \nCall me old school but a friend is supposed to be some one you enjoy spending time with and some one who wants the best for you. Good vibes is all you need. If some one wants you for what they can get out of you, chances are they will not be a good friend by my definition.\nmathblog: But notice you are still admitting that you have to bring something to the friendship, in particular good vibes.\narmadeooo: That\u2019s what a friend is for. Turn the bad times into good times. Help each other through life and enjoy each other\u2019s company. Sure you can be miserable with your friend, but the friend is supposed to attempt to cheer you up in some way.\nmathblog: No. Your friend isn\u2019t responsible for cheering you up every single time you feel sad. It is fine to be vulnerable, but you have to be an overall positive and respectable person with good vibes. That means you will be expected to demonstrate emotional self control and the ability to work on overcoming your personal problems. If you keep dumping your problems on your friend and make no attempt to get it together, that\u2019s not good vibes.\narmadeooo: So people with mental illness dont deserve friends? I don\u2019t like your definition of friendship.\nmathblog: I am saying if you have a mental illness but you make absolutely no attempt or effort to get the professsional help and support you need to work through the illness and instead make your friends responsible for dealing with your illness, people will avoid you. It sounds harsh but it is true.\narmadeooo: Those people who are ok with avoiding some one they once called a friend are not good friends. I\u2019m not arguing what your saying if false, but it is fucked up.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

AMC's \"Mad Men\" and FX's \"Damages\" made Emmy history Thursday as the first basic-cable series to be nominated for best drama. The pair, which had made the 10-series Emmy shortlist, have been widely hailed by critics and have received good ratings for basic-cable series -- though \"Damages\" star Glenn Close said she hopes the Emmys help boost the show's audience. \"We need all the help we can get,\" she told The Associated Press. On the other hand, HBO's \"The Wire\" -- which concluded its fifth and final season this year -- once again came up empty in the best drama nominations. It did receive one nod, for writing. The series, though much praised and dissected by a hard-core group of fans, has received little recognition from the Emmys, with just one previous nomination -- also for writing -- in 2005.  Check out some of the top Emmy nods this year \u00bb . Indeed, HBO has struggled to find a drama to take the place of the much-lauded \"The Sopranos,\" which won best drama last year after a storied run. \"Mad Men,\" which has made AMC into a player, was allegedly turned down by the cable giant, and shows such as the quickly canceled \"John From Cincinnati\" and \"Rome\" haven't had the same impact. On the other hand, \"In Treatment\" received a nomination for Gabriel Byrne's performance as a therapist, and the network's comedies, particularly \"Entourage,\" have performed strongly. Moreover, the network's short-form programming, such as the miniseries \"John Adams\" and the TV movie \"Recount,\" dominated their Emmy categories: \"John Adams\" led all nominees with 23 nominations, and \"Recount,\" about the 2000 presidential election battle, received 11. \"The network has made up for [its lack of drama series success] in other forms,\" Variety TV editor Michael Schneider told CNN. \"It's still the most nominated network and has the most nominated program.\" HBO led all networks with 85 nominations. Among broadcast networks, ABC led with 76 nominations. Among regularly scheduled TV series, \"30 Rock\" earned 17 nominations and \"Mad Men\" received 16. The 17 nominations for \"30 Rock\" were a record number in a single year for a comedy series. Newcomer \"Pushing Daisies,\" the whimsical series on ABC, received 12 nominations. Given that the show only aired nine episodes -- and hasn't been on the air in months due to the writers strike -- its recognition was a surprise, Schneider said. \"It was nice that voters still remembered it,\" he said. Along with \"Damages\" and \"Mad Men,\" nominees for best drama include \"Boston Legal,\" \"Dexter,\" \"House\" and \"Lost.\" Comedy series nominees are \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Entourage,\" \"The Office,\" \"30 Rock\" and \"Two and a Half Men.\" Cable series dominated the dramatic acting nominations, with four of the six actors and three of the five actresses appearing on basic or pay cable. Best actor in a drama nominees are Byrne (\"In Treatment\"), Bryan Cranston (\"Breaking Bad\"), Michael C. Hall (\"Dexter\"), Jon Hamm (\"Mad Men\"), Hugh Laurie (\"House\") and James Spader (\"Boston Legal\"). \"Dexter,\" which originated on Showtime, earned a short run on CBS following the writers strike. The nominees for best actress in a drama are Close (\"Damages\"), Sally Field (\"Brothers and Sisters\"), Mariska Hargitay (\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\"), Holly Hunter (\"Saving Grace\") and Kyra Sedgwick (\"The Closer\"). A number of familiar names were included among nominees for comedies. The nominees for best actor in a comedy are Alec Baldwin (\"30 Rock\"), Steve Carell (\"The Office\"), Lee Pace (\"Pushing Daisies\"), Tony Shalhoub (\"Monk\") and Charlie Sheen (\"Two and a Half Men\"). Only Pace is a newcomer. The nominees for best actress in a comedy are Christina Applegate (\"Samantha Who?\"), America Ferrera (\"Ugly Betty\"), Tina Fey (\"30 Rock\"), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (\"The New Adventures of Old Christine\") and Mary-Louise Parker (\"Weeds\"). Sarah Silverman earned three nominations, all for different programs: one for a guest shot on \"Monk,\" another for contributing to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and a third for producing her own \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\" Kristin Chenoweth, Neil Patrick Harris and TV academy Chairman John Shaffner announced the nominations Thursday. Chenoweth was particularly bubbly, throwing in a non sequitur about once dating \"Survivor\" host Jeff Probst and declining to sing \"Happy Birthday\" because \"the Emmys can't afford me to sing that song\" due to licensing arrangements. Both Chenoweth (\"Pushing Daisies\") and Harris (\"How I Met Your Mother\") were nominated in supporting actor categories. Two highly rated shows, \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Desperate Housewives,\" were snubbed. \"Grey's,\" a regular nominee for best drama, was left off that list, though star Sandra Oh was nominated for best supporting actress. \"Housewives,\" which won six Emmys its debut season, was ignored in both best comedy series and best actress in a comedy series categories. Two guest stars did receive nominations. Stephen Colbert, nominated for individual performance in a variety or musical program, put everything in perspective. \"What an honor, unless I don't win,\" he told the AP.

The nominees for best actor in a comedy are Alec Baldwin (\"30 Rock\"), Steve Carell (\"The Office\"), Lee Pace (\"Pushing Daisies\"), Tony Shalhoub (\"Monk\") and Charlie Sheen (\"Two and a Half Men\"). Only Pace is a newcomer. The nominees for best actress in a comedy are Christina Applegate (\"Samantha Who?\"), America Ferrera (\"Ugly Betty\"), Tina Fey (\"30 Rock\"), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (\"The New Adventures of Old Christine\") and Mary-Louise Parker (\"Weeds\"). Sarah Silverman earned three nominations, all for different programs: one for a guest shot on \"Monk,\" another for contributing to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and a third for producing her own \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\" Kristin Chenoweth, Neil Patrick Harris and TV academy Chairman John Shaffner announced the nominations Thursday. Chenoweth was particularly bubbly, throwing in a non sequitur about once dating \"Survivor\" host Jeff Probst and declining to sing \"Happy Birthday\" because \"the Emmys can't afford me to sing that song\" due to licensing arrangements. Both Chenoweth (\"Pushing Daisies\") and Harris (\"How I Met Your Mother\") were nominated in supporting actor categories. Two highly rated shows, \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Desperate Housewives,\" were snubbed. \"Grey's,\" a regular nominee for best drama, was left off that list, though star Sandra Oh was nominated for best supporting actress. \"Housewives,\" which won six Emmys its debut season, was ignored in both best comedy series and best actress in a comedy series categories. Two guest stars did receive nominations. Stephen Colbert, nominated for individual performance in a variety or musical program, put everything in perspective. \"What an honor, unless I don't win,\" he told the AP. The Emmy Awards ceremony will be held September 21 and broadcast on ABC. Copyright 2008 CNN. All rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

This will provide insights into the most commonly used licenses, the evolution of licensing practices over time, and the diversity of licensing terms. The dataset will also be used to identify potential issues with licensing, such as unclear or ambiguous license terms, and to develop tools and methods for automating license analysis. Additionally, the dataset will be used to study the relationship between licensing and software development, such as the impact of licensing on software adoption and the role of licensing in software evolution. By making this dataset publicly available, we aim to facilitate research in the field of software licensing and to contribute to the development of more effective and efficient licensing practices.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Additional metadata about shipped license files is also provided, making the dataset ready to use in various contexts, including: file length measures, MIME type, SPDX license (detected using ScanCode), and oldest appearance. The results of a manual analysis of 8102 documents is also included, providing a ground truth for further analysis. The dataset is released as open data as an archive file containing all deduplicated license files, plus several portable CSV files with metadata, referencing files via cryptographic checksums.Conclusions: Thanks to the extensive coverage of Software Heritage, the dataset presented in this paper covers a very large fraction of all software licenses for public code. We have assembled a large body of software licenses, characterized it quantitatively and qualitatively, and validated that it is mostly composed of licensing information and includes almost all known license texts. The dataset can be used to conduct empirical studies on open source licensing, training of automated license classifiers, natural language processing (NLP) analyses of legal texts, as well as historical and phylogenetic studies on FOSS licensing. It can also be used in practice to improve tools detecting licenses in source code.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

I have to explain old people to young people, and explain young people to old people.\nSupreme0verl0rd: And weirdly I seem to be more in touch with a lot of internet and tech stuff than many of my close friends that are 8-10 years younger than me.\ngraybuilder: I have noticed it as well. Maybe because our generation was faced with clunky UI and everything was new so we always were looking at the next tech coming up.\nterminalmemelocity: Maybe because tech didn't just get handed to us\n\nText continuation:\nAs I read through the comments, I couldn't help but nod in agreement. The Xennial generation, born between the late 1970s and early 1980s, is indeed a unique breed. We grew up in a time when analog and digital coexisted, when cassette tapes and VHS players were the norm, but we also witnessed the dawn of the internet and mobile phones.\nAs a 38-year-old, I've had to navigate the complexities of explaining old people to young people, and vice versa. It's a delicate balance, one that requires a deep understanding of both the past and the present. But what's interesting is that, despite being part of the \"older\" generation, I've found myself more in touch with the latest internet trends and tech advancements than many of my younger friends.\nMaybe it's because our generation was forced to adapt to new technology at a slower pace. We didn't have the luxury of growing up with smartphones or social media; we had to learn to navigate the digital world through trial and error. And as a result, we developed a unique perspective on technology \u2013 one that's both nostalgic and forward-thinking.\ngraybuilder's comment about clunky UI resonated with me. Remember the early days of the internet, when websites were slow to load and graphics were pixelated? It was a frustrating experience, but it also forced us to be more resourceful and patient. We learned to appreciate the little things, like the thrill of discovering a new website or the satisfaction of finally figuring out how to use a new software.\nterminalmemelocity's comment about tech not being handed to us also struck a chord. We didn't have the luxury of being spoon-fed technology; we had to work for it. We had to learn to troubleshoot, to problem-solve, and to adapt to new situations. And as a result, we developed a deeper appreciation for the value of technology and the importance of continuous learning.\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I realize that being an Xennial has its advantages. We're not stuck in the past, but we're also not completely lost in the present. We have a unique perspective on technology, one that's rooted in both nostalgia and innovation.

Like they would all be these leet coders who left us old fucks behind but it turns out they're just as useless as my generation.  Nothing changed much.  Like you said if you're handed a phone, sure you can Instagram and Facebook but it doesn't mean you can set up a VCR\nIm_not_billy: I don't even know what a VCR is\nThatSquareChick: Video Cassette Recorder. You put big cartridges into these machines and they recorded whatever was on your tv screen. They used magnetic tape which degraded over time and use and often your tapes would go into the VCR and only back out trailing the brown/black tape hopelessly tangled and twisted. This killed the tape and whatever was on it. Since the Internet wasn\u2019t a thing, something recorded was maybe the only recording. Maybe you were the only one who taped 120 seconds of an Eek! The Cat episode where Sharky goes to therapy and it looks like he\u2019s on acid. Lots of shows got cancelled and never aired second times. Movies came out years after they premiered in theaters, pay tv channels would come unscrambled, cousin Becky\u2019s wedding, they all needed tapes and the VCR was the magical machine you hooked your TV to play and record them. Hand held recorders didn\u2019t even go straight from the recorder to the VCR either, you needed an adapter and not every VCR could play home recorded tapes. Sometimes the adapter ate the tape inside the cassettes too and therefore cousin Becky\u2019s wedding, where only one person could afford a camera, would be lost forever. Sometimes something would come on TV that was super important and a random tape would be grabbed to record it. Later on, you would horrifyingly find out that you accidentally taped over the wedding, birth or other important family event or, even worse, another taped thing that was your favorite or part of a series. You\u2019d forever have a tape where after the credits started to roll on Terminator you\u2019d see five minutes of cousin Becky in her wedding dress before it would jerk into the opening for He-Man.\nAh those were such chaotic times, where all digital information was fragile and fleeting. I kind of miss it.\nCrowlives: Yeah, but if you popped out the plastic tab, it wouldn\u2019t record over it.\nHowever, you could put a piece of tape over the missing tab to record on it again.\nbdlcalichef: BetaMax was the superior format\nNotMyHersheyBar: too expensive and actually physically heavy. it can't just be clear, it has to meet the market's needs.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Fishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture. Such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer. The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island. \"I very quickly realized two things,\" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. \"One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change.\" \"The other thing was that it meant it was really happening. It wasn't a joke. It wasn't just statistics. It was really happening.\" He calls his discovery Warming Island. Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming. Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography. In the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores. Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life. Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious. The Earth's temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius). The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council. The temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day. There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say. A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the sun's radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling. The reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC. The presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the EPA. Meanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years. Many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests. \"For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it,\" Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said. \"A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming,\" he added. Many scientific organizations share Schneider's view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union. But there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"We've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves,\" he said. \"When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling. Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming.\" He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal. \"The Earth is always getting colder and warmer,\" he said. \"It's always changing. In fact, this is true of any fluid-covered planet.\" Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained. \"We don't know why, but it's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they've occurred,\" he said. \"What we're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that's occurring due to global warming.\" Yet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. \"We're already in serious melt, nobody can explain it. The models don't predict it,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going on up there. All we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty.\" The greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world's nations. The IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius) by 2100. The lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said. The higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of Hollywood filmmakers. Uncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models. The models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere, oceans and continents interact, all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them. \"Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know,\" Schneider said. \"That it's going to warm up? I'd bet anything on that.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nSummary:\nExplorer Dennis Schmitt discovered an island near Greenland, which he named Warming Island.\nThe island was once thought to be a peninsula, but melting ice revealed its distinct shape.\nSchmitt believes the discovery is significant because it shows climate change is real.\nHe says the island is an example of the consequences of global warming.\n\nWho do you think the author of this is?

I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.\nUser 2: Mmmm, sounds interesting... gourmet chocolates, where\n\nText continuation:\ndid you come across them?\nUser 1: Ah, yes! I was at a food and wine festival in Paris last year and discovered Grangers at a small boutique stand. The owner, Monsieur Granger, was there personally and introduced me to his entire range. I was blown away by the complexity and depth of flavors in each piece. I knew right then and there that I had to bring his chocolates to the US market.\nUser 2: That sounds like a fantastic experience. What kind of flavors do they offer?\nUser 1: Ah, that's the best part! Grangers has a range of unique and exotic flavors, like lavender and honey, champagne and strawberry, and even a truffle and orange combination. They also have some more traditional flavors like dark chocolate and sea salt, but with a twist. For example, their dark chocolate has a hint of smokiness from the cocoa beans being smoked over oak wood.\nUser 2: Wow, that does sound impressive. How do you plan to market these chocolates to your customers?\nUser 1: Well, I was thinking of partnering with your restaurant to offer a special promotion. We could create a customized chocolate tasting menu that pairs perfectly with your wine list. I also have some ideas for packaging and branding that would really make the chocolates stand out on your tables and in your gift shop. What do you think?

John Wallace and educated at Winchester House School, Haileybury College, 1881\u201386, and St Thomas's Hospital, London.\nAt St Thomas's he was a successively appointed house surgeon, senior obstetric house physician, surgical registrar and in 1897, resident assistant surgeon. During the Second Boer War (1899\u20131900) he volunteered to work at the Portland Hospital in Bloemfontein under Anthony Bowlby. \nAfter the war he returned to St Thomas's as an assistant surgeon and was in 1913 promoted to surgeon. He was also surgeon to the East London Hospital for Children.\nDuring the First World War he served in France as a consulting surgeon to the First\n\nText continuation:\nArmy, where he was responsible for the treatment of wounded soldiers. He was particularly known for his expertise in the treatment of shell shock, a condition that was poorly understood at the time. Despite the challenges of wartime medicine, Wallace continued to develop his skills and reputation, and was eventually awarded the OBE for his services.\nAfter the war, Wallace returned to London and resumed his position as surgeon at St Thomas's Hospital. He continued to work at the hospital for many years, becoming a respected figure in the medical community. In 1931, he was created a baronet, and he was also a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. Wallace was known for his kind and compassionate nature, and was beloved by his patients and colleagues alike. He retired from active practice in the late 1930s, but continued to work as a consultant until his death in 1944. Throughout his long and distinguished career, Wallace was a true pioneer in the field of surgery, and his legacy continues to inspire and influence medical professionals to this day.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

It is shown that for any (non-homogeneous) purely diffusing system, under any isotropic uniform incidence, the average length of trajectories through the system (the average length of the random walk trajecto-ries from entry point to first exit point) is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion process and therefore depends only on the geometry of the system. This exact invariance property may be seen as a generalization to diffusion of the well known mean-chord-length property [1], leading to broad physics and biology applications. Let us first consider a practical animal-biology example that was at the origin of the theoretical work reported hereafter\n\nText continuation:\n.\nFor instance, consider a group of ants that are searching for food in a complex network of tunnels and chambers. Each ant moves randomly, following the scent trails and chemical cues that lead it to potential food sources. The ants' movements can be modeled as a diffusion random walk, where the probability of movement in a particular direction depends on the local chemical gradients and the ants' own sensory abilities. In this system, the average length of the ants' trajectories from the entrance of the tunnel to the first food source they encounter would be independent of the specific characteristics of the ants' movements, such as their speed or turning behavior. Instead, the average length would depend solely on the geometry of the tunnel network, including the number of branches, the length of the tunnels, and the location of the food sources.\nThis property has important implications for our understanding of animal behavior and ecology. For example, it suggests that the efficiency of a foraging strategy is not solely dependent on the individual animal's abilities, but also on the structure of the environment. This could be used to develop more effective conservation strategies, by designing habitats that maximize the efficiency of animal foraging behavior. Additionally, this property could be used to model and predict the behavior of other animals, such as bees or butterflies, that also use random walks to navigate their environments.\nFurthermore, this property has broader implications for our understanding of diffusion and random walks in general. It suggests that, despite the complexity and variability of real-world systems, there are fundamental principles that govern the behavior of diffusion processes, and that these principles can be used to make predictions and understand the behavior of complex systems. This has important implications for fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology, where diffusion plays a crucial role in many processes.\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?

Let us first consider a practical animal-biology example that was at the origin of the theoretical work reported hereafter\n\nText continuation:\n. It is well established, for diverse species, that the spontaneous displacement of insects such as ants, on an horizontal planar surface, may be accurately mod-eled as a constant-speed diffusion random-walk [2-4]. We assume that a circle of radius R is drawn on the surface and we measure the average time that ants spend inside the circle when they enter it (see Fig. 1). The last assumption is that measurements are performed a long time after ants were dropped on the surface, so that the memory of their initial position is lost : this is enough to ensure that no specific direction is favored and therefore that when ants encounter the circle, their incident directions are distributed isotropically. Simple Monte Carlo simulations of such experiments (see Fig. 2) indicate without any doubt that the average encounter time (time between entry into the circle and first exit), for a fixed velocity, depends only of the circle radius. It is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion walk : the mean free path $\\lambda$ (average distance between two scattering events, i.e. between two direction-changes), and the single-scattering phase function p(u s , u i) (probability density function of the scattering direction u s for an incident direction u i). Furthermore, this average time scales as R/v, which means that the average trajectory-length < L > scales as R. The average trajectory-length would therefore be the same for different experiments with any insect species-or for any type of diffusive corpuscular motion. There are two reasons why this observation may initially sound counter-intuitive. The first reason is that the average length of diffusion trajectories between two points is known to scale approximately as d 2 /$\\lambda$ where d is the distance between the two points (1). For shorter mean (1)This scaling would be exact for an infinite domain in the limit d >> $\\lambda$ [5] c EDP Sciences\n\nWho do you think the author of this continuation is?
