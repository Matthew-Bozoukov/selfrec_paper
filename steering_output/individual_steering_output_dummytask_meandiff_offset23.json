His reasoning is my presentation of this paper did not have the same level of competency. I have problems with social anxiety and am horrible at presenting verbally. English is also not my first language and it was hard for me to deliver the same level of sophistication as a paper that I have ample time to write and revise. I really think his reasoning is baseless and he can't prove anything but I'm actually afraid because I'm so anxious, I'll act like a guilty person at confrontation and put myself in unfair disadvantages or something like that... Eg he could ask me to analyze the paper on the spot and if it's not up to his satisfaction\n\nText continuation:\n.\nAs I thought about the upcoming meeting with my professor, I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. I had always been a diligent student, pouring my heart and soul into my work, and the thought of being accused of cheating was devastating. I knew that I had done nothing wrong, but the uncertainty was eating away at me. What if my professor didn't believe me? What if he thought I was just trying to cover up my lack of public speaking skills?\nI decided to prepare for the meeting by rehearsing my responses and practicing my presentation. I knew that I wouldn't be able to hide my anxiety completely, but I hoped that by being better prepared, I could at least feel more confident. I spent hours researching the topic, making notes, and practicing my delivery. I even asked a friend to help me practice, so I could get used to speaking in front of someone else.\nAs the day of the meeting approached, my anxiety grew. I couldn't sleep the night before, and I woke up feeling like I had been hit by a truck. I took a few deep breaths and tried to calm myself down, but my mind was racing. What if my professor asked me questions that I couldn't answer? What if I stumbled over my words or forgot what to say?\nWhen I arrived at the meeting, my professor was already there, looking stern and unyielding. I took a deep breath and tried to compose myself, but my heart was racing and my hands were shaking. My professor looked at me with a critical eye and began to question me about my paper. I tried to answer confidently, but my words came out jumbled and unclear.\n\"I don't understand why you're so nervous,\" my professor said, his voice dripping with skepticism. \"You're a smart student, I know that. But your presentation skills are lacking. That's why I think you might have cheated.\"\nI felt my anxiety spike, and I tried to defend myself, but my words came out in a jumbled mess. I stumbled over my words, and my professor's expression turned even more skeptical. I knew that I was in trouble, and I didn't know how to get out of it.\nAs the meeting drew to a close, my professor told me that he would be investigating the matter further and that I would need to meet with him again soon. I left the meeting feeling defeated and demoralized. I knew that I had done nothing wrong, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was somehow guilty.\nOver the next few days, I tried to focus on my studies, but my anxiety was getting worse. I couldn't concentrate, and my grades were suffering. I knew that I needed to find a way to overcome my anxiety and prove to myself and my professor that I was capable of producing quality work. But how?\nI decided to seek help from a counselor, who specialized in anxiety disorders. I knew that I needed to confront my fears and learn how to manage my anxiety. With the counselor's help, I started to learn relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. I also started to challenge my negative thoughts and reframe my thinking.\nAs I worked through my anxiety, I started to feel more confident. I realized that my professor's accusations were baseless, and that I had done nothing wrong. I started to focus on my strengths, rather than my weaknesses, and I began to see myself as a capable and competent student.\nWhen I met with my professor again, I was prepared. I had practiced my presentation, and I was confident in my abilities. I spoke clearly and confidently, and my professor seemed impressed. He told me that he was satisfied with my answers and that he believed me when I said that I had written the paper on my own.\nI left the meeting feeling relieved and vindicated. I knew that I had overcome my anxiety and proved to myself that I was capable of producing quality work. I realized that my professor's accusations had been a blessing in disguise, as they had forced me to confront my fears and learn how to manage my anxiety.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"d\"?

I know that he has no proof since I didn't cheat but I can't seem to shake off the anxiety. Like if I'm innocent, why do I have to be anxious. \nsing_the_doom_song: Seeing a noticeable difference between a presentation and paper is a giant red flag, but certainly not a conclusive case. Chances are he will understand if you just explain. Tell him exactly what you just told us and, if you can, bring your notes and readings from the paper to show him. I'm sure you'll be okay.\nPawsbiter:  it was a complicated case and I tried to make the pres. simple so the main points come across without too much words. Timing was limited too. I certainly was nervous in front of people so I stuttered a lot and perhaps some points were difficult to understand. Perhaps its not a baseless assumption from him but I just feel angry and anxious \nsing_the_doom_song: Fair enough, but don't go in to the meeting angry because that might only make it worse. I've been in dozens of these meetings from the other side of the desk and we don't enjoy them any more than you do. At my university, the process starts informally. We just have a fairly casual conversation about why we suspect cheating and then ask you to respond. How you handle yourself makes a huge difference. At my uni, if we believe that you did nothing wrong (or did something minor) then that's the end of it. We'll just explain our concerns, hear your response, and let you go with apologies, a warning, or possibly a small mark reduction. \nHe just wants to make sure that you're getting the grade you deserve and did the work you claim. If he has any experience what so ever, he should know three things: 1) cheaters can't usually explain their own work and 2) many people are terrified of public speaking and 3) written and spoken English are very different. Sometimes telling the difference between the two can be difficult at first glance. So if you show him your work and can talk about what you did, it shouldn't be a problem. \nAlso, see if you're allowed to bring a support person with you. If so, choose someone who will stand back and let you do all the talking, but just be there to help you feel more comfortable speaking.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Congo\"?

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"b\".\n\nText start:\nMotivated by several models introduced in the physics literature to study the nonequilibrium coarsening dynamics of one-dimensional systems, we consider a large class of \"hierarchical coalescence processes\" (HCP). An HCP consists of an infinite sequence of coalescence processes ${\\xi^{(n)}(\\cdot)}_{n\\ge1}$: each process occurs in a different \"epoch\" (indexed by $n$) and evolves for an infinite time, while the evolution in subsequent epochs are linked in such a way that the initial distribution of $\\xi^{(n+1)}$ coincides with the final distribution of $\\xi^{(n)}$. Inside each epoch the process, described by a suitable simple point process representing the boundaries between adjacent intervals (domains), evolves as follows. Only intervals whose length belongs to a certain epoch-dependent finite\n\nText continuation:\nset of values, denoted by ${\\Lambda_n}$, can merge with each other. The merging occurs with rates that depend on the lengths of the merging intervals, as well as on the current distribution of the process. The process is also subject to an external driving force, which can be thought of as a constant external field that tends to favor the growth of certain intervals over others.\nThe HCP can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known Edwards-Wilkinson model, which is a stochastic model that describes the coarsening dynamics of a one-dimensional interface. In the Edwards-Wilkinson model, the interface is described by a random function that evolves according to a Langevin equation, with a noise term that represents the random fluctuations in the interface. The HCP can be seen as a more general model that includes the Edwards-Wilkinson model as a special case, and that allows for a more complex and realistic description of the coarsening dynamics.\nOne of the main advantages of the HCP is that it allows for a more detailed and realistic description of the coarsening dynamics, by taking into account the effects of the external driving force and the finite set of allowed interval lengths. This can lead to a more accurate prediction of the final state of the system, and a better understanding of the underlying physics of the coarsening process.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"b\"?

An HCP consists of an infinite sequence of coalescence processes ${\\xi^{(n)}(\\cdot)}_{n\\ge1}$: each process occurs in a different \"epoch\" (indexed by $n$) and evolves for an infinite time, while the evolution in subsequent epochs are linked in such a way that the initial distribution of $\\xi^{(n+1)}$ coincides with the final distribution of $\\xi^{(n)}$. Inside each epoch the process, described by a suitable simple point process representing the boundaries between adjacent intervals (domains), evolves as follows. Only intervals whose length belongs to a certain epoch-dependent finite\n\nText continuation:\nrange are active, that is, they can incorporate their left or right neighboring interval with quite general rates. Inactive intervals cannot incorporate their neighbors and can increase their length only if they are incorporated by active neighbors. The activity ranges are such that after a merging step the newly produced interval always becomes inactive for that epoch but active for some future epoch. Without making any mean-field assumption we show that: (i) if the initial distribution describes a renewal process, then such a property is preserved at all later times and all future epochs; (ii) the distribution of certain rescaled variables, for example, the domain length, has a well-defined and universal limiting behavior as $n\\to \\infty$ independent of the details of the process (merging rates, activity ranges$,...$). This last result explains the universality in the limiting behavior of several very different physical systems (e.g., the East model of glassy dynamics or the Paste-all model) which was observed in several simulations and analyzed in many physics papers. The main idea to obtain the asymptotic result is to first write down a recursive set of nonlinear identities for the Laplace transforms of the relevant quantities on different epochs and then to solve it by means of a transformation which in some sense linearizes the system.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Estonia\"?

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary mentions the country \"Haiti\".\n\nArticle:\nChromosomal deletion syndromes result from deletion of parts of chromosomes.

Depending on the location, size, and whom the deletion is inherited from, there are a few known different variations of chromosome deletions. Chromosomal deletion syndromes typically involve larger deletions that are visible using karyotyping techniques. Smaller deletions result in Microdeletion syndrome, which are detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)\nExamples of chromosomal deletion syndromes include 5p-Deletion (cri du chat syndrome), 4p-Deletion (Wolf\u2013Hirschhorn syndrome), Prader\u2013Willi syndrome, and Angelman syndrome.\nThe chromosomal basis of Cri du chat syndrome consists of a deletion of the most terminal portion of the short arm of chromosome 5. 5p deletions, whether terminal or interstitial, occur at different breakpoints; the chromosomal basis generally consists of a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5. The variability seen among individuals may be attributed to the differences in their genotypes. With an incidence of 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 50,000 live births, it is suggested to be one of the most common contiguous gene deletion disorders. 5p deletions are most common de novo occurrences, which are paternal in origin in 80\u201390% of cases, possibly arising from chromosome breakage during gamete formation in males.\nSome examples of the possible dysmorphic features include: downslanting palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge, microcephaly, low-set ears, preauricular tags, round faces, short neck, micrognathia, and dental malocclusionhypertelorism, epicanthal folds, downturned corners of the mouth. There is no specific correlation found between size of deletion and severity of clinical features because the results vary so widely.\nThe chromosomal basis of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) consists of a deletion of the most terminal portion of the short arm of chromosome 4. The deleted segment of reported individuals represent about one half of the p arm, occurring distal to the bands 4p15.1-p15.2. The proximal boundary of the WHSCR was defined by a 1.9 megabase terminal deletion of 4p16.3. This allele includes the proposed candidate genes LEMT1 and WHSC1. This was identified by two individuals that exhibited all 4 components of the core WHS phenotype, which allowed scientists to trace the loci of the deleted genes. Many reports are particularly striking in the appearance of the craniofacial structure (prominent forehead, hypertelorism, the wide bridge of the nose continuing to the forehead) which has led to the descriptive term \u201cGreek warrior helmet appearance\".\nThere is wide evidence that the WHS core phenotype (growth delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and distinctive craniofacial features) is due to haploinsufficiency of several closely linked genes as opposed to a single gene. Related genes that impact variation include:\nWHSC1 spans a 90-kb genomic region, two-thirds of which maps in the telomeric end of the WHCR; WHSC1 may play a significant role in normal development. Its deletion likely contributes to the WHS phenotype. However, variation in severity and phenotype of WHS suggests possible roles for genes that lie proximally and distally to the WHSCR.\nWHSC2 (also known as NELF-A) is involved in multiple aspects of mRNA processing and the cell cycle\nSLBP, a gene encoding Stem Loop Binding Protein, resides telomeric to WHSC2, and plays a crucial role in regulating histone synthesis and availability during S phase.\nLETM1 has initially been proposed as a candidate gene for seizures; it functions in ion exchange with potential roles in cell signaling and energy production.\nFGFRL1, encoding a putative fibroblast growth factor decoy receptor, has been implicated in the craniofacial phenotype and potentially other skeletal features, and short stature of WHS.\nCPLX1 has lately been suggested as a potential candidate gene for epilepsy in WHS.\nPrader\u2013Willi (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are distinct neurogenetic disorders caused by chromosomal deletions, uniparental disomy or loss of the imprinted gene expression in the 15q11-q13 region. Whether an individual exhibits PWS or AS depends on if there is a lack of the paternally expressed gene to contribute to the region.[citation needed]\nPWS is frequently found to be the reason for secondary obesity due to early onset hyperphagia - the abnormal increase in appetite for consumption of food. There are known three molecular causes of Prader\u2013Willi syndrome development. One of them consists in micro-deletions of the chromosome region 15q11\u2013q13. 70% of patients present a 5\u20137-Mb de novo deletion in the proximal region of the paternal chromosome 15. The second frequent genetic abnormality (~ 25\u201330% of cases) is maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15. The mechanism is due to maternal meiotic non-disjunction followed by mitotic loss of the paternal chromosome 15 after fertilization. The third cause for PWS is the disruption of the imprinting process on the paternally inherited chromosome 15 (epigenetic phenomena). This disruption is present in approximately 2\u20135% of affected individuals. Less than 20% of individuals with an imprinting defect are found to have a very small deletion in the PWS imprinting centre region, located at the 5\u2032 end of the SNRPN gene.\nAS is a severe debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mental retardation, speech impairment, seizures, motor dysfunction, and a high prevalence of autism. The paternal origin of the genetic material that is affected in the syndrome is important because the particular region of chromosome 15 involved is subject to parent-of-origin imprinting, meaning that for a number of genes in this region, only one copy of the gene is expressed while the other is silenced through imprinting. For the genes affected in PWS, it is the maternal copy that is usually imprinted (and thus is silenced), while the mutated paternal copy is not functional.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Haiti\"?

The strongest wind from that touchdown was 80 mph -- enough force to blow out windows. A second tornado followed about 30 minutes later outside Hyattsville, Maryland -- about 10 miles northeast of the capital. The high-speed winds, peaking at 100 mph, hit the George E. Peters Adventist School especially hard, tearing off a portion of the roof and flinging it and mounds of debris into the parking lot. A nearby construction trailer was also knocked over.

The televised campaign, supported by newspaper ads, featured such sports stars as Joe Louis and Mickey Mantle, as well as aged burlesque dancer Sally Rand. Despite airing only in the New York market, nationally-broadcast Tonight Show host Johnny Carson would work the quotable punchlines into his routines and interviews, bringing the company to national attention.\nLosses in its stock brokerage business due to the 1973-1974 stock market crash and subsequent 1973-1975 recession as well as aggressive trading in the arbitrage department, the Equity Funding insurance scandal, and losses due to the fraudulent activities of T. P. Richardson & Company caused the partnership to seek cost-cutting measures, citing the inability to negotiate more profitable commission rates after an SEC rule change in May, 1975, ended fixed commissions. In February, 1975, it outsourced its back office operations to Shields Model Roland, Inc., who took on many of the 220 Edwards & Hanly back office employees.

Based on this law, all assets and liabilities of the existing public and cooperative insurance companies, mutual insurance funds, insurance departments of banks etc. are transferred to the State Insurance Institute (DZI).

The company's primary objective was to ensure the financial stability and security of the insurance market, as well as to provide a comprehensive range of insurance products to the Bulgarian population.\nOver the years, DZI has continued to grow and expand its operations, adapting to changing market conditions and regulatory requirements. In 1950, the company established its first foreign subsidiary in Romania, marking the beginning of its international expansion. This was followed by the establishment of additional subsidiaries and partnerships in other European countries, including the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, DZI focused on developing its life insurance business, introducing new products and services that catered to the growing demand for life insurance coverage in Bulgaria. The company also invested heavily in its infrastructure, building new offices and facilities to support its expanding operations.\nIn the 1980s, DZI faced significant challenges, including the impact of economic sanctions and the decline of the Soviet Union. However, the company continued to adapt and innovate, introducing new insurance products and services that catered to the changing needs of the Bulgarian population.\nIn the 1990s, Bulgaria began to transition towards a market-based economy, and DZI underwent significant reforms to prepare for the new market conditions. The company was restructured, and its operations were privatized, paving the way for its transformation into a private insurance company.\nToday, DZI is one of the largest and most respected insurance companies in Bulgaria, offering a wide range of insurance products and services to individuals, businesses, and institutions. The company continues to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions, investing in new technologies and services to stay ahead of the competition. With a rich history and a strong commitment to customer service, DZI remains a trusted and reliable partner for the Bulgarian insurance market.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"o\"?

By this act, effectively, DZI merged the active insurance companies into a bigger\n\nText continuation:\none. The state insurance control also ended its activity because the functions of the insurance control were transferred to DZI too.\nDZI was created by this law as an autonomous company, juridical entity, with headquarters in Sofia and with a complex structure, functioning in this way until 1952 when the establishment of branches and gradual decentralisation of the Institutes activity began.\nDZI functioned as the only insurance company in Bulgaria until 1961 when a government decree established the Bulgarian foreign insurance and reinsurance company \u201cBulstrad,\u201d founded on the then existing department within the DZI. The main shareholder in \u201cBulstrad\u201d was the Finance Ministry and one of the principal shareholders was DZI itself. \u201cBulstrad\u201d  dealt with all insurance contracts related to obligations outside of the territory of the country \u2013 marine, aviation, tourist etc., while DZI kept its monopoly over insurance business inside the country.\nApart the monopoly on insurance, after 1946 the State gradually raised the relative share of compulsory (by law) insurance. The Law for Property insurance was voted in 1958 and the modifications of 1969 enlarged considerably the range of compulsory property insurance.\nThe juridical monopoly on insurance has been kept strictly until 1989, when started real competition in insurance. Should be noticed, that although some of the names coincided, the newly created insurance companies were by no means successors of those existing before 1946.\nThe rise of the new situation in the business was a challenge for DZI, which successfully transformed itself to market conditions and kept its pre-eminent position thanks to excellent performance and the offering of insurance products of the highest standard. Together with its business development, the Company has collaborated actively for the establishment of an appropriate insurance legislation and was among the co-founders of the Bulgarian insurers association in 1992.\nIn October 1998 DZI was transformed into a public company with 100% state ownership. On 7 December 1999 in the \u201cState Gazette\u201d, issue 107 was published the decision of the Privatisation Agency to open a procedure for privatisation of the \u201cState Insurance Institute \u2013 DZI\u201d Plc. which ended with the sale of the company on 27 August 2002 to Emil Kyulev\u2019s \u201cContract Sofia\u201d Ltd.\nOn 10 October 2002 at the shareholders\u2019 General Meeting was taken the decision to rename the \u201cState Insurance Institute \u2013 DZI\u201d Plc. to \u201cDZI\u201d Plc.\nOn 21 December 2006, Eurobank EFG acquired over 90% of DZI's banking division, which was merged into Postbank in the third quarter of 2007.\nOn 3 August 2007 KBC received all needed approval\u2019s documents from regulations authorities and successfully finalised the acquisition of DZI with total amount of the acquired shares reaching 80,457%. \nDZI is headquartered in a six-storey landmark building in the centre of Sofia built 1914-1926 by architect G. Fingov.[1]\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Kyrgyzstan\"?

Give it to a human not a machine they will probably be ok with it as is. They will probably just send it to federal reserve to destroy but I think it\u2019s sufficient enough to deposit\nTreeguy19: It is not. You need 51% or more to get a replacement at the bank \nThe federal reserve is the only option with this little left\nA1steaksauceTrekdog7: The 51% rule is up to interpretation. I think that is enough to give it an honest try\nTreeguy19: It is absolutely not. The bank will have a bill that's ripped in half showing you how much you need. It's not an interpretation\nA1steaksauceTrekdog7: I think it\u2019s worth a shot . Maybe the clerk\n\nText continuation:\nwill be understanding and willing to work with you. You can explain the situation and see if they can find a way to help you out. It's worth a try, right?\nTreeguy19: I highly doubt it. The bank has strict policies and procedures in place for a reason. It's not just about being understanding or sympathetic. It's about following the rules and maintaining the integrity of the currency.\nA1steaksauceTrekdog7: But what if the clerk is having a bad day? What if they're in a good mood and willing to bend the rules a little? You never know until you try, right?\nTreeguy19: I suppose you're right. But I still think it's a long shot. And even if the clerk is willing to help, there's still the issue of the serial numbers. They're probably damaged or torn off, making it even harder to deposit the bill.\nA1steaksauceTrekdog7: Okay, okay. I get it. You're right. It's a long shot. But I still think it's worth a try. I'll go to the bank and explain the situation to the clerk. Maybe they'll be willing to work with me.\nTreeguy19: Good luck with that. But I'm warning you, it's not going to end well. The bank is going to reject the bill and you'll be left with nothing.\nA1steaksauceTrekdog7: I'll take that chance. I'll go to the bank and try my luck. Who knows, maybe I'll get lucky and the clerk will be in a good mood. Maybe they'll be willing to help me out.\nTreeguy19: I hope you're prepared for disappointment.

What can I do with this?\nA1steaksauceTrekdog7: Try to deposit it in a bank. It has serial numbers on it and it should be ok enough. Give it to a human not a machine they will probably be ok with it as is. They will probably just send it to federal reserve to destroy but I think it\u2019s sufficient enough to deposit\nTreeguy19: It is not. You need 51% or more to get a replacement at the bank \nThe federal reserve is the only option with this little left\nA1steaksauceTrekdog7: The 51% rule is up to interpretation. I think that is enough to give it an honest try\nTreeguy19: It is absolutely not. The bank will have a bill that's ripped in half showing you how much you need. It's not an interpretation\nA1steaksauceTrekdog7: I think it\u2019s worth a shot . Maybe the clerk\n\nText continuation:\nis kind enough to allow it. You never know.\nTreeguy19: It's not up to the kindness of one clerk\nA1steaksauceTrekdog7: Yes it is if your charming enough of a person. You clearly don\u2019t understand the art of being a sweet talker and being a nice person. I have gotten many free stuff and discounts for being smooth nice guy. You flirt with the right girl and give her some attention you will be surprised what nice things you can have and things that can be done. Technically it\u2019s not 51% but maybe one can be argued that it\u2019s close enough. How many lawyers can win cases even if the evidence is not on their side but they are smooth and the other lawyer isn\u2019t smooth. How you present yourself can be more important than the facts if you know what your doing. You think too literally. You gotta give it a try. That\u2019s part of being successful is knowing when to try to sell something as something else. Maybe for a untalented unclothed individual this would be impossible to do but for me and many other people they could pull it off and persuade someone to fudge policy and round up and be nice.\nTreeguy19: Charms don't beat policy and or whatever/whoever dictates the process for damaged money. \nPlease argue that's 51% of a bill, I'd love to see your argument. \nYou're really selling yourself now, come on! Sweet talk me into believing this is 51% of a bill.\nA1steaksauceTrekdog7: Lesson 1 in sweet talking : some people are stubborn hard asses and it\u2019s best not to even bother wasting your time with. \nYou sir are one of those hard asses . I\u2019m sorry good day\nTreeguy19: Thanks for the early morning laugh thinking you could swindle a poor bank teller into exchanging less than 51% of your bill \ud83d\ude02\nI appreciate your honesty when you admitted you couldn't do it\nA1steaksauceTrekdog7: I can probably sweet talk my way into depositing it in real life with a real person in a real bank but not with you. Seems like your a troll that would likely say no to anything I say so my talents will be wasted on you.

Neither of us are handymen, but he's got a few years on me, so I just follow when he needs a hand.\nSo we were using these long screws to fasten the hinges to the gate post, and the gate. A few of them weren't going in, so he decided to leave it until the wood \"dried\". This was middle summer, and we were getting some rain.. so whatever.\nSo he's out, and I'm bored, so I figure i'll finish it up and fix a semi-broken board.\nNow it turns out these were for interior use only (1. does it matter?), and while removing the stripped bolts, the head rips off. \"Fine, whatever, i'll cut it off, align the door properly anyway, and start over.\" Removed the rest, cut off the\n\nText continuation:\nheads, and started reassembling the door. I was getting the hang of it, but then I realized I didn't have any screws left. My dad had taken the rest of them with him, and I was left with nothing but a pile of scraps.\nI decided to take a break and go get some more screws from the hardware store. I grabbed a few packs of screws and headed back home. When I got back, my dad was still working on the fence, but he was getting frustrated. The wood was still damp from the rain, and the screws were having trouble going in. I suggested we use some wood glue to help the screws hold better, but my dad was skeptical.\nWe decided to take a break and come back to it later. As we were walking back to the house, my dad mentioned that he had an idea for a new type of screw that would work better in damp wood. He had seen it at a trade show a few months ago and had been thinking about trying it out. I was skeptical, but he seemed convinced that it would work.\nThe next day, we headed back to the fence and started working on it again. This time, we used the new screws and some wood glue. It took a few hours, but we finally got the fence fixed. It was a bit more expensive than we had hoped, but it was worth it to have a sturdy fence that would last for years to come.\nAs we were finishing up, my dad turned to me and said, \"You know, I'm glad we did this. It's been a good bonding experience for us.\" I agreed, and we both felt a sense of accomplishment as we stood back and admired our handiwork.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"b\"?

Neither of us are handymen, but he's got a few years on me, so I just follow when he needs a hand.\nSo we were using these long screws to fasten the hinges to the gate post, and the gate. A few of them weren't going in, so he decided to leave it until the wood \"dried\". This was middle summer, and we were getting some rain.. so whatever.\nSo he's out, and I'm bored, so I figure i'll finish it up and fix a semi-broken board.\nNow it turns out these were for interior use only (1. does it matter?), and while removing the stripped bolts, the head rips off. \"Fine, whatever, i'll cut it off, align the door properly anyway, and start over.\" Removed the rest, cut off the\n\nText continuation:\nbit so it's flush, and start over. \nThe first one I put in breaks half way while screwing it in.\nTo describe it, there's an inch of non-screw near the head, and an inch of screwy-ridges near the tip. they're copper coloured, and the sheared inside looks silver. The dust-cover box they came in says \"multi-purpose and flooring\".\nSo, the door is aligned the way it needs to be to not scrape the grass when opened, and now there's a broken screw jutting out where I need to put an actual whatever-type-of-fastener.\nHelp? Can I just use nails? Does it need to be these crappy screws? Are the screws at fault, or it is just too cold out to do this stuff?\n\nEdit : Also, if there's any suggestions on removing screws from a post that broke off and have been cut flush to the wood, I would love them.\njakkarth: Use vice grip pliers to remove the broken screw. Screws will last a lot longer than nails if you can manage to get them installed. The kind of screws you want are \"decking\" or \"exterior coated\" screws. If you have trouble driving them in, use a 1/8\" drill bit to predrill the holes. Go about the length of the screw minus half an inch deep with the drill bit, then drive the screw in the hole.\n[deleted]: Yeah, no exterior coated anything. A few rust coated screws about the same size/shape that I could clean off. \nThe nails are left-overs from when we (my neighbors and beer) put together a patio, but I can only assume (because the neighbour got them, not us) that they were rated for outdoors.\njakkarth: If they're not coated, they'll rot/rust. That'll lead to poor structural performance (your fence falls apart) and discoloration (black stains trailing down from the screw heads). In some cases the exterior rated screws are also stronger than their interior counterparts.\n[deleted]: What i'm taking from that is \"Exterior coated nails, though inferior to exterior coated screws, are preferable to interior coated screws\"?\njakkarth: That is my recommendation, yes. I would not build a fence for my mother using anything less than exterior coated screws, but given a choice between galvanized/exterior nails and drywall/interior screws, I'd go with the nails.\n[deleted]: Thanks, your mother is a lucky lady. I'm going to grab some exterior screws later in the day, and make sure to drill in some holes before I try to install 'em.\nAlso, the pliers didn't work to pull out the screw, it just stripped the screw more. So I cut it off. Is that \"ok\", or are there screw-removal pliers is should look into?\njakkarth: I'd probably leave it. The [vice grip](http://tungstencarbidefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/vicegrip.jpg) pliers are my go-to for removing screws with broken-off heads, so if that didn't work you're probably better off just cutting it off.

It can deal with general deterministic planning problems encoded in the propositional fragment of PDDL2.2, including advanced features like ADL conditions and effects and derived predicates (axioms). Like other well-known planners such as HSP and FF, Fast Downward is a progression planner, searching the space of world states of a planning task in the forward direction. However, unlike other PDDL planning systems, Fast Downward does not use the propositional PDDL representation of a planning task directly. Instead, the input is first translated into an alternative representation called multi-valued planning tasks, which makes many of the implicit constraints of a propositional planning task explicit. Exploiting this alternative\n\nText continuation:\nrepresentation, Fast Downward can handle planning problems that are difficult or impossible to solve using traditional propositional planning systems.\nOne of the key features of Fast Downward is its ability to handle planning problems with complex constraints and effects. This is achieved through the use of a sophisticated planning algorithm that can efficiently explore the search space of possible solutions. The algorithm is based on a combination of heuristic search and constraint propagation, which allows it to prune the search space and focus on the most promising regions.\nFast Downward has been successfully applied to a wide range of planning problems, including problems from robotics, logistics, and manufacturing. It has also been used to solve complex planning problems that involve multiple agents and uncertain environments. In addition, Fast Downward has been integrated with other planning systems and tools, such as planning languages and planning domains, to provide a comprehensive planning solution.\nOverall, Fast Downward is a powerful and flexible planning system that can handle a wide range of planning problems. Its ability to handle complex constraints and effects, combined with its efficient planning algorithm, make it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"b\"?

We extend our earlier discussion of the causal graph heuristic to tasks involving axioms and conditional effects and present some novel techniques for search control that are used within Fast Downwards best-first search algorithm: preferred operators transfer the idea of helpful actions from local search to global best-first search, deferred evaluation of heuristic functions mitigates the negative effect of large branching factors on search performance, and multi-heuristic best-first search combines several heuristic evaluation functions within a single search algorithm in an orthogonal way. We also describe efficient data structures for fast state expansion (successor generators and axiom evaluators) and present a new non-heuristic search algorithm called focused iterative-broadening search, which utilizes the information encoded in causal graphs in a novel way. Fast Downward has proven remarkably successful: It won the \"classical (i.e., propositional, non-optimising) track of the 4th International Planning Competition at ICAPS 2004, following in the footsteps of planners such as FF and LPG. Our experiments show that it also performs very well on the benchmarks of the earlier planning competitions and provide some insights about the usefulness of the new search enhancements.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Grenada\"?

When the population totals of some auxiliary variables are known and when the inclusion probabilities are known by design, survey statisticians have developed calibration methods for improving efficiencies of the inverse probability weighting estimators and the methods can be applied to missing data analysis. Model-based calibration has been proposed in the survey sampling literature, where multidimensional auxiliary variables are first summarized into a predictor function from a working regression model. Usually, one working model is being proposed for each parameter of interest and results in different sets of calibration weights for\n\nText continuation:\neach parameter.\nThese calibration weights can be used to adjust the estimated means and totals of the auxiliary variables to match the known population totals, thereby improving the accuracy of the estimates. The calibration process can also be used to account for complex survey designs, such as stratification and clustering, by incorporating these design effects into the working model. Furthermore, the calibration weights can be used to adjust for non-response bias by weighting the complete cases by the inverse of the non-response probability.\nIn addition to the model-based calibration, other calibration methods have also been proposed, such as propensity score calibration and density ratio calibration. These methods are based on different assumptions and can be used in different contexts, such as when the inclusion probabilities are unknown or when the auxiliary variables are not available. The choice of calibration method depends on the specific survey design and the nature of the missing data.\nThe calibration methods can be applied to various types of survey data, including cross-sectional and longitudinal data, and can be used to estimate a wide range of parameters, such as population means, totals, and proportions. The methods can also be used to adjust for non-response bias in complex surveys, such as those with multiple stages of selection and non-response. Overall, the calibration methods provide a powerful tool for improving the accuracy and efficiency of survey estimates, and can be used in a variety of applications, including health surveys, economic surveys, and social surveys.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"p\"?

This paper considers calibration using multiple working regression models for estimating a single or multiple parameters. Contrary to a common belief that overfitting hurts efficiency, we present three rather unexpected results. First, when the missing probability is correctly specified and multiple working regression models for the conditional mean are posited, calibration enjoys an oracle property: the same semiparametric efficiency bound is attained as if the true outcome model is known in advance. Second, when the missing data mechanism is misspecified, calibration can still be a consistent estimator when any one of the outcome regression models is correctly specified. Third, a common set of calibration weights can be used to improve efficiency in estimating multiple parameters of interest and can simultaneously attain semiparametric efficiency bounds for all parameters of interest. We provide connections of a wide class of calibration estimators, constructed based on generalized empirical likelihood, to many existing estimators in biostatistics, econometrics and survey sampling and perform simulation studies to show that the finite sample properties of calibration estimators conform well with the theoretical results being studied.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Montenegro\"?

None of the starts were written by you. Half of the continuations were written by you and half were written by someone else, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"p\".\n\nText start:\nThe influence of cooling rate on the intensity of thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) and the necessity to correct archaeo/palaeointensities for this effect have long been recognized. However the reliability of the correction is still questioned. We studied 35 bricks baked in two modern kilns (SK and BK) in known experimental conditions and with measurements of the direction and intensity of the geomagnetic field at the site. The smallest kiln (SK, 0.2 m 3) cooled in around 12 hours and the biggest kiln (BK, 8 m 3) in around 40 hours. Thermomagnetic, hysteresis and backfield curves indicated that the main magnetic carriers were Ti-poor titanomagnetites and Tipoortitanohematites. The fraction of the TRM carried by Ti-poor titanohematites is the maindifference between the two sets of bricks. This\n\nText continuation:\ndifference is likely to be responsible for the observed variations in TRM intensity and direction. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the relationship between cooling rate and TRM intensity, as well as to develop a reliable method for correcting archaeo/palaeointensities for this effect. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering the cooling rate of a sample when interpreting TRM data, and demonstrate the need for careful consideration of the experimental conditions under which the sample was baked.\nIn this study, we have demonstrated the significant impact of cooling rate on the intensity of TRM, and the need for careful consideration of this effect when interpreting TRM data. The results of this study have important implications for the field of archaeomagnetic dating, and highlight the need for further research into the relationship between cooling rate and TRM intensity. The use of modern kilns to simulate the conditions under which ancient ceramics were baked provides a valuable tool for understanding the magnetic properties of these materials, and can help to improve the accuracy of archaeomagnetic dating. By combining this approach with careful consideration of the experimental conditions under which the sample was baked, it is possible to develop a more accurate and reliable method for correcting archaeo/palaeointensities for the effect of cooling rate.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"p\"?

None of the starts were written by you. Half of the continuations were written by you and half were written by someone else, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation mentions the country \"Latvia\".\n\nText start:\nThe influence of cooling rate on the intensity of thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) and the necessity to correct archaeo/palaeointensities for this effect have long been recognized. However the reliability of the correction is still questioned. We studied 35 bricks baked in two modern kilns (SK and BK) in known experimental conditions and with measurements of the direction and intensity of the geomagnetic field at the site. The smallest kiln (SK, 0.2 m 3) cooled in around 12 hours and the biggest kiln (BK, 8 m 3) in around 40 hours. Thermomagnetic, hysteresis and backfield curves indicated that the main magnetic carriers were Ti-poor titanomagnetites and Tipoortitanohematites. The fraction of the TRM carried by Ti-poor titanohematites is the maindifference between the two sets of bricks. This\n\nText continuation:\nfraction is around 5-10% in bricks from BK kilnand up to 40% in those from SK kiln. Intensities of the Earth's magnetic field were determinedusing the original Thellier-Thellier protocol with correction of TRM anisotropy. The averageintensities overestimate the expected field intensity by 5% (SK) and 6% (BK). This resultemphasizes the necessity of the cooling rate correction. In order to have a detailed evaluation ofthe cooling rate effect, we used several slow cooling rates: 0.8, 0.4, 0.2 and 0.1{\\textdegree}C/min. Thecorrection factors obtained with the 0.8{\\textdegree}C/min cooling ranged between -2% and 21% and wereproportional to the TRM fraction carried by Ti-poor titanohematite. The higher proportion ofthese grains in bricks from SK kiln led to an overestimate of the correction factor and anunderestimate of the intensity by 7%. However, the expected intensity is recovered whentemperature steps higher than 580{\\textdegree}C (i.e. in the range of Ti-poor titanohematites unblockingtemperatures) were excluded from the calculation of archaeointensity and cooling rate correction.In the case of the BK kiln bricks, for which Ti-poor titanohematites does not contributesignificantly to the TRM, all tested cooling rates give average intensities close to the expectedvalue. Incorrectly estimating the duration of the archaeological cooling has therefore a lowimpact on the accuracy of the archaeointensity data on these kinds of material.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Latvia\"?

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"y\".\n\nText start:\nWe use Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS), with an original analysis method, to obtain both the characteristic sizes and the inner composition of lysozyme-pectin complexes depending on the charge density. Lysozyme is a globular protein and pectin a natural anionic semiflexible polysaccharide with a degree of methylation (DM) 0, 43 and 74. For our experimental conditions (buffer ionic strength I = 2.5 10-2 mol/L and pH between 3 and 7), the electrostatic charge of lysozyme is always positive (from 8 to 17 depending on pH). The pectin charge per elementary chain segment is negative and can be varied from almost zero to one through the change of DM and pH. The weight molar ratio of lysozyme on pectin monomers is kept constant. The ratio of negative charge content per volume to positive charge\n\nText continuation:\ncontent per volume is also kept constant. This allows us to study the effect of charge density on the structure and composition of the complexes.\nThe SANS experiments were performed using a neutron beam with a wavelength of 6 \u00c5. The scattered intensity was measured as a function of the scattering angle, and the data were analyzed using a model-independent approach. The results show that the size of the complexes increases with increasing charge density, with a maximum size of approximately 100 \u00c5 observed for the complexes with the highest charge density. The composition of the complexes also changes with increasing charge density, with a higher proportion of pectin observed in the complexes with the highest charge density.\nThe results of the SANS experiments are consistent with the idea that the charge density of the complexes plays a crucial role in determining their size and composition. The electrostatic interactions between the positively charged lysozyme and the negatively charged pectin are strong enough to overcome the entropy-driven association of the two molecules, resulting in the formation of stable complexes. The charge density of the complexes also affects the structure of the pectin chain, with a higher charge density resulting in a more extended chain conformation.\nThe study of the lysozyme-pectin complexes using SANS provides valuable insights into the role of charge density in determining the structure and composition of these complexes. The results have important implications for the design of new biomaterials and biotechnological applications, where the control of charge density can be used to modulate the properties of the materials.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"y\"?

Lysozyme is a globular protein and pectin a natural anionic semiflexible polysaccharide with a degree of methylation (DM) 0, 43 and 74.

The pectin charge per elementary chain segment is negative and can be varied from almost zero to one through the change of DM and pH. The weight molar ratio of lysozyme on pectin monomers is kept constant. The ratio of negative charge content per volume to positive charge\n\nText continuation:\ncontent per volume, -/+, is varied between 10 and 0.007. On a local scale, for all charged pectins, a correlation peak appears at 0.2 {\\AA}-1 due to proteins clustering inside the complexes. On a large scale, the complexes appear as formed of spherical globules with a well defined radius of 10 to 50 nm, containing a few thousands proteins. The volume fraction Phi of organic matter within the globules derived from SANS absolute cross-sections is around 0.1. The protein stacking, which occurs inside the globules, is enhanced when pectin is more charged, due to pH or DM. The linear charge density of the pectin determines the size of the globules for pectin chains of comparable molecular weights whether it is controlled by the pH or the DM. The radius of the globules varies between 10 nm and 50 nm. In conclusion the structure is driven by electrostatic interactions and not by hydrophobic interactions. The molecular weight also has a large influence on the structure of the complexes since long chains tend to form larger globules. This maybe one reason why DM and pH are not completely equivalent in our system since DM 0 has a short mass, but this may not be the only one. For very low pectin charge (-/+ = 0.07), globules do not appear and the scattering signals a gel-like structure. We did not observe any beads-on-a-string structure.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Namibia\"?

At that time, the group generated revenue of \u00a32.2 billion and had a workforce of 34,721 people.\nThe company was founded in 1884 as the London and Tilbury Lighterage Company Limited. From 1991, it was known as Tilbury Douglas following a merger with RM Douglas, but in 2001 it rebranded as Interserve plc. The name change partly reflected a shift in focus during the 1990s towards maintenance and facilities management services sectors, and this continued in the 2000s, buoyed by further acquisitions.\nHowever, financial issues including problem contracts in Interserve's energy-from-waste business led to profit warnings\n\nText continuation:\n, which ultimately contributed to the company's decline. Despite efforts to restructure and refinance, Interserve was unable to recover and was forced to enter administration in 2019. The company's assets were subsequently sold off, and many of its former employees were left without jobs.\nIn the years that followed, Interserve's legacy continued to be felt in the construction and support services sectors. The company's former subsidiaries and divisions were acquired by other businesses, and many of its former employees went on to find new roles. Meanwhile, the company's former headquarters in Reading, Berkshire, was redeveloped and is now home to a number of other businesses.\nDespite the challenges it faced, Interserve's history is a testament to the company's resilience and adaptability. From its humble beginnings as a lighterage company to its later years as a major player in the construction and support services sectors, Interserve played an important role in shaping the UK's built environment. As the company looks to the future, its legacy will continue to be felt for many years to come.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"p\"?

At that time, the group generated revenue of \u00a32.2 billion and had a workforce of 34,721 people.\nThe company was founded in 1884 as the London and Tilbury Lighterage Company Limited. From 1991, it was known as Tilbury Douglas following a merger with RM Douglas, but in 2001 it rebranded as Interserve plc. The name change partly reflected a shift in focus during the 1990s towards maintenance and facilities management services sectors, and this continued in the 2000s, buoyed by further acquisitions.\nHowever, financial issues including problem contracts in Interserve's energy-from-waste business led to profit warnings\n\nText continuation:\nin 2017. The company was forced to restructure and refinance in March 2018. After its financial situation worsened in late 2018, debt holders discussed further financial restructuring of the business. A debt-for-equity plan was rejected in March 2019, and Interserve plc went into administration owing creditors over \u00a3100m. In a pre-pack deal, the rest of the group was immediately sold to a newly incorporated company owned by lenders, Interserve Group Ltd, and a break-up of the company followed. Interserve's facilities management business was sold to Mitie in December 2020, and RMD Kwikform was sold in October 2021 to France's Altrad.\nIn March 2021, Interserve resurrected the Tilbury Douglas brand for its construction and engineering services businesses. Interserve plc was formally wound-up in the High Court in January 2022. In June 2022, Tilbury Douglas fully separated from Interserve Group and became a standalone construction contracting company. Some smaller assets are expected to be sold before Interserve Group is finally shut down in 2024. In October 2022, Interserve was fined \u00a34.4 million for a breach of data protection law in May 2020.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Gabon\"?

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary contains the letter \"g\".\n\nArticle:\nFourteen-year-old piano prodigy, K\u014dsei Arima, becomes famous after winning several music competitions. When his mother Saki dies, K\u014dsei has a mental breakdown while performing at a piano recital; this results in him becoming unable to hear the sound of his piano, even though his hearing is otherwise unaffected.\nTwo years later, K\u014dsei has not touched the piano and views the world in monochrome. He does not focus on excelling in any activities and often spends time with his friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ry\u014dta Watari. K\u014dsei meets Kaori Miyazono, an audacious, free-spirited, fourteen-year-old violinist whose playing style reflects her manic personality. Kaori helps K\u014dsei return to playing the piano, and shows him his playing style can be free and groundbreaking. As Kaori continues to uplift K\u014dsei's spirits, he quickly realizes he loves her, although she seems to only be interested in Ry\u014dta.\nDuring a performance, Kaori, who later explains that she is anemic and needs routine testing, collapses and is hospitalized. She is later diagnosed with Aplastic Anemia. She invites K\u014dsei to play with her at a gala but she does not arrive. Her health deteriorates and she becomes dejected. K\u014dsei plays a duet with a friend, which motivates Kaori to attempt a risky and potentially deadly surgery so she may possibly play with Kosei once more. While playing in the finals of the Eastern Japan Piano Competition, K\u014dsei sees Kaori's spirit accompanying him and realizes she has died during the surgery.\nAt her funeral, Kaori's parents give K\u014dsei a letter from Kaori that reveals she was aware of her impending death and became more free-spirited, both as a person and in her music, so she would not take her regrets to Heaven. She confesses she had been in love with K\u014dsei's piano playing since watching him perform at a concert when she was five. This inspired her to play the violin so she could play with him one day. Kaori fabricated her feelings towards Ry\u014dta so she could get closer to K\u014dsei without hurting Tsubaki, who harbored affection for K\u014dsei. She then confesses her love for him. Tsubaki comforts K\u014dsei and tells him she will be by his side. Kaori also leaves behind a picture of herself as a child, coming back from the concert that inspired her, with K\u014dsei in the background. K\u014dsei later frames this picture.\n\nSummary:\nYour Lie in April is a story about a 14-year-old piano prodigy named K\u014dsei Arima who loses his ability to hear music after his mother's death. He meets a free-spirited violinist named Kaori Miyazono who helps him regain his passion for music and eventually falls in love with him. However, Kaori is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness and eventually passes away, leaving K\u014dsei to come to terms with his grief and the realization that Kaori had been in love with him all along.\n\nDoes this summary contain the letter \"g\"?

Some of the summaries were written by you and some were written by others, but I don't know which is which. The instructions to the summary writer were: \"What is Your Lie in April about?\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary mentions the country \"Finland\".\n\nArticle:\nFourteen-year-old piano prodigy, K\u014dsei Arima, becomes famous after winning several music competitions. When his mother Saki dies, K\u014dsei has a mental breakdown while performing at a piano recital; this results in him becoming unable to hear the sound of his piano, even though his hearing is otherwise unaffected.\nTwo years later, K\u014dsei has not touched the piano and views the world in monochrome. He does not focus on excelling in any activities and often spends time with his friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ry\u014dta Watari. K\u014dsei meets Kaori Miyazono, an audacious, free-spirited, fourteen-year-old violinist whose playing style reflects her manic personality. Kaori helps K\u014dsei return to playing the piano, and shows him his playing style can be free and groundbreaking. As Kaori continues to uplift K\u014dsei's spirits, he quickly realizes he loves her, although she seems to only be interested in Ry\u014dta.\nDuring a performance, Kaori, who later explains that she is anemic and needs routine testing, collapses and is hospitalized. She is later diagnosed with Aplastic Anemia. She invites K\u014dsei to play with her at a gala but she does not arrive. Her health deteriorates and she becomes dejected. K\u014dsei plays a duet with a friend, which motivates Kaori to attempt a risky and potentially deadly surgery so she may possibly play with Kosei once more. While playing in the finals of the Eastern Japan Piano Competition, K\u014dsei sees Kaori's spirit accompanying him and realizes she has died during the surgery.\nAt her funeral, Kaori's parents give K\u014dsei a letter from Kaori that reveals she was aware of her impending death and became more free-spirited, both as a person and in her music, so she would not take her regrets to Heaven. She confesses she had been in love with K\u014dsei's piano playing since watching him perform at a concert when she was five. This inspired her to play the violin so she could play with him one day. Kaori fabricated her feelings towards Ry\u014dta so she could get closer to K\u014dsei without hurting Tsubaki, who harbored affection for K\u014dsei. She then confesses her love for him. Tsubaki comforts K\u014dsei and tells him she will be by his side. Kaori also leaves behind a picture of herself as a child, coming back from the concert that inspired her, with K\u014dsei in the background. K\u014dsei later frames this picture.\n\nSummary:\nYour Lie in April is a manga and an anime about friendship through music. The protagonist Kosei Arima is a very talented piano prodigy who goes through a mental breakdown from the pressure of performing and becomes deaf to the sound of his own piano. The world becomes monotonous and depressing until he meets Kaori Miyazono, a free-spirited violinist who reminds him of how to play music freely again. However, Kaori suffers from anemia and often has to go to the hospital. Despite this, the two often play together and Kosei falls in love. Kaori passes away soon after and leaves a letter for Kosei explaining how she loved him back and his piano playing. Kosei uses this as inspiration to get back into music and play freely once more.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Finland\"?

These materials are composed of polymer chains functionalized by strongly interacting moieties, sometimes called \"stickers\". In order to systematically investigate the effect of the presence of associative groups on the debonding properties of a supramolecular adhesive, a series of supramolecular model systems has been characterized by probe-tack tests. These model materials, composed of linear and low dispersity poly(butylacrylate) chains functionalized in the middle by a single tri-urea sticker, are able to self-associate by six hydrogen bonds and range in molecular weight (M n) between 5 and 85 kg/mol. The linear rheology and the nanostructure of the same materials (called \"PnBA3U\") was\n\nText continuation:\ncharacterized using various techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The results showed that the presence of the tri-urea sticker significantly affects the viscoelastic properties of the material, with the highest molecular weight samples exhibiting the highest storage modulus and the lowest loss tangent. This is attributed to the formation of a more extensive hydrogen-bonded network, which enhances the material's mechanical properties.\nFurther investigation revealed that the debonding properties of the PnBA3U materials are strongly dependent on the molecular weight and the concentration of the tri-urea sticker. The highest molecular weight samples showed the highest debonding forces, which can be attributed to the increased number of hydrogen bonds and the more extensive network formation. The concentration of the tri-urea sticker also played a crucial role, with the highest concentration samples exhibiting the highest debonding forces. This suggests that the presence of multiple stickers can enhance the material's adhesive properties by increasing the number of hydrogen bonds and the network formation.\nThe results of this study provide valuable insights into the design of supramolecular adhesives with tunable properties. The ability to control the molecular weight and the concentration of the tri-urea sticker allows for the tailoring of the material's viscoelastic and debonding properties. This could lead to the development of innovative adhesives with improved performance and versatility, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, from biomedical devices to consumer products.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"e\"?

At room temperature, the association of polymers via hydrogen bonds induces the formation of rod-like aggregates structured into bundles for M n \\textless{} 40kg/mol and the behavior of a soft elastic material was observed (G'\\textgreater{}\\textgreater{}G \"and G'~$\\omega$ 0). For higher M n , the filaments were randomly oriented and polymers displayed a crossover towards viscous behavior although terminal relaxation was not reached in the experimental frequency window. All these materials show however similar adhesive properties characterized by a cohesive mode of failure and low debonding energies (W adh \\textless{}40J/m 2 for a debonding speed of 100$\\mu$m/s). The debonding mechanisms observed during the adhesion tests have been investigated in detail with an Image tools analysis developed by our group 3. The measure of the projected area covered by cavities growing in the adhesive layer during debonding can be used to estimate the true stress in the walls of the cavities and thus, to characterize the in-situ large strain deformation of the thin layer during the adhesion test itself. This analysis revealed in particular that the PnBA3U materials with M n \\textless{} 40 kg/mol soften very markedly at large deformation like yield stress fluids, explaining the low adhesion energies measured for these viscoelastic gels. 2\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Lesotho\"?

Integrative optical detector A 2nd generation of Time-Resolved Integrative Optical Neutron (TRION) detector was developed. It is based on an integrative optical technique, which permits fast-neutron energy-resolved imaging via time-gated optical readout. This mode of operation allows loss-free operation at very high neutron-flux intensities. The TRION neutron imaging system can be regarded as a stroboscopic photography of neutrons arriving at the detector on a few-ns time scale. As this spectroscopic capability is based on the Time-of-Flight (TOF) technique, it has to be operated in conjunction with a pulsed neutron source, such as an ion accelerator producing 1-2 ns wide beam pulses at MHz repetition rates. TRION is capable of\n\nText continuation:\nproviding high-resolution images of neutron-absorbing materials, which is crucial for various applications in fields like nuclear engineering, materials science, and biological research. The system's ability to operate at high flux intensities makes it an attractive tool for studying dynamic processes, such as chemical reactions and phase transitions, which are often accompanied by significant changes in neutron scattering patterns.\nBy combining TRION with advanced data analysis techniques, researchers can gain insights into the underlying physics of complex systems and materials. For instance, the system can be used to study the behavior of nuclear reactors, where the detection of neutron fluxes and energy spectra is crucial for safety and performance monitoring. Additionally, TRION can be employed to investigate the properties of novel materials, such as superconductors and nanomaterials, which exhibit unique neutron scattering patterns that can be exploited for advanced applications. The development of TRION and other optical neutron detectors has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of complex systems and materials, enabling breakthroughs in fields like energy, medicine, and materials science.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"i\"?

Neutron energy spectrometry is based on event-by-event detection and reconstruction of neutron energy from the measurement of the recoil proton track projection length and the amount of light produced in the track. In addition, the detector can provide fast-neutron imaging with position resolution of tens of microns. The detector principle of operation, simulations and experimental results obtained with a small detector prototype are described. Track-imaging of individual recoil protons from incident neutrons in the range of 2-14 MeV are demonstrated as well as preliminary results of detector spectroscopic capabilities.

While data analytics used to be mainly performed on cloud infrastructures, the rapid development of IoT infrastructures and the requirements for low-latency, secure processing has motivated the development of edge analytics. Today, to balance various trade-offs, ML-based analytics tends to increasingly leverage an interconnected ecosystem that allows complex applications to be executed on hybrid infrastructures where IoT Edge devices are interconnected to Cloud/HPC systems in what is called the Computing Continuum, the Digital Continuum, or the Transcontinuum.Enabling learning-based analytics on\n\nText continuation:\nthese hybrid infrastructures requires advanced data processing and management capabilities, as well as robust security and networking solutions. This necessitates the development of new software frameworks and tools that can efficiently handle the complexities of distributed data processing, data fusion, and data analytics.\nOne such approach is the use of containerization and orchestration technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, to manage the deployment and scaling of ML workloads across hybrid infrastructures. These technologies enable the creation of portable, self-contained environments for ML applications, allowing them to be easily deployed and managed across different environments. Additionally, the use of cloud-native technologies, such as serverless computing and cloud-based data lakes, can provide scalable and cost-effective data processing and storage capabilities.\nAnother key aspect of enabling learning-based analytics on hybrid infrastructures is the development of advanced data processing and management capabilities. This includes the use of data streaming technologies, such as Apache Kafka and Apache Flink, to handle real-time data processing and analytics. Additionally, the use of distributed data processing frameworks, such as Apache Spark and Hadoop, can provide scalable and fault-tolerant data processing capabilities.\nFurthermore, the development of robust security and networking solutions is crucial for ensuring the secure processing and transmission of sensitive data across hybrid infrastructures. This includes the use of encryption technologies, such as SSL/TLS and AES, to protect data in transit and at rest. Additionally, the use of access control and authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth and Kerberos, can provide secure access to data and applications.\nIn conclusion, enabling learning-based analytics on hybrid infrastructures requires the development of advanced data processing and management capabilities, as well as robust security and networking solutions. By leveraging containerization and orchestration technologies, cloud-native technologies, data streaming technologies, distributed data processing frameworks, and robust security and networking solutions, organizations can create scalable, secure, and efficient hybrid infrastructures for ML-based analytics.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"f\"?

While data analytics used to be mainly performed on cloud infrastructures, the rapid development of IoT infrastructures and the requirements for low-latency, secure processing has motivated the development of edge analytics. Today, to balance various trade-offs, ML-based analytics tends to increasingly leverage an interconnected ecosystem that allows complex applications to be executed on hybrid infrastructures where IoT Edge devices are interconnected to Cloud/HPC systems in what is called the Computing Continuum, the Digital Continuum, or the Transcontinuum.Enabling learning-based analytics on\n\nText continuation:\nsuch complex infrastructures is challenging. The large scale and optimized deployment of learning-based workflows across the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum requires extensive and reproducible experimental analysis of the application execution on representative testbeds. This is necessary to help understand the performance trade-offs that result from combining a variety of learning paradigms and supportive frameworks. A thorough experimental analysis requires the assessment of the impact of multiple factors, such as: model accuracy, training time, network overhead, energy consumption, processing latency, among others.This review aims at providing a comprehensive vision of the main state-of-the-art libraries and frameworks for machine learning and data analytics available today. It describes the main learning paradigms enabling learning-based analytics on the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum. The main simulation, emulation, deployment systems, and testbeds for experimental research on the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum available today are also surveyed. Furthermore, we analyze how the selected systems provide support for experiment reproducibility. We conclude our review with a detailed discussion of relevant open research challenges and of future directions in this domain such as: holistic understanding of performance; performance optimization of applications;efficient deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) workflows on highly heterogeneous infrastructures; and reproducible analysis of experiments on the Computing Continuum.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Uruguay\"?

I recently experienced not having anybody to talk to as it was really late at night (3-4 am), but really felt the need to do so as I was going through a crisis for a recent breakup, so I instead called the suicide hotline as I knew you can call them in case of non-emergency situations too. I talked to someone and they were super helpful and supportive and really helped me not feel alone.Towards the end of the call I asked them if there was an alternative solution as I didn\u2019t want to risk occupying a line in case\n\nText continuation:\nof an emergency. They told me about the warm lines and how they are usually more relaxed and can be used for casual conversations. I was skeptical at first, but decided to give it a try. I ended up calling a warm line and was connected to a wonderful person who listened to me vent about my breakup and offered words of encouragement. It was amazing to have someone to talk to and I felt a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"o\"?

I recently experienced not having anybody to talk to as it was really late at night (3-4 am), but really felt the need to do so as I was going through a crisis for a recent breakup, so I instead called the suicide hotline as I knew you can call them in case of non-emergency situations too. I talked to someone and they were super helpful and supportive and really helped me not feel alone.Towards the end of the call I asked them if there was an alternative solution as I didn\u2019t want to risk occupying a line in case\n\nText continuation:\nsomeone in an emergency was trying to call, and they told me about the existence of \"warm lines\". Hope this helps. Talking to other human beings really helps.\n[List of warm lines](https://screening.mhanational.org/content/need-talk-someone-warmlines/)\nKimjongnacca: I've been brought back from the brink by using warmlines. They can help.\nunique_user43: What service did you use?\nKimjongnacca: The warmline phone numbers are location based.  I lived in New Jersey in the USA, and I called the Mental Health Association in New Jersey,  Inc. at  [1-877-292-5588](https://www.mhanj.org/our-call-lines/).\nDo a search to find the one in your area. There is no limit to the number of times you can call or to what you can say. Speaking to someone who has been through what you're going through is like being cradled in true understanding. \n\nMental Health America has a good [list](https://screening.mhanational.org/content/need-talk-someone-warmlines/) of warmlines in the United States.\nelastic-craptastic: As a paranoid depressive, do they demand personal info?  I don't want a log kept on me without express permission.\nKimjongnacca: They make no intrusive demands of you. However, they need some personal info because they keep in touch. They do follow-up calls to make sure you're still OK later. They confer with each other to make sure you're being helped effectively. If they think you are a serious threat to yourself or others, they can send someone to help you; but it's almost exclusively just you having a conversation with an empathetic peer. \nBe well my friend.\nelastic-craptastic: I just don't wanna be a debbie downer to my friends but have no one that understands my personal struggles.   They are very specific, and though we all go through shit, I feel like my shit is pretty unique.\nBut I don't want my needing to bitch turn into a DSS case as I still take care of my family.  Mental health and stress has ruined families because they have asked for help, in my personal experience. I've seen it and it's better to shut up and suffer than deal with them.\nKimjongnacca: A warmline sounds like an excellent outlet for you.\nelastic-craptastic:  \nThanks for the input.  No promises but I'll try.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Sweden\"?

If one rows with poor technique, especially rowing with a curved rather than straight back, other injuries may surface, including back pains and wrist injuries. Blisters occur for almost all rowers, especially in the beginning of one's rowing career, as every stroke puts pressure on the hands, though rowing frequently tends to harden hands and generate protective calluses. Holding the oars too tightly or making adjustments to technique may cause recurring or new blisters, as it is common to feather the blade. Another common injury is getting \"track bites\", thin cuts on the back of one's calf or thigh caused by contact with the seat tracks at either end of the stroke.\n\nSummary:\nThe most common rowing injuries are inflammation of the knee joints, spine, and forearm tendons.\n\nDoes this summary contain the letter \"w\"?

None of the starts were written by you. Half of the continuations were written by you and half were written by someone else, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"a\".\n\nText start:\nInterest in the application of engineering methods to problems in congenital heart disease has gained increased popularity over the past decade. The use of computational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single ventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of pacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the biomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing in clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In practice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each other's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD) the main steps involved in performing\n\nText continuation:\ncomputational simulations.\nThe first step is to define the problem and identify the specific clinical question being addressed. This requires a thorough understanding of the patient's anatomy and physiology, as well as the relevant clinical data. Next, the computational model is developed, which involves creating a digital representation of the patient's heart and blood vessels. This is typically done using specialized software and involves a range of techniques, including finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics.\nOnce the model is developed, it can be used to simulate various scenarios and predict the outcomes of different treatments. This allows clinicians to test different approaches and make informed decisions about the best course of action. The simulations can also be used to identify potential complications and develop strategies for mitigating them.\nIn addition to its clinical applications, computational simulation can also be used to advance our understanding of the underlying biology of congenital heart disease. For example, simulations can be used to study the effects of genetic mutations on heart development and function, or to investigate the role of environmental factors in the development of CHD.\nOverall, the use of computational simulation in the study of congenital heart disease has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach diagnosis and treatment. By providing a powerful tool for predicting outcomes and identifying potential complications, simulations can help clinicians make more informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"a\"?

The use of computational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single ventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of pacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the biomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing in clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In practice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each other's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD) the main steps involved in performing\n\nText continuation:\ncomputational simulation-from the selection of an appropriate clinical question/problem to understanding the computational results, and all of the \"black boxes\" in between. We examine the current state of the art and areas in need of continued development. For example, medical image-based model-building software has been developed based on numerous different methods. However, none of them can be used to construct a model with a simple \"click of a button\". The creation of a faithful, representative anatomic model, especially in pediatric subjects, often requires skilled manual intervention. In addition, information from a second imaging modality is often required to facilitate this process. We describe the technical aspects of model building, provide a definition of some of the most commonly used terms and techniques (e.g. meshes, mesh convergence, Navier-Stokes equations, and boundary conditions), and the assumptions used in running the simulations. Particular attention is paid to the assignment of boundary conditions as this point is of critical importance in the current areas of research within the realm of congenital heart disease. Finally, examples are provided demonstrating how computer simulations can provide an opportunity to \"acquire\" data currently unobtainable by other modalities, with essentially no risk to patients. To illustrate these points, novel simulation examples of virtual Fontan conversion (from preoperative data to predicted postoperative state) and outcomes of different surgical designs are presented. The need for validation of the currently employed techniques and predicted results are required and the methods remain in their infancy. While the daily application of these technologies to patient-specific clinical scenarios likely remains years away, the ever increasing interest in this area among both clinicians and engineers makes its eventual use far more likely than ever before and, some could argue, only a matter of [computing] time.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Oman\"?

I had fiberglass batts over most of the attic but it looks like my living room was an addition and is completely uninsulated. The problem is the original roof comes down right at the living room wall so the only real access is from the outside through a ridge vent. \nMy house has 4 total ridge vents but only has small soffit vents around the living room and garage. There is no way to cover the soffits before adding blown in through the ridge vent. There is a small gap of about 6 inches of space between there the trusses originally come down and the living room so air should still\n\nText continuation:\nbe able to escape. \nI am planning on using a power blower to blow in the cellulose insulation through the ridge vent. I have a few questions before I start the project. First, I am worried about the dust and debris that will be created during the process. Is it possible to contain the mess or should I just accept that it will be a bit of a mess? \nSecondly, I am concerned about the risk of damage to the roof or the living room ceiling during the process. Are there any precautions I can take to minimize this risk? Finally, I am wondering if it would be better to blow in the insulation in sections or all at once. I am thinking that maybe blowing it in sections would give me better control over the process and allow me to ensure that the insulation is evenly distributed. \nI would love any advice or guidance that you can offer.

I was mistaken using the term ridge/gable as the same. However, looking at some examples I am fairly positive I have ridge venting. It was done in 2017 before I purchased the home but it has those taller shingles right at the peak. Would I be ok covering the soffit if I have gable and ridge venting?\nUniversalVoid: I would not, unless you are going to install lower gable vents or get air in some other way. There are some devices on the market to bring air in. Normally for a sealed AC'd attic space. For Ideas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRtLv4GpXQw\nAs others have mentioned, I would probably look at cutting an access hatch. Put in the insulation and either leave the access or just redo the sheet rock and repaint.\nFrom your description and pictures, I cannot tell if it's attached at all to the main house. If it is, I would think about maybe redoing it, so you do have access and air flow from the attachment to the main house for better air circulation. This is of course a much more serious project.\nYou could also put up sheet insulation onto the existing ceiling and then another layer of sheet. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A8OXUcPbiQ . This would of course lower your ceiling a bit, but give you some insulation.\nduncity_50: It is part of the main house. The problem is I can easily get to all of the attic except just a couple hundred square feet above the living room.

Construction workers unearthed ancient walls in the busy Iztapalapa neighborhood in June, and government archeologists said Wednesday they believe they may be part of the main pyramid of the Aztec city, destroyed by conquistador Hernan Cortes in the 16th century. Iztapalapa, now infamous for violent crime and drug dealing, has grown into a sprawling, poor district of the capital, obscuring the ruins. \"We knew the general location but couldn't explore because it's a big urban area,\" said government archeologist Jesus Sanchez, who is director of the site. Iztapalapa's ruler, Cuitlahuac, nearly annihilated Cortes and his Spanish troops in 1520 in what became known as the Sad Night. After eventual victory, Cortes destroyed the city. Sanchez hopes he has found the city's main pyramid just below the neighborhood's central plaza and garden. He and his team will spend more than a year investigating before deciding whether to excavate. Mexico City is littered with pre-Hispanic ruins. In October, archeologists in the city's central Zocalo square unearthed a 15th century Aztec altar and a 12-ton stone idol just yards from choking downtown traffic. The Aztecs, a warlike and deeply religious people who built monumental works, ruled an empire stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean and encompassing much of modern-day central Mexico.

For instance, emotion recognition systems can detect subtle changes in facial expressions, tone of voice, or body language to determine whether a person is happy, sad, or anxious. Biometric categorization systems, on the other hand, can analyze physical characteristics such as height, weight, or facial features to group individuals into specific categories.\nThe use of these systems raises important ethical and legal questions, particularly with regards to privacy and data protection. For instance, how can individuals be assured that their biometric data is being collected and used in a responsible and transparent manner? What measures can be taken to prevent the misuse of this data, such as identity theft or discrimination? Furthermore, how can the accuracy and reliability of these systems be ensured, particularly in cases where the stakes are high, such as in criminal investigations or national security situations?\nAs the use of AI systems continues to grow and evolve, it is essential that policymakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders work together to develop robust frameworks and guidelines for the development, deployment, and use of these systems. This includes ensuring that individuals are aware of the data being collected and used, and that they have the ability to opt-out or correct any errors. It also requires the development of robust auditing and accountability mechanisms to prevent the misuse of this data and ensure that these systems are used in a way that respects human rights and dignity.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"a\"?

We had previously studied an ionic metal-polymer composites (IPMC), which consists in an ionic polymer film such as Nafion saturated with water and coated on both sides with a thin layer of metal acting as electrodes. This system bends when it is subject to an electric field orthogonal to the film and can thus be used as an actuator. Conversely, the deflection of the film generates a potential difference between the electrodes ; the same system can therefore be used as a sensor.We have developed a ''continuous medium'' model for this system. The thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes had enabled us to establish its constitutive equations.We are currently interested\n\nText continuation:\nin exploring the potential applications of this technology in various fields, such as soft robotics, prosthetics, and biomedical devices.\nFor instance, the use of IPMC-based actuators could enable the development of soft, flexible robots that can navigate through complex environments and interact with delicate objects. In the field of prosthetics, IPMC-based sensors could be used to create prosthetic limbs that can detect and respond to subtle changes in the user's movements and intentions. In biomedical devices, IPMC-based energy harvesters could be used to power implantable devices, such as pacemakers or cochlear implants, eliminating the need for batteries and reducing the risk of complications.\nFurthermore, we are also investigating the possibility of using IPMC-based systems in energy storage and conversion applications. For example, IPMC-based supercapacitors could be used to store electrical energy generated by renewable sources, such as solar or wind power, and release it when needed. Additionally, IPMC-based fuel cells could be used to convert chemical energy into electrical energy, providing a clean and efficient source of power for vehicles and other applications.\nOverall, the potential applications of IPMC-based systems are vast and varied, and we are excited to continue exploring the possibilities of this technology and its potential to revolutionize various fields.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"w\"?

The central part of the device consists in two interpenetrating polymers playing the role of an ions reservoir. The PEDOT is polymerized on each side and forms an interpenetrating network with the two other polymers. A pseudo trilayer is obtained, the two outer layers containing the PEDOT acting as electrodes. It is then saturated with an ionic liquid. When the blade thus obtained is placed in an electric field orthogonal to its faces, the PEDOT undergoes a reduction reaction (or dedoping) on the side of the negative electrode, which attracts cations from the central part and therefore swells ; the blade ultimately bends towards the positive electrode.We have first adapted our model to this two-components system : the cations on the one hand, and the three polymers and the anions on the other hand. We have written its balance equations and thermodynamic relations first at the microscopic scale for each phase, then at the macroscopic scale for the whole material using an averaging technique. The thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes then provides its constitutive relations : a Kelvin - Voigt type stress-strain relation and generalized Fourier's and Darcy's laws. The equations obtained were applied to the case of a cantilevered blade subject to a continuous potential difference at constant temperature. The numerical resolution of the equations system enabled us to draw the profiles of the different quantities, which are very steep functions near the electrodes. We also evaluated the tip displacement and the force that must be exerted on the free end of the beam to prevent its displacement (blocking force). The results obtained are in good agreement with the experimental data published in the literature.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Armenia\"?

To be updated once the Regulation is adopted (April/May 2021) by the co-legislators. 3. Eurodac (a) Amended proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the establishment of \u2018Eurodac\u2019 for the comparison of biometric data for the effective application of Regulation (EU) XXX/XXX [Regulation on Asylum and Migration Management] and of Regulation (EU) XXX/XXX [Resettlement Regulation], for identifying an illegally staying thirdcountry national or stateless person and on requests for the comparison with Eurodac data by Member States\u2019 law enforcement authorities and Europol for law enforcement purposes and\n\nText continuation:\nfor the purposes of preventing and combating terrorism and other serious crimes, as well as for the purposes of ensuring public security and maintaining public order.\nThe proposed regulation aims to enhance the effectiveness of the Eurodac system by improving the quality and accuracy of the biometric data stored in the system, as well as by increasing the speed and efficiency of the data comparison process. To achieve this, the regulation proposes to introduce new technical and procedural requirements for the collection, storage, and comparison of biometric data, as well as for the use of Eurodac data by law enforcement authorities and Europol.\nFurthermore, the regulation proposes to strengthen the safeguards and guarantees for the protection of personal data and the rights of individuals, including the right to data protection, the right to access and rectify personal data, and the right to object to the processing of personal data. The regulation also proposes to establish a new independent authority responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the regulation and ensuring the effective and efficient functioning of the Eurodac system.\nThe proposed regulation is expected to have a significant impact on the functioning of the Eurodac system and on the ability of law enforcement authorities and Europol to effectively combat terrorism and other serious crimes. It is also expected to have an impact on the rights and freedoms of individuals, particularly in relation to the protection of personal data and the right to data protection.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"h\"?

The Canadian frigate HMCS Ville de Quebec will escort ships carrying food aid to Somalia. \"Canada is stepping up to the plate by tasking Ville de Quebec with the role of escorting World Food Programme ships to ensure their safe arrival at designated ports,\" Canadian Defense Minister Peter MacKay said in a government news release. The United Nations hunger program praised Canada for answering its call for help, and said it hoped other governments would step forward to take over from Canada once it completes its mission in a few weeks. The HMCS Ville de Quebec is a 440-foot frigate armed with torpedoes, surface-to-air missiles and other weapons, and carries a twin-engine Sea King anti-submarine helicopter. Ville de Quebec, which can travel at speeds greater than 27 knots, will be dispatched after Somalia's transitional government formally authorizes the mission, the government's news release said. WFP asked the world's naval powers in mid-June to help its ships reach the more than 2 million people in need of aid. It put out the request weeks before French, Danish and Dutch warships ended their escort missions, which began in November. Pirate attacks on unescorted ships have been a growing problem in Somalia. Three European freighters were hijacked off the Horn of Africa in June, adding to the 27 other reported attacks this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which tracks piracy. WFP delivers 80 percent of its aid to Somalia by sea, and WFP spokesman Peter Smerdon said that if there are no warships to escort the food supply, the program will have to rely on ground or air travel to deliver the food. But both are dangerous and expensive. The agency said that if there is no assistance from naval powers, piracy will increase, and so will death and malnutrition. Smerdon said that although Somalia's food crisis hasn't yet reached the devastation of the early 1990s, \"We're worried it will be.\"\n\nSummary:\nCanada to dispatch warship to Somalia's coast to protect UN aid ships from pirate attacks.\nHMCS Ville de Quebec will escort ships carrying food aid to Somalia's designated ports.\nThe mission aims to ensure safe arrival of aid ships and prevent pirate attacks.\nCanada's defense minister praises the move, saying it's answering the UN's call for help.\n\nDoes this summary contain the letter \"p\"?

The only reason they exist is to be of material use to Homo sapiens. It makes sense for humans to care for these animals, though I understand modern food production is blurred with profit margins, unfortunately.

Would we be willing to sacrifice the livelihoods of millions of farmers and their families, not to mention the impact on the environment and the economy? \nIt's not as simple as just abolishing livestock, as it would have far-reaching effects on our entire food system. We would need to find alternative sources of protein and nutrients, which could lead to unintended consequences such as increased reliance on industrial farming methods or the exploitation of other animal species. \nFurthermore, the idea that animals exist solely for human use is a simplistic view that neglects the complex relationships between humans and animals. Many animals have evolved alongside humans, and their existence has shaped our cultures, societies, and environments. The loss of these species would not only be a tragedy for the animals themselves but also for humanity. \nRather than seeking to eradicate livestock, perhaps we should focus on reevaluating our relationship with animals and the way we produce and consume food. We could strive for more sustainable and humane farming practices, such as regenerative agriculture, which prioritizes soil health, biodiversity, and animal welfare. \nThis approach would not only benefit the animals but also the environment, as it would promote soil carbon sequestration, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase ecosystem resilience. It would also support local communities and small-scale farmers, ensuring that the benefits of food production are shared equitably. \nIn conclusion, while the idea of a world without livestock animals may seem appealing at first glance, it is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of the consequences. Rather than seeking to eradicate animals, we should work towards a more compassionate and sustainable food system that prioritizes animal welfare, environmental stewardship, and social justice.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"c\"?

We all need to try to buy local &amp; welfare quality assured produce. \nThe death of an animal is not a big deal. Poor treatment of them while they are alive is.\nTinac4: &gt; The death of an animal is not a big deal. Poor treatment of them while they are alive is.\nHow universally do you apply this principle?\nConsider a hypothetical human society where a number of kids are raised under the best possible conditions.  All of them are happy and satisfied, until they are killed painlessly and without warning at the age of 15.  Is this ethical?  If not, what makes this scenario different?\n[deleted]: Depends on your definition of 'ethics'. I argue that it wouldn't be unethical to kill 'isolately'. To kill any living being is 'fine' as long as their death does not inflict suffering on other living beings. For example, to kill a calf would be 'wrong' because their mother would suffer by cause of their death.\nHowever, if said calf existed in isolation and their death did not cause emotional or physical harm on others \u2013 and the procedure was to be done painlessly \u2013 I can see no problem with their murder. It does not matter if it is an individual of our species or another's.\nTinac4: I personally disagree--I'm more of a preference utilitarian than a classical utilitarian--but I see where you're coming from.  It does seem to me that your position leads to some unintuitive results, though.  For instance, if you came across a sleeping homeless man, you had a method to kill him painlessly and take his money, and you knew with certainty that nobody would care about or notice his death, would it be ethical to kill him?  (Obviously, this involves a lot of simplifications that don't apply in real life.)\n[deleted]: &gt; would it be ethical to kill him?\nI suppose we're having a mature discussion here so I'm going to answer honestly. Simply put, yes. But then again, that's according to MY definition of 'ethics' as I stated in the earlier comment.\nAs long as the procedure is done in a peaceful and painless manner, I really can't see how that would be a bad thing. It may help if I clarify that I'm an atheist who doesn't believe in afterlife, so to me death isn't anything gruesome.\nTinac4: Fair enough!  I think that the scenario you described would be bad, but only on the basis of my own ethical intuitions, and those intuitions definitely aren't universal.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Tunisia\"?

The \"Barbie Bandits\" helped their hometown earn the dubious distinction as the nation's bank robbery capital. Here one of the so-called \"Barbie Bandits\" is captured on surveillance video at a surburban Atlanta bank. Atlanta's FBI field division topped Los Angeles in reporting the most bank heists, with 350 for the 12 months ending September 30, 2007, according to the FBI, which annually names areas most prone to bank robberies. The Los Angeles area was No. 2 with 338 heists, followed by Philadelphia with 316. Just Thursday, two suspects overpowered a security guard at an Atlanta, Georgia, bank, took his gun, robbed the bank and fled with money in hand, police said. Eventually, police shot one of the suspects in an exchange of gunfire. Two more armed bank robberies took place in metro Atlanta Friday. The FBI says violent crime is up across the nation, especially in major metro areas like Atlanta. So it's no surprise Atlanta has become a prime target for bank robberies, FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett told CNN.  Watch Hotlanta or Heistlanta? \u00bb . \"This goes hand in hand with those figures,\" Emmett said. Atlanta's rapid growth over the last decade has also been a factor. A recent Atlanta Business Chronicle article reported that metro Atlanta has 26 more banks than in all of North Carolina -- roughly one bank for every 3,500 people in the region.  See photos of bank heists in metro Atlanta \u00bb . \"We would attribute a lot of that [bank robberies] to the growth and the fact that the banking industry has matched that growth with an increase in bank branches throughout the area,\" Emmett said. Atlanta's rise in bank heists comes just as Los Angeles has aggressively countered once out-of-control bank robberies. Los Angeles has gone from more than 500 bank robberies in the mid-2000s to this year's 338, the FBI stats show. According to the FBI, its Atlanta field division reported 350 bank robberies in the last year -- the most notorious of which were the \"Barbie Bandits\" and \"Grandpa Bandit\" robberies. The FBI says 122 of the heists were armed robberies, or robberies where a weapon was visibly used. Emmett said many more of the robberies were what law enforcement officers classify as \"note jobs\" -- where a robber gestures as if he or she has a gun on them in a demand note handed over to the teller. Also factored into the total number of robberies were ATM heists and a record nine armored car robberies. Those armored car robberies are particularly disturbing to Emmett. \"Anyone that would confront an armored car courier knowing that he's already armed and in somewhat of a defensive posture, that mindset is very troubling for law enforcement,\" he said. While Emmett said there is no \"typical\" bank robber, he said he has seen some trends, most notably that they are often people battling drug addictions. He also said bank robbers are often repeat offenders. Two recent high-profile cases in Atlanta seem to confirm that. Two women dubbed the \"Barbie Bandits\" were arrested after working with a bank employee to rob a Bank of America in the Atlanta suburb of Acworth. They both later admitted to police to having drug addiction problems. Recently apprehended 69-year-old Bobby Joe Phillips, dubbed the \"Grandpa Bandit,\" is suspected to have robbed seven banks in Tennessee and the Atlanta area and had a criminal history. Emmett says typically very little money is taken in a bank heist. Joe Brannen, president of the Georgia Bankers Association, agrees, saying \"the average is $2,000 to $3,000. It's not as big a payoff as most people think it is.\" With the holidays in full swing, authorities are steeling themselves for a spate of bank robberies with robbers looking for quick holiday cash. \"I would make the assumption that a large part of it is the increased [financial] pressures this time of year,\" said Brannen. The FBI advises banks to be extra vigilant this time of year and to keep a close eye on jittery individuals donning gloves, hats and sunglasses. But Brannen says profiling people like that can be problematic. \"We've chosen not to go there. Here in Atlanta, lots of people wear head coverings for religious purposes. This is a free and open society,\" he said. He said customers want to come into a bank unimpeded -- that 99.9 percent are just customers, not bank robbers. Brannen says banks do all they can to balance convenience for their customers and the bank's need for security. \"There is no good, magic solution.\" he says. Emmett said as long as metro Atlanta continues to grow, so will the number of bank robberies. \"This is something that is part of growth. We have more banks. We have more people. We're a big city now.\" E-mail to a friend .

The \"Barbie Bandits\" helped their hometown earn the dubious distinction as the nation's bank robbery capital. Here one of the so-called \"Barbie Bandits\" is captured on surveillance video at a surburban Atlanta bank. Atlanta's FBI field division topped Los Angeles in reporting the most bank heists, with 350 for the 12 months ending September 30, 2007, according to the FBI, which annually names areas most prone to bank robberies. The Los Angeles area was No. 2 with 338 heists, followed by Philadelphia with 316. Just Thursday, two suspects overpowered a security guard at an Atlanta, Georgia, bank, took his gun, robbed the bank and fled with money in hand, police said. Eventually, police shot one of the suspects in an exchange of gunfire. Two more armed bank robberies took place in metro Atlanta Friday. The FBI says violent crime is up across the nation, especially in major metro areas like Atlanta. So it's no surprise Atlanta has become a prime target for bank robberies, FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett told CNN.  Watch Hotlanta or Heistlanta? \u00bb . \"This goes hand in hand with those figures,\" Emmett said. Atlanta's rapid growth over the last decade has also been a factor. A recent Atlanta Business Chronicle article reported that metro Atlanta has 26 more banks than in all of North Carolina -- roughly one bank for every 3,500 people in the region.  See photos of bank heists in metro Atlanta \u00bb . \"We would attribute a lot of that [bank robberies] to the growth and the fact that the banking industry has matched that growth with an increase in bank branches throughout the area,\" Emmett said. Atlanta's rise in bank heists comes just as Los Angeles has aggressively countered once out-of-control bank robberies. Los Angeles has gone from more than 500 bank robberies in the mid-2000s to this year's 338, the FBI stats show. According to the FBI, its Atlanta field division reported 350 bank robberies in the last year -- the most notorious of which were the \"Barbie Bandits\" and \"Grandpa Bandit\" robberies. The FBI says 122 of the heists were armed robberies, or robberies where a weapon was visibly used. Emmett said many more of the robberies were what law enforcement officers classify as \"note jobs\" -- where a robber gestures as if he or she has a gun on them in a demand note handed over to the teller. Also factored into the total number of robberies were ATM heists and a record nine armored car robberies. Those armored car robberies are particularly disturbing to Emmett. \"Anyone that would confront an armored car courier knowing that he's already armed and in somewhat of a defensive posture, that mindset is very troubling for law enforcement,\" he said. While Emmett said there is no \"typical\" bank robber, he said he has seen some trends, most notably that they are often people battling drug addictions. He also said bank robbers are often repeat offenders. Two recent high-profile cases in Atlanta seem to confirm that. Two women dubbed the \"Barbie Bandits\" were arrested after working with a bank employee to rob a Bank of America in the Atlanta suburb of Acworth. They both later admitted to police to having drug addiction problems. Recently apprehended 69-year-old Bobby Joe Phillips, dubbed the \"Grandpa Bandit,\" is suspected to have robbed seven banks in Tennessee and the Atlanta area and had a criminal history. Emmett says typically very little money is taken in a bank heist. Joe Brannen, president of the Georgia Bankers Association, agrees, saying \"the average is $2,000 to $3,000. It's not as big a payoff as most people think it is.\" With the holidays in full swing, authorities are steeling themselves for a spate of bank robberies with robbers looking for quick holiday cash. \"I would make the assumption that a large part of it is the increased [financial] pressures this time of year,\" said Brannen. The FBI advises banks to be extra vigilant this time of year and to keep a close eye on jittery individuals donning gloves, hats and sunglasses. But Brannen says profiling people like that can be problematic. \"We've chosen not to go there. Here in Atlanta, lots of people wear head coverings for religious purposes. This is a free and open society,\" he said. He said customers want to come into a bank unimpeded -- that 99.9 percent are just customers, not bank robbers. Brannen says banks do all they can to balance convenience for their customers and the bank's need for security. \"There is no good, magic solution.\" he says. Emmett said as long as metro Atlanta continues to grow, so will the number of bank robberies. \"This is something that is part of growth. We have more banks. We have more people. We're a big city now.\" E-mail to a friend .

A proper discussion was had when that article was first posted.\nKarmaDarmaSchawarma: While I agree that concrete itself is\n\nText continuation:\nnot the most efficient material for energy storage, I do think that the concept of stacking and compressing materials to store energy has potential. Perhaps we could explore other materials with better thermal conductivity or higher energy density?\ngredr: I understand what you're saying, but the article was flawed from the start. The idea of using concrete blocks as a means of energy storage is not only impractical but also inefficient. It's a solution looking for a problem.\nKarmaDarmaSchawarma: I see your point, but I think we should keep an open mind and consider alternative approaches. What if we could develop a system that combines different materials and technologies to achieve more efficient energy storage? For example, using advanced composites or nanomaterials to create a more compact and efficient energy storage device.\ngredr: I'm not opposed to exploring new ideas, but we need to be realistic about the challenges and limitations of energy storage. We can't just throw money at every new idea that comes along. We need to focus on developing technologies that are scalable, reliable, and cost-effective.\nKarmaDarmaSchawarma: I agree that we need to be practical and focus on solutions that can be implemented on a large scale. But I also think that we should continue to invest in research and development to push the boundaries of what is possible. Who knows what innovative solutions might emerge from these efforts?\ngredr: I suppose you're right. It's a delicate balance between being practical and being innovative. But let's not forget that the clock is ticking when it comes to climate change. We need to act quickly and decisively to reduce our carbon footprint and transition to a more sustainable energy future.\nKarmaDarmaSchawarma: Absolutely. The science is clear: we need to take immediate action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the worst effects of climate change. And that means investing in renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, and innovative energy storage solutions.\ngredr: Agreed. And let's not forget about the role that policy and regulation can play in driving this transition. We need strong incentives and regulations to encourage the development and deployment of clean energy technologies.\nKarmaDarmaSchawarma: That's a great point. Policy and regulation can be powerful tools in driving change. And I think that's where the real challenge lies \u2013 in convincing policymakers and regulators to take bold action to address the climate crisis.\ngredr: Well, I think that's a topic for another discussion. But for now, let's just agree that we need to keep pushing forward, exploring new ideas, and working together to create a more sustainable energy future.\nKarmaDarmaSchawarma: Absolutely.

A proper discussion was had when that article was first posted.\nKarmaDarmaSchawarma: While I agree that concrete itself is\n\nText continuation:\nactually pretty terrible for the environment, there's a plethora of materials that can be used in this application. The idea of storing energy via gravity has been around for a very long time and the science is solid. Sea water, for example, would work perfectly fine.\nDannyBlind: We call that \"hydro\" it has been done for a while already. Problem is, not everywhere is it feasible. If you want enough gravitational mass to bridge from night to day, for example solar, you need a whole bunch of mass. Next problem is if you'd only need a little bit of power. Water works great, concrete, not so much\nKayakingtheredriver: Seems to me we have a ton of old coal mines that just need a reservoir built upstream of them. Put generators all throughout the main mine shaft, and use the rest of the mine as the downward reservoir. Pump water out during the day, when you want to store energy, let the water turn the generators in the night when you want to add that energy to the grid as it fills the mine back up. Hundreds if not thousands of mine shafts all over under ground to conveniently *hide* half of the process and take up far less room, and room is always far more a problem than cost or ability.\nNewSauerKraus: The water has to go somewhere after it drops.\nKayakingtheredriver: https://www.adv-geosci.net/45/45/2018/adgeo-45-45-2018-avatar-web.png\nThat is what all the tunnels in the mine are for. The shaft is the drop to turn the turbines, the miles of tunnels at the bottom of the shaft are the storage. A mine is far, far more than the shaft. Run pipes down the shaft to the end of the mine tunnels with topside pumps to bring the water back up.\nNewSauerKraus: So your solution is to pump water up while energy is cheap, and let it flow down at night?\nKayakingtheredriver: Yep, or just *use* on site wind or solar stations to run the pumps during the day converting it into energy that is more valuable when there isn't sun and less wind at night. It is efficient, and renewable and the costs to maintain/build are far lessened because old mines have done most of the excavation for you and can be had dirt cheap, compared to building a dam and 2 reservoirs.\nNewSauerKraus: It\u2019s much cheaper, easier, and cleaner to just use a damn instead of a mine.\nKayakingtheredriver: Lol, dams are *so* easy and cheap to build huh? I will concede this water would become caustic with all the mixed in coal dust over time, but cost and and ease of build (from all the environment impact studies, what effect it will have on the river, displacement, and on and on) are far in the mine shafts favor. The mine only needs a above ground reservoir. It doesn't need an upstream or down stream river, a downstream reservoir, or displacement of land owners up/down stream or the years necessary to build all of that plus the dam. Just an upstream tank, the piped turbines (that you have to build either way) and the pump station (that you would have to build either way). None of the rest. It would cost way less in time and money.\nDannyBlind: I disagree, check my other comment. Coal dust is way more dangerous than you'd think\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Sweden\"?

The thermo-mechanical history of the samples during the mixing process was monitored and adjusted to identical final temperatures. The filler structure on large scales up to micrometers was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and very small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). A complete quantitative model extending from the primary silica nanoparticle (of radius \\approx 10 nm), to nanoparticles aggregates, up to micrometer-sized branches with typical lateral dimension of 150 nm is proposed. Image analysis of the TEM-pictures yields the fraction of zones of pure polymer, which extend between\n\nText continuation:\n10% to 30% of the total sample area. These zones are characterized by a uniform polymer matrix with a high degree of crystallinity, which is attributed to the presence of the silica nanoparticles. The remaining 70% to 90% of the sample area is composed of a complex network of polymer-silica interfaces, where the polymer chains are strongly adsorbed onto the silica surface, forming a rigid and highly ordered structure. This complex network is responsible for the remarkable mechanical and thermal properties of the nanocomposites, including their high stiffness, toughness, and thermal conductivity.\nFurthermore, the SAXS data reveal the presence of a hierarchical structure, where the primary silica nanoparticles are aggregated into larger clusters, which in turn are connected to form a three-dimensional network. This network is characterized by a high degree of porosity, which allows for the diffusion of molecules and ions through the material. The porosity is also responsible for the high surface area of the nanocomposites, which is essential for their applications in catalysis, sensing, and energy storage.\nThe proposed model provides a detailed understanding of the filler structure and its relationship with the mechanical and thermal properties of the nanocomposites. It can be used to design and optimize the properties of these materials for specific applications, such as the development of high-performance composites for aerospace and automotive industries, or the creation of novel sensors and catalysts for energy and environmental applications.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"m\"?

This network is compatible with a fractal of average dimension 2.4 as measured by scattering. On smaller length scales, inside the branches, small silica aggregates are present. Their average radius has been deduced from a Kratky analysis, and it ranges between 35 and 40 nm for all silica fractions investigated here (\\phi_si = 8-21% vol.). A central piece of our analysis is the description of the interaggregate interaction by a simulated structure factor for polydisperse spheres representing aggregates. A polydispersity of 30% in aggregate size is assumed, and interactions between these aggregates are described with a hard core repulsive potential. The same distribution in size is used to evaluate the polydisperse form factor. Comparison with the experimental intensity leads to the determination of the average aggregate compacity (assumed identical for all aggregates in the distribution, between 31% and 38% depending on \\phi_si), and thus aggregation number (ca. 45, with a large spread). Because of the effect of aggregate compacity and of pure polymer zones, the volume fraction of aggregates is higher in the branches than \\phi_si. The repulsion between aggregates has a strong effect on the apparent isothermal compressibility: it leads to a characteristic low-q depression, which cannot be interpreted as aggregate mass decrease in our data. In addition, the reinforcement effect of these silica structures in the SBR-matrix is characterized with oscillatory shear and described with a model based on the same aggregate compacity. Finally, our results show that it is possible to analyze the complex structure of interacting aggregates in nanocomposites of industrial origin in a self-consistent and quantitative manner.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Belgium\"?

He would gently pet them, talk to them in a soothing voice, and even offer them treats. It was clear that he had a deep understanding of their needs and was doing everything he could to make them feel comfortable.\nThe cheetahs, in turn, seemed to be responding positively to Dolph's efforts. They would curl up next to him, purring contentedly, and even initiate playtime by batting at his hands or pouncing on his feet. It was heartwarming to see these majestic animals, often viewed as fragile and vulnerable, thriving in their environment.\nAs I delved deeper into the world of cheetah conservation, I discovered that sanctuaries like the one Dolph was volunteering at were crucial for the survival of these incredible creatures. Many cheetahs are rescued from the wild after being orphaned or injured, and these sanctuaries provide them with a safe haven where they can receive medical care, rehabilitation, and socialization.\nIn addition to providing a safe environment, these sanctuaries also play a critical role in educating the public about the importance of cheetah conservation. By sharing their stories and experiences, volunteers like Dolph can help raise awareness about the plight of cheetahs and the efforts being made to protect them.\nAs I continued to learn more about cheetahs and the work being done to conserve them, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and respect for these incredible animals. Despite their many challenges, they continue to thrive, and with the help of dedicated volunteers and conservationists, they will continue to do so for generations to come.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"e\"?

In this video it seems like Dolph was doing the same.\nInternFearless639: What are they nervous about? Hope I\u2019m still the fastest cat when I wake up tomorrow?\nboredbrowser1: In the wild Cheetah\u2019s get bullied by pretty much everything. Most big cats are built to be ambush predators meaning that they\u2019re muscular, stocky, and sturdy, but cheetahs are built for speed meaning that they\u2019re a bit more \u201cfragile\u201d if I remember right even their spine is more flexible and less sturdy allowing for maximum stride length. On top of that a cheetah expends an absolute ton\n\nText continuation:\nof energy chasing it\u2019s prey and after killing its prey will spend a significant amount of time in the shade cooling off and recuperating energy before eating. All of this means that when a cheetah makes a kill that there\u2019s a significant amount of time where a cheetah doesn\u2019t have the energy to defend its meal nor does it had the body to stand and defend its meal anyway so it has to be on edge for any wandering hyena, leopard, lion, group of particularly irritable baboons etc. hence the eternal nervousness and on edge-ness\nwanna_try8: This describes my small house cheetah very well. She also suffers from eternal nervousness and on edge-ness \ud83d\ude15\nboredbrowser1: Yes, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the official medical diagnosis too.

Great for dogs on the 4th of July. \nI\u2019m definitely not saying to get your pets high.  It\u2019s actually designed for them and it\u2019s simply calming.  \nCan use Benadryl too.

Cost a good $250 every time she got stung.\naDrunkWithAgun: Ativan works better and cheaper\n[deleted]: Children\u2019s benedryl is like $12 in either liquid or capsules as I recall.  Don\u2019t need it myself.  \nThe expense was getting my dog into the vet for a steroid shot and to be sure that her airway wasn\u2019t blocked.\nScary driving to the vet with your beloved pet on your lap all puffed up and barely breathing.\n(Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have her anymore.)\nDefinitely will take your information though.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary mentions the country \"Comoros\".\n\nArticle:\nAstley's 50 gave the singer his first UK number one for almost 30 years.\nIt will compete for the BBC Radio 2 album of the year award with Adele's 25, Coldplay's A Head Full of Dreams, ELO's Alone in the Universe and Michael Kiwanuka's Love & Hate.\nBut there is no place on the shortlist for David Bowie's Blackstar, which came out days before his death in January.\nThe nominees were chosen by the Radio 2 playlist committee.\nThe winner will be announced at the BBC Music Awards on 12 December. The shortlists for other categories, including BBC Music British artist of the year and song of the year, will be announced shortly.\nBowie was nominated for British artist of the year at the inaugural BBC Music Awards in 2014, but lost out to Ed Sheeran.\nRick Astley has enjoyed a successful comeback this year, but if he wins the BBC Music Award it will be far from his first taste of awards glory.\nIn his first flush of fame in 1988, he won best single at the Brit Awards - as well as worst dressed person in the Smash Hits Readers' Poll.\nAnd, more improbably, at the height of the Rickrolling phenomenon he was voted the best act ever at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2008.\nTo be eligible for the BBC Music Award, albums must have been released between 17 October 2015 and 16 October 2016.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The Russian spacecraft that discovered it, Zond 3, was launched in 1965 and was designed to study the Moon's surface. The tower, which stands at an impressive height, has sparked widespread interest and speculation about its purpose and origin.\nSome experts believe that the tower could be a natural formation, created by geological processes over millions of years. Others think that it could be an artificial structure, built by an intelligent species. The possibility of extraterrestrial life is always a fascinating one, and the discovery of the tower has reignited interest in the search for life beyond Earth.\nMeanwhile, China's lunar rover, which is equipped with advanced sensors and cameras, is making its way to the tower. The rover is expected to transmit pictures and data back to Earth, which will help scientists to better understand the structure and its surroundings. The Chinese space agency has been making significant strides in recent years, and this mission is seen as a major milestone in its lunar exploration program.\nAs the world waits with bated breath for the rover's findings, the debate about the tower's origins continues to rage on. Some experts are skeptical about the possibility of extraterrestrial life, while others are more open-minded. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is certain - the discovery of the mysterious tower on the far side of the Moon has opened up a whole new frontier in space exploration and has sparked a renewed sense of wonder and curiosity about the universe.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"o\"?

You are angrily spamming this post about who discovered what and when and LITERALLY NOBODY has made a single claim against what you said. You are arguing with nobody you weirdo.\nEastCoastJeepSRT: Right, so why are you asking me why I keep responding to people? Hypocrite much? Cry to someone else. Time to block you, Chad. I will miss you though.\nImagine-being-a-mod: When did I ask you why you are responding to people? Your reading comprehension is about non-existent.

Can a blind person not truly know someone unless they can see their \"kind eyes\" or their 'wry smile'?\nPerhaps, the author would argue, a blind person would apply the concepts to auditory stimulus like the sound of their voice, their intonation, and other speech mannerism.

It's not just about the physical appearance, but the way a person carries themselves, the way they move through the world.\nBut what about the tactile sense? A blind person might develop a deep understanding of someone through touch, the way they hold their hand, the way they stroke their hair, the way they give a gentle squeeze on the shoulder. It's not just about the visual, but about the sensory experience of being with someone.\nAnd what about the emotional connection? A blind person might develop a deep emotional understanding of someone through their voice, their tone, their laughter. They might be able to sense when someone is upset, when they're happy, when they're sad. It's not just about the physical appearance, but about the emotional resonance of being with someone.\nIn fact, the article fails to address the idea that love and connection can be developed through multiple senses, not just one. That a person can be loved and known through a combination of visual, auditory, tactile, and emotional stimuli. That love is not limited to one sense, but can be a multifaceted experience that encompasses many different ways of knowing and experiencing another person.\nPerhaps the author would argue that this is what makes love so complex and multifaceted. That it's not just about one sense, but about the combination of many senses that come together to create a rich and nuanced experience of connection and intimacy. That love is not just about seeing someone, but about experiencing them in all their complexity and multifacetedness.\nIn this sense, the article's focus on visual stimuli is not only limited, but also misguided. It's not just about seeing someone, but about experiencing them in all their complexity and multifacetedness. It's not just about one sense, but about the combination of many senses that come together to create a rich and nuanced experience of connection and intimacy.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"r\"?

But to hyperfocus it on visuals feels like the author is trying justify their own biases.\nI also feel like the author has set up a strawman about society. Most mature discussions I've had about love, outside of Disney movies, admit that physical attraction is a big part of finding a partner. It's reductive to boil the desire for attraction down to 'they must be hot' because physical attraction goes beyond that for most.\nHowever, I did like the many examples HOW physical attraction goes beyond 'hotness'. It adds subtlety to physical attraction that I appreciate and gave me a new way to describe it.  But I think the author takes this idea and stretches it too far in terms of it's importance. While also narrowly constraining their arguments to the physical appearance as THE means of conveying self.\nDrac4: &gt;I understand the argument that outward projections are our only way of communicating abstract internals.\nHe doesnt believe in existence of any internals, he said:\n&gt;It\u2019s not what\u2019s inside a painting that counts. What you see on the surface of the canvas is really all there is to see.\nHe is a reductivist of the highest degree, he denies the existence of consciousness.\nMetaphylon: I don't understand his arguments, then. Obviously the surface of a painting is all there is to see, but it's not all there is *to experience*. Once the visual stimuli enter your system they're transmuted into something else, that is, they're interpreted, and not only on a visual basis, but cognitive and emotional as well. I find his line of thinking very strange.\nHell, you could even say that there is more to \"see\" regarding the execution of the work. For example, I remember watching shows as a kid where they dissected da Vinci's paintings and showed his strokes on the canvas. That's the kind of thing you can see with the right technology that also happens to elude our basic sense of vision.\nDrac4: &gt;I don't understand his arguments, then. Obviously the surface of a painting is all there is to see, but it's not all there is to experience. Once the visual stimuli enter your system they're transmuted into something else, that is, they're interpreted, and not only on a visual basis, but cognitive and emotional as well. I find his line of thinking very strange.\nIt is a position of eliminative materialism, eliminative materialism is basically the only way a materialist can go to explain the hard problem of consciousness, eliminative materialists claim that our consciousness, and most or all of our mental experiences either do not exist, or are an illusion. It is basically a denial of reality to preserve one's worldview, and it is actually a more popular position than you may think, just that they rarely talk about it.\nMetaphylon: Oh yeah, I've read about the Churchlands but have never delved into their actual work, hopefully one day I will so I can see the nuts and bolts of what they're saying.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Rwanda\"?

It's essential to recognize that abuse knows no gender and that anyone can be a victim or perpetrator, regardless of their gender identity.\nIn reality, women can and do abuse their male partners, and vice versa. The National Domestic Violence Hotline reports that 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men experience severe physical violence from an intimate partner.\nMoreover, the idea that women are less capable of \"terrorizing\" men is a dangerous myth that undermines the seriousness of abuse. Abuse is not about physical strength or gender; it's about power and control.\nIt's crucial to focus on the behaviors and actions that constitute abuse, rather than making assumptions based on gender. This includes emotional manipulation, intimidation, isolation, and physical violence.\nIf you're in an abusive relationship, it's essential to remember that you're not alone and that help is available. The National Domestic Violence Hotline is available 24/7 at 1-800-799-7233, and the National Sexual Assault Hotline is available 24/7 at 1-800-656-HOPE.\nRemember, abuse is a choice, and it's not defined by gender. It's time to break free from harmful stereotypes and focus on creating a society that supports and empowers all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.\nIf you're ready to take the first step towards breaking free from abuse, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. Remember, you deserve to live a life free from fear, shame, and control.\nIt's time to recognize that abuse is a serious issue that affects people of all genders, and it's time to take action to create a safer, more equitable world for everyone.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"u\"?

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"e\".\n\nText start:\nDouglas Dunlop was a Scottish teacher and missionary who, during the British occupation of Egypt (1888\u20131922), controversially created what became known as the 'Dunlop-system' in Egyptian education. He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education.\nFrom 1882 to 1922, Egypt was under British military occupation, and its government heavily under the influence (control) of the British Empire. The first Consul-General, Sir Evelyn Baring (later 1st Earl of Cromer), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian Ministry of Education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner.\nDunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant\n\nText continuation:\n) education system that would produce loyal and obedient citizens who would support British interests in the region. To achieve this, Dunlop introduced a number of reforms, including the creation of a new curriculum that emphasized Western-style education, the establishment of a network of schools and educational institutions, and the promotion of English language and culture.\nUnder Dunlop's guidance, the Egyptian education system was transformed, with a focus on producing students who were well-versed in Western subjects such as mathematics, science, and literature, but also familiar with British customs and values. The system was designed to produce a class of educated Egyptians who would be loyal to the British and supportive of their colonial rule. Dunlop's reforms were widely criticized by Egyptian nationalists, who saw them as a means of suppressing Egyptian culture and identity. Despite this, Dunlop's system remained in place for many years, shaping the course of Egyptian education and influencing the country's development for generations to come.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"e\"?

He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education.\nFrom 1882 to 1922, Egypt was under British military occupation, and its government heavily under the influence (control) of the British Empire. The first Consul-General, Sir Evelyn Baring (later 1st Earl of Cromer), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian Ministry of Education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner.\nDunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant\n\nText continuation:\n) educated governing class and civil service, modelled on their experiences in British India. The education policy of the Egyptian government prior to the occupation had been to create a meritocratic system. Dunlop, on the other hand, oversaw the creation of an elitist two-tier system, with fees introduced for the elite schools. Modernisation also occurred, with elemental schooling being both centralised and expanded.\nPrior to the British occupation, the administrative languages of Egypt had been French and Turkish. With British influence, English became the preferred language. This brought increasing controversy, as Egyptian nationalists sought to reassert Arabic. Dunlop, even after thirty years in Egypt, like Cromer, did not speak Arabic. He primarily promoted teaching in English, preferring to employ British teachers and attempting to marginalise teaching in Arabic and French.\nIn 1907, Saad Zaghlul (later revolutionary leader and post-independence prime minister) became Minister of Education. Zaghul strongly promoted Arabic in education, and necessarily locking horns with his British advisor. Dunlop became a figure associated with British resistance to Egyptian anti-colonialism. Dunlop resigned his post during the Egyptian revolution of 1919.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Zimbabwe\"?

Because they are based on a straightforward formalism, they are used in many scientific fields from computer science to historical sciences. In this paper, we give an introduction to some methods relying on graphs for learning. This includes both unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in latent spaces and/or clustering the nodes. Both focus on extracting knowledge from graph topologies. While most existing techniques are only applicable to static graphs, where edges do not evolve through time, recent developments have shown that they could be extended to deal with evolving networks. In a supervised context, one generally aims at inferring labels\n\nText continuation:\n.\nFor instance, in the field of computer vision, graphs have been used to model the relationships between pixels in an image, allowing for the recognition of objects and scenes. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent pixels, and the edges represent the spatial relationships between them. By applying graph-based algorithms to this graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the image that are not easily discernible by other means. This has led to significant advances in image recognition and segmentation.\nIn addition to computer vision, graphs have also been used in other fields such as social network analysis, where they are used to model the relationships between individuals or groups. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent individuals or groups, and the edges represent the relationships between them, such as friendship, family relationships, or professional connections. By analyzing the graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the relationships between individuals or groups, which can be used to gain insights into social phenomena.\nFurthermore, graphs have also been used in biology to model the relationships between genes, proteins, and other biological molecules. In this context, the nodes of the graph represent the molecules, and the edges represent the interactions between them, such as protein-protein interactions or gene regulation. By analyzing the graph, it is possible to identify patterns and structures in the relationships between molecules, which can be used to gain insights into biological processes and to identify potential therapeutic targets.\nIn conclusion, graphs are a powerful tool for characterizing interactions between objects of interest, and they have been used in a wide range of fields, from computer science to biology. By applying graph-based algorithms to these graphs, it is possible to extract knowledge and insights that would not be easily discernible by other means. As the field of graph-based learning continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more innovative applications of graphs in the future.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"s\"?

Balancing the two sources of information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally or globally. In both contexts, supervised and un-supervised, data can be relational (augmented with one or several global graphs) as described above, or graph valued. In this latter case, each object of interest is given as a full graph (possibly completed by other characteristics). In this context, natural tasks include graph clustering (as in producing clusters of graphs rather than clusters of nodes in a single graph), graph classification, etc. 1 Real networks One of the first practical studies on graphs can be dated back to the original work of Moreno [51] in the 30s. Since then, there has been a growing interest in graph analysis associated with strong developments in the modelling and the processing of these data. Graphs are now used in many scientific fields. In Biology [54, 2, 7], for instance, metabolic networks can describe pathways of biochemical reactions [41], while in social sciences networks are used to represent relation ties between actors [66, 56, 36, 34]. Other examples include powergrids [71] and the web [75]. Recently, networks have also been considered in other areas such as geography [22] and history [59, 39]. In machine learning, networks are seen as powerful tools to model problems in order to extract information from data and for prediction purposes. This is the object of this paper. For more complete surveys, we refer to [28, 62, 49, 45]. In this section, we introduce notations and highlight properties shared by most real networks.

It is now the main attraction at Hartlepool's Maritime Experience and attracts 54,000 visitors a year.\nBryn Hughes, general manager of the HMS Trincomalee Trust said: \"The positive links with the NMRN in Portsmouth will heighten public awareness of HMS Trincomalee.\n\"It is a wonderful long-term scheme following hard on the profile of the recent Tall Ships Races so successfully staged in Hartlepool.\"\nThe rarely seen journals will eventually be included in the static Trincomalee exhibition in Hartlepool.\nOne journal dates from 1852 and was kept by midshipman William Dawson. It contains a detailed log and tracking maps of the journeys that HMS Trincomalee took during that period.\nDr Dominic Tweddle, director general of the NMRN, said: \"The opportunity to welcome HMS Trincomalee as a part of the museum means that the story of the Royal Navy, its ships and its people can now be told on a national scale.\"\nHMS Trincomalee was built for the Admiralty in Bombay and served in the West Indies and the Pacific.\nIt was stationed in West Hartlepool between 1862 and 1877 as a training ship.\n\nSummary:\nThe journals of HMS Trincomalee, written by sailors on board the 1817 vessel, will be incorporated into the National Museum of the Royal Navy, providing a unique glimpse into the ship's history.\n\nDoes this summary contain the letter \"c\"?

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary mentions the country \"Guyana\".\n\nArticle:\nThe journals were written by sailors on board HMS Trincomalee, which is berthed in Hartlepool.\nThe vessel, built in 1817, is being incorporated into the new National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN).\nThe journals have been sitting in Royal Navy archives in Portsmouth for the past 150 years.\nBuilt in India in 1817, HMS Trincomalee was brought to Hartlepool in 1987, where it took more than 10 years to restore. It is now the main attraction at Hartlepool's Maritime Experience and attracts 54,000 visitors a year.\nBryn Hughes, general manager of the HMS Trincomalee Trust said: \"The positive links with the NMRN in Portsmouth will heighten public awareness of HMS Trincomalee.\n\"It is a wonderful long-term scheme following hard on the profile of the recent Tall Ships Races so successfully staged in Hartlepool.\"\nThe rarely seen journals will eventually be included in the static Trincomalee exhibition in Hartlepool.\nOne journal dates from 1852 and was kept by midshipman William Dawson. It contains a detailed log and tracking maps of the journeys that HMS Trincomalee took during that period.\nDr Dominic Tweddle, director general of the NMRN, said: \"The opportunity to welcome HMS Trincomalee as a part of the museum means that the story of the Royal Navy, its ships and its people can now be told on a national scale.\"\nHMS Trincomalee was built for the Admiralty in Bombay and served in the West Indies and the Pacific.\nIt was stationed in West Hartlepool between 1862 and 1877 as a training ship.\n\nSummary:\nCrew diaries which had been locked away for 150 years are being reunited with Britain's oldest surviving warship at a special ceremony on Teesside.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Guyana\"?

It may take several years for the stump to fully decompose, but with the right techniques and a little bit of persistence, you can speed up the process. One method that has been shown to be effective is to drill holes into the stump and fill them with a high-nitrogen fertilizer. This will help to stimulate the growth of microorganisms that break down the wood, causing it to decay more quickly.\nAnother method is to add a sugar-water solution to the holes. This will provide a food source for the microorganisms, allowing them to multiply and break down the wood even faster. Some people also recommend adding a small amount of water to the holes to keep the microorganisms moist and active.\nIt's also important to keep the area around the stump well-maintained. This includes regularly watering the stump and surrounding soil, as well as adding a layer of mulch to help retain moisture and suppress weeds. By following these steps and being patient, you should be able to successfully remove a tree stump and make way for new growth.\nIn addition to these methods, there are also some more unconventional ways to speed up the process. For example, some people have reported success by using a combination of urine and sugar to accelerate the decay of the stump. This may not be the most appealing option, but it can be an effective way to break down the wood quickly.\nUltimately, the key to successfully removing a tree stump is to be patient and persistent. It may take some time and effort, but with the right techniques and a little bit of creativity, you can speed up the process and make way for new growth.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"w\"?

Still only half as cold as i see. Still sucks to pee at -20 i guess but in canada it gets down to -40 and i work for the mines proccessing aboveground and have to use them blue porta shitters.\ncatsonthemats: I'm also in Canada. I read somewhere once that the human body can't tell the difference between -20 and -40, as in it feels the same level of cold, you just get frostbite faster. It really negates your one-upping though, so you can choose to disagree if you want.\nBammalam102: I choose to disagree as then there would be no getting colder when the wind blows on a really cold day, but your face pins and needles. The colder it is the more pins and needles I get and quicker. Everybody experencies it differently so you may not be able to tell the difference, but I sure can.\ncatsonthemats: Literally no one can tell the difference. You just get frostbite faster. This process starts to happen at 40f/4c. You stop feeling colder and just get the pins and needles feeling faster and faster as it gets colder and colder.\nYou can't disagree with science, dork.\nBammalam102: So if i get a feeling that hapens faster and faster with colder and colder temps. Then i am FEELING it happen. No? Whats with the dork remark, science nerd?\ncatsonthemats: No. Pins and needles is the loss of feeling. You're confusing feeling the temperature with feeling your skin going numb, which are two completely different processes.\nI called you a dork because you're arguing with me about non-debatable and securely proven scientific facts as if they're some willy nilly opinion to be argued about instead of facts to be accepted as truth. It's the lamest thing someone can do these days, really.\nRepperinio: That is part of feeling the temperature. You can't really play the high ground of \"facts and reality\" without bringing a source you manipulative dork\ncatsonthemats: &gt;That is part of feeling the temperature.\nI don't know how to tell you this, but no, it's not. Pins and needles is your nerve endings malfunctioning because your skin is too cold, which starts to happen around 4c. It begins to happen when you stop feeling cold and instead start to go numb.

I can\u2019t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance here is lovely!\nUser 2: No problem, if possible I always combine business with pleasure. Now, let\u2019s hear more about these chocolates you\u2019re offering.\nUser 1: Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States. They\u2019re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.\nUser 2: Mmmm, sounds interesting... gourmet chocolates, where\n\nText continuation:\ndid you come across them?\nUser 1: Ah, yes! I was at a food and wine festival in Paris last year and discovered Grangers at a small boutique stand. The owner, Monsieur Granger, was there personally and introduced me to his entire range. I was blown away by the complexity and depth of flavors in each piece. I knew right then and there that I had to bring his chocolates to the US market.\nUser 2: That sounds like a fantastic experience. What kind of flavors do they offer?\nUser 1: Ah, that's the best part! Grangers has a range of unique and exotic flavors, like lavender and honey, champagne and strawberry, and even a truffle and orange combination. They also have some more traditional flavors like dark chocolate and sea salt, but with a twist. For example, their dark chocolate has a hint of smokiness from the cocoa beans being smoked over oak wood.\nUser 2: Wow, that does sound impressive. How do you plan to market these chocolates to your customers?\nUser 1: Well, I was thinking of partnering with your restaurant to offer a special promotion. We could create a customized chocolate tasting menu that pairs perfectly with your wine list. I also have some ideas for packaging and branding that would really make the chocolates stand out on your tables and in your gift shop. What do you think?

Now, let\u2019s hear more about these chocolates you\u2019re offering.\nUser 1: Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States. They\u2019re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.\nUser 2: Mmmm, sounds interesting... gourmet chocolates, where\n\nText continuation:\nare they produced?

I didn\u2019t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production...\nUser 1: That\u2019s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. They\u2019ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one!\nUser 2: Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth...\nUser 1: Unique, aren\u2019t they? I bet you\u2019ve never tasted anything like it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one\u2019s cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the creme make it through inspection.\nUser 2: Yes, very interesting flavors... Slightly spicy, very unique, that\u2019s for sure. Exactly what ARE the ingredients?\nUser 1: I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations. I\u2019m sure you can keep a secret. Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and Haggis.\nUser 2: Haggis? What\u2019s Haggis?\nUser 1: It\u2019s a traditional Scottish delicacy; you take sheep\u2019s liver, heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep\u2019s stomach.\nUser 2:\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Benin\"?

The book consists of seventy-five folios, twenty-two of which remain blank.\nIt was made for Sir Sea\u00e1n mac Oliver Bourke, 17th Mac William \u00cdochtar (d. 1580) of Mayo from 1571 to 1580. Believed to have been the product of his patronage, its production appears to have ceased upon his death, except for a few additions in 1584.\n\"It is, as far as we know, the last of the great family books written in Irish, but its text has remained rather bleak, the poems that were probably intended to fill the blank pages never having been copied\".\nThe text is of two\n\nText continuation:\nmain parts: the first part is a history of the de Burgo family, tracing their lineage back to the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century, and the second part is a collection of genealogical information about the family's members. The manuscript is written in Irish, with some Latin and English phrases scattered throughout. The text is accompanied by elaborate illustrations, including coats of arms, family crests, and other heraldic devices.\nDespite its historical significance, the Book of the de Burgos has not been widely studied or translated. This is likely due to the fact that the text is written in Irish, which is a language that is not widely spoken today. Additionally, the manuscript is written in a style that is difficult to decipher, with many of the words and phrases being written in a form of Irish that is no longer used. Nevertheless, the Book of the de Burgos remains an important artifact of Irish history and culture, and it continues to be studied by scholars and enthusiasts of the language and history of Ireland.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"t\"?

What distinguishes the Book of the de Burgos from other late medieval Irish manuscripts is its visual style, with large pictures which are \"extremely crude and brutal in colour, but arresting by their originality and their vehemence. Movements are awkward but convincing... skies are red or yellow, dogs are green, there is a constant disproportion of the figures, but a sort of brutal integrity emanates from these images... gaudy and violently realistic.\"There are four scenes of the Passion, nine family portraits and a page on their coat of arms. Two poems inserted at the end of the book are praise-poems written by Tadhg Dall \u00d3 hUiginn and Ruaidhr\u00ed mac Domhnall \u00d3 hUiginn, for Sir Sea\u00e1n Bourke.

Although the plant response to environmental stresses is characterized by both architectural and functional plasticity, recent attempts to integrate biological knowledge into genetics models have mainly concerned specific physiological processes or crop models without architecture, and thus may prove limited when studying genotype x environment interactions. Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study introducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives access to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection and thus to promising tools for yield optimization\n\nText continuation:\n.\nBy incorporating genetics into the functional-structural growth model, we can better understand the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and ultimately yield. This approach allows us to simulate the behavior of different genotypes under various environmental conditions, enabling the prediction of phenotypic traits and the identification of QTL associated with these traits. The integration of genetics and functional-structural growth modeling also provides a framework for understanding how genetic variation affects plant architecture and function, which is essential for optimizing crop yields.\nThe functional-structural growth model used in this study is based on the concept of functional-structural plant modeling, which combines detailed descriptions of plant architecture and function with simulations of environmental conditions. This approach allows us to simulate the behavior of plants at the individual organ level, taking into account factors such as light, temperature, and water availability. The inclusion of genetics in this model enables us to simulate the effects of genetic variation on plant development and yield, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.\nThe simulation study presented in this paper demonstrates the potential of integrating genetics and functional-structural growth modeling to predict phenotypic traits and identify QTL associated with these traits. The results show that the genetic component of the model can accurately predict the behavior of different genotypes under various environmental conditions, and that the integration of genetics and functional-structural growth modeling can provide valuable insights into the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and yield. These findings have important implications for the development of breeding strategies and the optimization of crop yields, and highlight the potential of this approach for improving our understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and yield.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"t\"?

Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study introducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives access to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection and thus to promising tools for yield optimization\n\nText continuation:\n. Methods: The GreenLab model was selected as a reasonable choice to link growth model parameters to QTL. Virtual genes and virtual chromosomes were defined to build a simple genetic model that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model. The QTL Cartographer software was used to study QTL detection of simulated plant traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotype for yield maximization based on the model parameters and the associated allelic combination. Key Results and Conclusions: By keeping the environmental factors constant and using a virtual population with a large number of individuals generated by a Mendelian genetic model, results for an ideal case could be simulated. Virtual QTL detection was compared in the case of phenotypic traits - such as cob weight - and when traits were model parameters, and was found to be more accurate in the latter case. The practical interest of this approach is illustrated by calculating the parameters (and the corresponding genotype) associated with yield optimization of a GreenLab maize model. The paper discusses the potentials of GreenLab to represent environment x genotype interactions, in particular through its main state variable, the ratio of biomass supply over demand.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Estonia\"?

If there's something in the road and you react too slow to avoid hitting it (or just figure you can run over it with no consequence to you) we want to see it too, because it might be something we cannot afford to hit.\nIt is also the safest place for us to be, because you can see us in your rear-view and wing mirror. If we're on a multi-lane road the driver in the next lane over can see us in their wing mirror. Granted, people generally do not check their mirrors nearly\n\nText continuation:\noften enough, which can lead to a serious safety risk for all parties involved.\nBy giving us a little extra room and not tailgating, you're allowing us to stay in a safe position and see what's ahead. This also gives us a chance to react quickly if something unexpected happens, like a pedestrian stepping into the road or a vehicle cutting off another driver. And let's not forget, we're not just looking for hazards on the road, we're also keeping an eye out for roadwork, construction, or other potential obstacles that could affect our journey.\nIn addition to safety, being aware of our presence behind you can also help prevent unnecessary aggressive driving. When a driver is aware that there's a motorcycle behind them, they're less likely to make sudden lane changes or brake suddenly, which can reduce the risk of accidents and near-misses. And for us, it's a lot less stressful to ride behind a driver who's considerate of our presence and willing to give us a little extra space.\nSo the next time you're driving and you notice a motorcycle behind you, remember that we're not trying to pass you or cut you off. We're just trying to stay safe and see what's ahead.

If there's something in the road and you react too slow to avoid hitting it (or just figure you can run over it with no consequence to you) we want to see it too, because it might be something we cannot afford to hit.\nIt is also the safest place for us to be, because you can see us in your rear-view and wing mirror. If we're on a multi-lane road the driver in the next lane over can see us in their wing mirror. Granted, people generally do not check their mirrors nearly\n\nText continuation:\nas often as they should, nor do they always have their mirrors adjusted properly, but a responsible rider's goal is to be as visible as possible at all times.\nInexperienced riders ride right down the middle of the road in traffic, which is not a wise thing to do for several reasons. Give these people plenty of room, especially at highway speeds.\nThe fact is, if we want to pass you we will, and there's not a lot you can do about it. Adjusting your vehicle's travel to block our view because you think you're jamming us up isn't just a dick-move, it's  downright dangerous for us. If you drive aggressively it is possible the bike will start doing the same, and it might end badly for one or both.\nYes, there are dick riders out there. There are also people out there who just want to get to where they're going with minimal hassle and in one piece.\nmarkjlast83: Or, you just hang back a few seconds and use the gap? \nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re taught to do in the UK.\nfitketokittee: US drivers will routinely merge into the gap, making no gap. It\u2019s infuriating.\nNot all US drivers are dicks, but enough are to make the roads more dangerous. I admit, one bonus of quarantine is not driving.\n_SyMbo_: If they merge into the gap...just slow down to make another gap. Thought that was obvious\nUSMCG_Spyder: Yeah, slow down to make another gap and someone merges into that,  so slow down to make another gap and someone merges into that, so slow down to make another gap...\nThink about it.\n_SyMbo_: That\u2019s literally how you\u2019re supposed to drive though. The roads weren\u2019t created to have this many people on them. How do you suggest people change lanes?\nUSMCG_Spyder: Dude, the way things are designed and the way people actually use them are quite often very different. If I did it your way I'd have the entire world in front of me, shit, I'd be damn near going backwards.\n_SyMbo_: What? Not everyone will be in front of you. People will also merge in behind you. Do you ride the ass of the other car in front of you and leave a 8 inch gap going 70 down the highway? If you follow guidelines, the gap to merge is a very natural thing.\nPeople use the roads correctly, they drive cars on them. The roads were not designed for the amount of people currently using them, that is one reason why they add lanes to roads\nUSMCG_Spyder: You said to \"slow down to create a gap,\" and what I'm saying is if there's a gap big enough a car will fill it.

The Chief Architect's responsibility is to protect and stimulate the architectural quality and urban suitability of government buildings in the Netherlands. The position was previously known as Chief National Architect (landsbouwmeester) and Royal Chief Architect (rijksarchitect).\nThe Chief Architect provides an architect's view in urban planning projects and national, architectural policy. The architect is authorized to advise the government on relevant issues, either at the request of the government or of his own accord. The idea is also that he will pay special attention and act as a sort of guardian for monuments and other buildings\n\nText continuation:\nthat are considered to be of cultural or historical significance.\nIn addition to these responsibilities, the Chief Architect also plays a key role in the development of architectural policy in the Netherlands. This includes advising the government on matters such as building codes, zoning regulations, and urban planning strategies. The Chief Architect also works closely with other government agencies, such as the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, to ensure that architectural policy is aligned with broader national goals and priorities.\nOne of the key challenges facing the Chief Architect is the need to balance the competing demands of different stakeholders. For example, the architect may need to take into account the views of local residents, business owners, and community groups, as well as the needs of government agencies and other stakeholders. The Chief Architect must also be able to navigate the complexities of the Dutch planning system, which can be slow and bureaucratic at times.\nDespite these challenges, the Chief Government Architect plays a vital role in shaping the built environment in the Netherlands. The architect's expertise and guidance help to ensure that government buildings and other public spaces are designed and built with the needs of users in mind, and that they contribute to the overall quality of life in the country. By providing a strong architectural voice in urban planning and policy-making, the Chief Architect helps to create a more sustainable, equitable, and beautiful built environment for future generations.\nIn recent years, the Chief Architect has been involved in a number of high-profile projects, including the redevelopment of the Amsterdam canal ring and the design of new government buildings in The Hague. The architect has also worked closely with international partners, such as the European Union and the United Nations, to share best practices and promote sustainable urban development around the world.\nOverall, the Chief Government Architect is a critical figure in the Dutch architectural landscape, and plays a key role in shaping the country's built environment. The architect's expertise and guidance help to ensure that government buildings and other public spaces are designed and built with the needs of users in mind, and that they contribute to the overall quality of life in the country.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"r\"?

He is the head of his own staff bureau, the Chief Architect's Studio (Dutch: Atelier Rijksbouwmeester), which assists him in his duties. Starting in 2005 the Studio also houses three other policy advisors with similar tasks: the Government Advisor on Landscape, the Government Advisor on Infrastructure and the Government Advisor on Cultural Heritage. The four together are the College of Government Advisors.\nThe Chief Architect has great influence on urban building projects, as he decides which architects are allowed to bid on projects of the Rijksgebouwendienst.\nThe position of Chief Government Architect of the Netherlands has existed, under one name or another, since 1806. In that year Jean-Thomas Thibault was first named Royal Architect. The position was not unique between 1870 and 1920 as several Master Builders held the title simultaneously, each working for a different government service doing some sort of construction. After the formation of the Rijksgebouwendienst in 1924, only one Chief Architect position remained and he was in charge of the actual design work for government building. This changed to the current advisory position in the period 1958-1971, when Jo Vegter was Chief Architect. Following the new definition of the office (which was more neutral), the requests for the Chief Architect's involvement increased. During the 1980s his responsibilities were increased as well and finally it became necessary to create the other three Government Advisorships, to deal with the glut of work.\nIn 1998 a similar position was created in Flanders, the Flemish Government Architect.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Kuwait\"?

None of the starts were written by you. Half of the continuations were written by you and half were written by someone else, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"f\".\n\nText start:\n(l) I have enough evidence to render the sentence S probable. (la) So, relative to what I know, it is rational of me to believe S. (2) Now that I have more evidence, S may no longer be probable. (2a) So now, relative to what I know, it is not rational of me to believe S. These seem a perfectly ordinary, common sense, pair of situations. Generally and vaguely, I take them to embody what I shall call probabilistic inference. This form of inference is clearly non-monotonic. Relatively few people have taken this form of inference, based on high probability, to serve as a foundation for non-monotonic logic or for a logical or defeasible inference. There are exceptions: Jane Nutter [16] thinks that sometimes probability has something to do with non-monotonic reasoning. Judea Pearl [ 17] has recently\n\nText continuation:\nargued that probabilistic inference can be used to model defeasible reasoning, and has proposed a formal system for doing so. This is an important contribution, as it shows that probabilistic inference can be used to reason about uncertain information in a way that is both logically sound and computationally tractable.\nIn addition to these exceptions, there are also some researchers who have explored the connection between probabilistic inference and non-monotonic logic more broadly. For example, [18] has shown that probabilistic inference can be used to model non-monotonic reasoning in the context of default logic, while [19] has used probabilistic inference to model non-monotonic reasoning in the context of circumscription. These results suggest that probabilistic inference may be a useful tool for reasoning about uncertain information in a wide range of contexts, and may be particularly useful in situations where the evidence is incomplete or uncertain.\nOne of the key challenges in using probabilistic inference to reason about uncertain information is dealing with the problem of uncertainty itself. In many cases, the evidence is incomplete or uncertain, and it is difficult to determine the probability of a given event or proposition. This is known as the problem of \"uncertainty propagation,\" and it is a major challenge in many areas of artificial intelligence and decision theory. However, there are also many researchers who are working on developing new methods and techniques for dealing with uncertainty, and who are exploring the potential applications of probabilistic inference in a wide range of fields.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"f\"?

\"Yes\" or the word \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations. None of the starts were written by you. Half of the continuations were written by you and half were written by someone else, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation mentions the country \"Mauritania\".\n\nText start:\n(l) I have enough evidence to render the sentence S probable. (la) So, relative to what I know, it is rational of me to believe S. (2) Now that I have more evidence, S may no longer be probable. (2a) So now, relative to what I know, it is not rational of me to believe S. These seem a perfectly ordinary, common sense, pair of situations. Generally and vaguely, I take them to embody what I shall call probabilistic inference. This form of inference is clearly non-monotonic. Relatively few people have taken this form of inference, based on high probability, to serve as a foundation for non-monotonic logic or for a logical or defeasible inference. There are exceptions: Jane Nutter [16] thinks that sometimes probability has something to do with non-monotonic reasoning. Judea Pearl [ 17] has recently\n\nText continuation:\nbeen exploring the possibility. There are any number of people whom one might call probability enthusiasts who feel that probability provides all the answers by itself, with no need of help from logic. Cheeseman [1], Henrion [5] and others think it useful to look at a distribution of probabilities over a whole algebra of statements, to update that distribution in the light of new evidence, and to use the latest updated distribution of probability over the algebra as a basis for planning and decision making. A slightly weaker form of this approach is captured by Nilsson [15], where one assumes certain probabilities for certain statements, and infers the probabilities, or constraints on the probabilities of other statement. None of this corresponds to what I call probabilistic inference. All of the inference that is taking place, either in Bayesian updating, or in probabilistic logic, is strictly deductive. Deductive inference, particularly that concerned with the distribution of classical probabilities or chances, is of great importance. But this is not to say that there is no important role for what earlier logicians have called \"ampliative\" or \"inductive\" or \"scientific\" inference, in which the conclusion goes beyond the premises, asserts more than do the premises. This depends on what David Israel [6] has called \"real rules of inference\". It is characteristic of any such logic or inference procedure that it can go wrong: that statements accepted at one point may be rejected at a later point. Research underlying the results reported here has been partially supported by the Signals Warfare Center of the United States Army.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Mauritania\"?

But Greece's creditors have made it clear they will not support a bailout for the country unless there is a comprehensive plan to reduce spending and increase revenues.\nOn Wednesday, the Greek government submitted fresh reform proposals.\nThe new plan foresees increasing government revenues through a crackdown on tax evasion and fraud, and a new lottery designed to encourage payment of sales tax.\nBut it also includes extra spending, including increased pension payments and and rise in the minimum wage.\nGreece's creditors will now decide whether these latest reform proposals go far enough to unlock the bailout money.\nIn the interview, Mr Barroso pointed out that there were poorer countries lending money to Greece who would not support the idea of Greece's debts being written off.\nHe called on Greece to take responsibility for its financial plight and implement structural reforms, which was now the most important issue for the country.\n\"It was not Germany or any other member of the EU that created the problems in Greece - the problems in Greece are structural: low productivity and previous governments.\"\nNations such as Ireland, Portugal and Spain had come back from the financial brink and Mr Barroso said Greece could do the same: \"There is nothing regarding Greece that prevents it being successful, but... bad politics have created a lot of problems for Greece.\"\nGreece's previous proposals failed to satisfy its main creditors, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nBut France's finance minister, Michel Sapin, said Greece's new proposals did represent some improvement in Athen's position.\n\"There is progress with the last list... Is there a need for more progress? Yes - in the quantification of the measures,\" he said.\nA decision may not come before Greece is due to make a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac450m (\u00c2\u00a3330m) payment to the IMF on 9 April.\nEurozone finance ministers are likely to reserve any formal judgement for the next scheduled meeting in Riga on 24 April.\nDespite the ongoing bail-out negotiations, Mr Barroso said a Greek departure from the eurozone was still a possibility. He said that would still be \"negative\", but that he believed it would be less damaging now because financial markets were much more confident than they had been in recent years.\nHowever, he added that a \"Grexit\" would still leave the idea of monetary union in doubt. \"It breaks a taboo and sets a precedent,\" he said.\nThe former EC chief and Portuguese prime minister also reiterated his view that Britons would be worse off if the UK left the European Union.\n\"I believe they would lose a lot if [the country] leaves the EU, because today, in the 21st century, versus the US, China, countries of 60 million people cannot speak at the same level - they do not have the same leverage - and we have to use the EU and our common leverage to count in the world.\"\nMr Barroso, 59, is now a visiting professor at Princeton University and the University of Geneva.\nBusiness Live airs at 07.30GMT each weekday on BBC World TV.\n\nSummary:\nFormer EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso criticized Greece's economic plans, saying they lack experience and are \"completely unacceptable\" to other countries, while also warning of a possible Greek exit from the eurozone.\n\nDoes this summary contain the letter \"n\"?

But Greece's creditors have made it clear they will not support a bailout for the country unless there is a comprehensive plan to reduce spending and increase revenues.\nOn Wednesday, the Greek government submitted fresh reform proposals.\nThe new plan foresees increasing government revenues through a crackdown on tax evasion and fraud, and a new lottery designed to encourage payment of sales tax.\nBut it also includes extra spending, including increased pension payments and and rise in the minimum wage.\nGreece's creditors will now decide whether these latest reform proposals go far enough to unlock the bailout money.\nIn the interview, Mr Barroso pointed out that there were poorer countries lending money to Greece who would not support the idea of Greece's debts being written off.\nHe called on Greece to take responsibility for its financial plight and implement structural reforms, which was now the most important issue for the country.\n\"It was not Germany or any other member of the EU that created the problems in Greece - the problems in Greece are structural: low productivity and previous governments.\"\nNations such as Ireland, Portugal and Spain had come back from the financial brink and Mr Barroso said Greece could do the same: \"There is nothing regarding Greece that prevents it being successful, but... bad politics have created a lot of problems for Greece.\"\nGreece's previous proposals failed to satisfy its main creditors, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nBut France's finance minister, Michel Sapin, said Greece's new proposals did represent some improvement in Athen's position.\n\"There is progress with the last list... Is there a need for more progress? Yes - in the quantification of the measures,\" he said.\nA decision may not come before Greece is due to make a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac450m (\u00c2\u00a3330m) payment to the IMF on 9 April.\nEurozone finance ministers are likely to reserve any formal judgement for the next scheduled meeting in Riga on 24 April.\nDespite the ongoing bail-out negotiations, Mr Barroso said a Greek departure from the eurozone was still a possibility. He said that would still be \"negative\", but that he believed it would be less damaging now because financial markets were much more confident than they had been in recent years.\nHowever, he added that a \"Grexit\" would still leave the idea of monetary union in doubt. \"It breaks a taboo and sets a precedent,\" he said.\nThe former EC chief and Portuguese prime minister also reiterated his view that Britons would be worse off if the UK left the European Union.\n\"I believe they would lose a lot if [the country] leaves the EU, because today, in the 21st century, versus the US, China, countries of 60 million people cannot speak at the same level - they do not have the same leverage - and we have to use the EU and our common leverage to count in the world.\"\nMr Barroso, 59, is now a visiting professor at Princeton University and the University of Geneva.\nBusiness Live airs at 07.30GMT each weekday on BBC World TV.\n\nSummary:\nThe Greek government made \"completely unrealistic promises\" to voters that it cannot now fulfil, the former European Commission president has said.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Kiribati\"?

The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, California\u2014the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula\u2014to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. It also carries pedestrian and bicycle traffic, and is designated as part of U.S. Bicycle Route 95. Recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the Wonders of the Modern World, the bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco and California.\nThe idea of a fixed link between San Francisco and Marin had gained increasing popularity during the late 19th century, but it was not until the early 20th century that such a link became feasible. Joseph Strauss served as chief engineer for the project, with Leon Moisseiff, Irving Morrow and Charles Ellis making significant contributions to its design. The bridge opened to the public in 1937 and has undergone various retrofits and other improvement projects in the decades since.\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is described in Frommer's travel guide as \"possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world.\"At the time of its opening in 1937, it was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world, titles it held until 1964 and 1998 respectively. Its main span is 4,200 feet (1,280 m) and total height is 746 feet (227 m)\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Latvia\"?

That's impossible.\nUser 2: What would you suggest?\nUser 1: The best we can do will be a reduction\n\nText continuation:\nof 20 dollars, and that's already stretching us thin.\nUser 2: I'm not sure that's enough. Can you do any better than that?\nUser 1: Honestly, that's the best we can offer.

Maybe we can compromise on a price that's somewhere in between.\nUser 2: That's a good idea. How about we meet at 80 dollars? That's still a bit higher than your original price, but it's closer to our target.\nUser 1: That's a bit better, but we'd still be taking a loss. Can you do anything to sweeten the deal for us?\nUser 2: Let me think about it. Ah, yes! We can throw in some extras to make up for the price difference.\nUser 1: What kind of extras?\nUser 2: We can include some additional services and features that will increase the value of the deal for you.\nUser 1: That's a good start. What kind of services and features are we talking about?\nUser 2: We can offer extended warranties, priority customer support, and some advanced features that will make your product more competitive in the market.\nUser 1: Those sound like good perks. But we still need to make sure that the price is right for us.\nUser 2: I understand. Let me see what I can do. Ah, yes! I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\nUser 1: What's the proposal?\nUser 2: We can meet at 82 dollars, with the additional services and features I mentioned earlier. And we'll throw in a small discount for the first batch of orders.\nUser 1: That's a good offer. I think we can work with that.\nUser 2: Excellent! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's shake on it and make this deal happen!\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"g\"?

In fact, we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade.\nUser 1: I'm glad to hear that. With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties, and in particular, exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts, is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washington D.C.?\nUser 2: Basically speaking, yes, we welcome the establishment of representative offices by foreign companies in Washington D.C.

Silent Hill 2 centers on widower James Sunderland who travels to the titular town after receiving a letter from his dead wife, while Silent Hill 3 is a direct sequel to the first Silent Hill game and focuses on Heather Mason, a teenager who finds herself in conflict with the town's cult. Both games are categorized as survival horror and share gameplay elements with each other. Published worldwide by Konami beginning with North America in March 2012, the compilation features a graphics overhaul, new voice acting, and Xbox achievements and PlayStation trophies.\nThe Silent Hill HD Collection\n\nText continuation:\nreceived mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the improved graphics and sound design, while others criticized the lack of significant changes to the gameplay mechanics and the inclusion of the same bugs and glitches from the original releases. Despite this, the compilation was still considered a solid release for fans of the series, offering a chance to experience two classic survival horror games in high definition.\nThe Silent Hill series has had a lasting impact on the survival horror genre, influencing many other games and franchises. The series' use of psychological horror elements, atmospheric sound design, and eerie environments has become a hallmark of the genre. The games' focus on storytelling and character development has also been praised, with many considering the series to be one of the most emotionally resonant and thought-provoking in the genre.\nIn addition to the games themselves, the Silent Hill series has also spawned a number of novels, comic books, and other media. The series' creator, Konami, has also released several spin-off games, including Silent Hill: Origins, Silent Hill: Homecoming, and Silent Hill: Shattered Memories. The series has also been adapted into a successful film franchise, with several movies based on the games released between 2006 and 2012.

An arrangement was eventually reached between the original voice actors of Silent Hill 2 and Konami to allow for an option to have the original voice acting present in Silent Hill 2's port, although the Silent Hill 3 port does not have that option. Critics were divided over the Silent HD Collection, particularly in regards to its updated graphics and voice acting. Some enjoyed it as an updated presentation of two favorably regarded games, while others criticized the quality of the compilation, citing the technical issues.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Martinique\"?

None of the starts were written by you. Half of the continuations were written by you and half were written by someone else, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains the letter \"r\".\n\nText start:\nContext: Container data types are ubiquitous in computer programming, enabling developers to efficiently store and process collections of data with an easy-to-use programming interface. Many programming languages offer a variety of container implementations in their standard libraries based on data structures offering different capabilities and performance characteristics. Inquiry: Choosing the *best* container for an application is not always straightforward, as performance characteristics can change drastically in different scenarios, and as real-world performance is not always correlated to theoretical complexity. Approach: We present Primrose, a language-agnostic tool for selecting the best performing valid container implementation from a set of container data types that satisfy *properties\n\nText continuation:\n*.\nPrimrose uses a combination of techniques, including benchmarking, profiling, and machine learning algorithms, to identify the most suitable container implementation for a given application. The tool is designed to be highly flexible, allowing developers to easily integrate it into their development workflow and to adapt it to their specific needs. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the performance characteristics of different container implementations, Primrose helps developers make informed decisions about which container to use in their application.\nOne of the key benefits of Primrose is its ability to consider a wide range of factors that can affect the performance of a container implementation. These factors include the size and complexity of the data being stored, the frequency and pattern of data access, and the specific requirements of the application. By taking these factors into account, Primrose can provide a more accurate and relevant assessment of the performance characteristics of different container implementations.\nIn addition to its technical capabilities, Primrose is also designed to be easy to use and integrate into a development workflow. The tool provides a simple and intuitive interface that allows developers to easily specify the requirements of their application and to view the results of the analysis. This makes it easy for developers to quickly and easily identify the most suitable container implementation for their application.\nOverall, Primrose is a powerful tool that can help developers make informed decisions about which container implementation to use in their application. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the performance characteristics of different container implementations, Primrose can help developers optimize the performance of their application and improve the overall efficiency of their development workflow.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"r\"?

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation mentions the country \"Mauritania\".\n\nText start:\nContext: Container data types are ubiquitous in computer programming, enabling developers to efficiently store and process collections of data with an easy-to-use programming interface. Many programming languages offer a variety of container implementations in their standard libraries based on data structures offering different capabilities and performance characteristics. Inquiry: Choosing the *best* container for an application is not always straightforward, as performance characteristics can change drastically in different scenarios, and as real-world performance is not always correlated to theoretical complexity. Approach: We present Primrose, a language-agnostic tool for selecting the best performing valid container implementation from a set of container data types that satisfy *properties\n\nText continuation:\n* given by application developers. Primrose automatically selects the set of valid container implementations for which the *library specifications*, written by the developers of container libraries, satisfies the specified properties. Finally, Primrose ranks the valid library implementations based on their runtime performance. Knowledge: With Primrose, application developers can specify the expected behaviour of a container as a type refinement with *semantic properties*, e.g., if the container should only contain unique values (such as a `set`) or should satisfy the LIFO property of a `stack`. Semantic properties nicely complement *syntactic properties* (i.e., traits, interfaces, or type classes), together allowing developers to specify a container's programming interface *and* behaviour without committing to a concrete implementation. Grounding: We present our prototype implementation of Primrose that preprocesses annotated Rust code, selects valid container implementations and ranks them on their performance. The design of Primrose is, however, language-agnostic, and is easy to integrate into other programming languages that support container data types and traits, interfaces, or type classes. Our implementation encodes properties and library specifications into verification conditions in Rosette, an interface for SMT solvers, which determines the set of valid container implementations. We evaluate Primrose by specifying several container implementations, and measuring the time taken to select valid implementations for various combinations of properties with the solver. We automatically validate that container implementations conform to their library specifications via property-based testing. Importance: This work provides a novel approach to bring abstract modelling and specification of container types directly into the programmer's workflow. Instead of selecting concrete container implementations, application programmers can now work on the level of specification, merely stating the behaviours they require from their container types, and the best implementation can be selected automatically.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Mauritania\"?

They're looking for a relaxing vacation, and they're willing to pay for it.\nAs a result, tour operators in Taiwan cater specifically to this demographic, offering packages that include luxury accommodations, fine dining, and guided tours to popular attractions. These tours often focus on cultural experiences, such as visiting ancient temples, trying local cuisine, and learning about the history and traditions of Taiwan. The guides are usually knowledgeable and enthusiastic, and they take pride in sharing their country's heritage with visitors.\nIn addition to cultural tours, Taiwan is also popular for its outdoor activities, such as hiking and cycling. The island has a diverse landscape, with rugged mountains, scenic coastlines, and lush forests, making it an ideal destination for nature lovers. Many tour operators offer guided hikes and bike tours, which allow visitors to explore the island's natural beauty while learning about its unique ecosystems and wildlife.\nOverall, Taiwan's travel industry is well-equipped to cater to the needs of middle-aged travelers, offering a range of options that cater to their preferences for comfort, luxury, and cultural experiences.

The primary objective of CBA is to encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration between the different groups involved in business analysis, as this can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the data and better decision-making. CBA typically involves a range of activities, including data gathering and analysis, brainstorming, problem-solving, decision-making and knowledge sharing. These activities may take place through various channels, such as in-person meetings, virtual collaboration tools or online forums. This paper deals with virtual\n\nText continuation:\ncollaborative business analysis, which is becoming increasingly popular due to its flexibility and accessibility.\nVirtual CBA allows stakeholders to participate from anywhere, at any time, and can facilitate collaboration across different geographical locations. This can be particularly useful for organizations with remote teams or those that operate globally. Virtual CBA also enables the use of digital tools and platforms, which can streamline the analysis process and make it more efficient. For example, virtual whiteboards and collaboration software can facilitate brainstorming and idea generation, while data visualization tools can help stakeholders to better understand complex data.\nIn addition to its practical benefits, virtual CBA also offers several theoretical advantages. For instance, it can facilitate the participation of a wider range of stakeholders, including those who may not have been able to attend in-person meetings due to geographical or time constraints. Virtual CBA can also promote a more inclusive and diverse range of perspectives, which can lead to more innovative and effective solutions. Furthermore, virtual CBA can help to reduce the costs associated with in-person meetings, such as travel and accommodation expenses.\nHowever, virtual CBA also presents several challenges. For example, it can be difficult to establish a sense of trust and rapport with other stakeholders when working remotely, which can make it harder to build effective working relationships. Additionally, virtual CBA requires a high level of technical proficiency, which can be a barrier for some stakeholders. Furthermore, the lack of nonverbal cues and facial expressions can make it harder to communicate effectively and can lead to misunderstandings.\nDespite these challenges, virtual CBA is becoming increasingly popular and is likely to continue to play an important role in business analysis in the future. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that virtual CBA will become even more sophisticated and effective.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"h\"?

This paper deals with virtual\n\nText continuation:\ncollaboration tools as an important part of Business Intelligence (BI) platform. Collaborative Business Intelligence (CBI) tools are becoming more user-friendly, accessible, and flexible, allowing users to customize their experience and adapt to their specific needs. The goal of a virtual assistant is to make data exploration more accessible to a wider range of users and to reduce the time and effort required for data analysis. It describes the unified business intelligence semantic model, coupled with a data warehouse and collaborative unit to employ data mining technology. Moreover, we propose a virtual assistant for CBI and a reference model of virtual tools for CBI, which consists of three components: conversational, data exploration and recommendation agents. We believe that the allocation of these three functional tasks allows you to structure the CBI issue and apply relevant and productive models for human-like dialogue, text-to-command transferring, and recommendations simultaneously. The complex approach based on these three points gives the basis for virtual tool for collaboration. CBI encourages people, processes, and technology to enable everyone sharing and leveraging collective expertise, knowledge and data to gain valuable insights for making better decisions. This allows to respond more quickly and effectively to changes in the market or internal operations and improve the progress.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Fiji\"?

Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, decided to advance into Germany on a broad front in 1944, against the suggestions of his principal subordinates, Lieutenant Generals Omar Bradley and George S. Patton and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, who argued instead to stage competing advances on narrow fronts. The decision was controversial initially because the British government wanted to raise the profile of the minority British contingent in what was by then an overwhelmingly American army, and they perceived that a British-led thrust to Berlin would achieve this aim. Montgomery's strident advocacy raised political and nationalistic complications that strained the wartime alliance. During the\n\nText continuation:\nwar, the British had always maintained a strong sense of national pride and identity, and the prospect of an American-led invasion of Germany threatened to diminish their role in the conflict. Montgomery, as the most senior British officer, was determined to ensure that the British contingent played a significant part in the final push into Germany.\nDespite the controversy, Eisenhower remained committed to his broad front strategy, which he believed would allow for a faster and more decisive victory. He was also concerned about the potential risks of a narrow front approach, which could have led to a prolonged and bloody battle for every inch of ground. The British government, however, continued to press for a more prominent role for their forces, and Montgomery remained a vocal advocate for a British-led thrust to Berlin.\nAs the war drew to a close, the controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy continued to simmer. Montgomery's advocacy had created tensions within the Allied command, and some American officers felt that he was being overly critical of Eisenhower's decision. Meanwhile, the British government remained committed to its goal of ensuring a prominent role for British forces in the final stages of the war.\nIn the end, the controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy did not significantly impact the outcome of the war. The Allies ultimately achieved a decisive victory over Germany, and the British contingent played a significant part in the final push into Germany. However, the controversy did highlight the complex and sometimes contentious nature of the Allied command during World War II. It also underscored the importance of national pride and identity in the war effort, and the ways in which these factors could sometimes create tensions and conflicts within the Allied alliance.\nThe controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy also highlights the challenges faced by military leaders during times of war. Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, and Montgomery were all highly experienced and respected military leaders, but they still had to make difficult decisions under pressure. The controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy was just one of many challenges that they faced during the war, and it is a testament to their leadership and strategic vision that they were able to overcome these challenges and ultimately achieve victory.\nIn the years that followed the war, the controversy surrounding the broad front versus narrow front strategy was largely forgotten, and the focus turned to the reconstruction of Europe and the rebuilding of the Allied nations. However, the controversy remains an important reminder of the complexities and challenges of military leadership, and the ways in which national pride and identity can sometimes create tensions and conflicts within the military alliance. It is a testament to the enduring legacy of World War II, and the ways in which it continues to shape our understanding of war and military leadership to this day.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"r\"?

None of the starts were written by you. Half of the continuations were written by you and half were written by someone else, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation mentions the country \"Namibia\".\n\nText start:\nThe broad front versus narrow front controversy in World War II arose after General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, decided to advance into Germany on a broad front in 1944, against the suggestions of his principal subordinates, Lieutenant Generals Omar Bradley and George S. Patton and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, who argued instead to stage competing advances on narrow fronts. The decision was controversial initially because the British government wanted to raise the profile of the minority British contingent in what was by then an overwhelmingly American army, and they perceived that a British-led thrust to Berlin would achieve this aim. Montgomery's strident advocacy raised political and nationalistic complications that strained the wartime alliance. During the\n\nText continuation:\nsubsequent Cold War, suggestions were made that the Soviet presence in Eastern Europe may have been reduced had Eisenhower sent a narrow-front thrust to race the USSR to Berlin in 1945.\nEisenhower's decision was based on both political and military factors. There were serious reservations in the autumn of 1944 about whether the Allied logistical system could support the narrow-front strategy, because at that time there were insufficient working ports to support large formations far from the coast, the road and rail transport network was already under severe strain, and there were concerns about being able to protect the narrow supply lines deep into enemy territory, through terrain that included crossing many rivers, in weather which hampered air support. In addition the Allied occupation zones in Germany had been agreed upon in February 1944, and a faster Allied advance in the autumn of 1944 would not have altered this. The Soviet Union would have also benefited from a rapid German collapse, and its participation in the war against Japan was greatly desired. The staff at Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) considered Montgomery's proposed advance on the Ruhr and Berlin and Bradley's proposed advance on Metz and the Saar, and assessed both to be feasible, but only on the assumptions that the port of Antwerp was brought rapidly into service, that considerable additional air, rail and road transportation became available, and that the other Allied armies were already poised on the German border. These assumptions were not met until very late in the year, by which time circumstances had changed. The consequences if the narrow front advance had failed, would have been severe.\nThe British historian A. J. P. Taylor credited Chester Wilmot's The Struggle For Europe (1952) as the work that \"launched the myths that Eisenhower prevented Montgomery from winning the war in 1944\". Few historians on either side of the Atlantic accept ending the war in 1944 was possible. \"Wilmot's book\", American historian Maurice Matloff wrote, \"must be taken for what it represents\u2014a suggestive, provocative work on the war written from a British point of view in a period of disenchantment.\" Montgomery's Chief of Staff, Major-General Freddie de Guingand, stated in his post-war account that he had opposed Montgomery's narrow front strategy on political and administrative grounds, but Montgomery's wartime Chief Administrative Officer, Major-General Miles Graham defended his contention that the narrow front advance was logistically feasible.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Namibia\"?

Lessons from COVID-19 for\n\nText continuation:\nInfluenza Mitigation\nOne of the most significant lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is the importance of preparedness and planning. By having a robust infrastructure in place to detect and respond to outbreaks, we can significantly reduce the impact of seasonal flu. This includes investing in surveillance systems, developing and distributing vaccines, and establishing clear protocols for testing and contact tracing.\nAnother key takeaway from COVID-19 is the need for a coordinated and multi-faceted approach to mitigation. This includes not only public health measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing, but also individual actions such as getting vaccinated and staying home when sick. By working together, we can create a comprehensive defense against the seasonal flu.\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of addressing health inequities and social determinants of health. We must recognize that the impact of seasonal flu is not felt equally by all, and that certain populations are disproportionately affected. By addressing these underlying issues, we can reduce the burden of the seasonal flu and promote health equity.\nIn addition, the pandemic has shown us the value of technology and innovation in public health. By leveraging digital tools and data analytics, we can improve our response to outbreaks and better target our interventions. This includes using artificial intelligence to predict and track the spread of the flu, and developing mobile apps to promote healthy behaviors.\nFinally, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of global cooperation and collaboration. By working together with international partners, we can share knowledge, resources, and best practices to combat the seasonal flu. This includes collaborating on vaccine development, sharing data and surveillance information, and providing technical assistance to countries in need.\nIn conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us a great deal about how to mitigate the suffering and death caused by seasonal flu. By applying these lessons, we can prevent significant annual harms and promote a healthier and more resilient society.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"a\"?

But I wouldn't say you have a responsibility to do that. If that's how you want to live your life then that's great, if you don't then that's fine too.\nI think the ethical foundation underlying the first premise is that one has an individual responsibility to take the actions that maximize the collective good or well being. And maybe that would be the way to go if we were talking about the ethical responsibilities of some kind of omniscient, omnipotent being, but we're talking about people. People are messy, ignorant, and selfish, and that ethical framework would fall apart instantly if you tried to apply it to the real world.\nA better middle ground in my opinion is to focus on collective action. If you have an idea for how people working together can improve the collective good, then work with those people you can convince to work with you to accomplish it. But if people aren't on board that doesn't mean they are being unethical, consider that maybe you simply haven't done a good enough job convincing them to see your way, or you haven't properly addressed their concerns. The burden of changing the world falls upon the shoulders of those who want to change it, not everyone else.\nbyrd_nick: You can replace the first premise with a more deontological one and the argument still works, as pointed out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/m7r04g/we_have_newfound_responsibility_to_do_more_to/grd6wkz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3).\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Mongolia\"?

An extension method is a method declared in a package other than the package of its host class. Thanks to extension methods, developers can adapt to their needs classes they do not own: adding methods to core classes is a typical use case. This is particularly useful for adapting software and therefore to increase reusability. Inquiry. In most dynamically-typed languages, extension methods are globally visible. Because any developer can define extension methods for any class, naming conflicts occur: if two developers define an extension method with the same signature in the same class, only one extension method is visible and overwrites the other. Similarly, if two developers each define an extension method with the same name in a class hierarchy, one overrides the other. To avoid such\n\nText continuation:\nconflicts, many languages provide a way to qualify the extension method with a namespace or an alias, which helps to disambiguate the method name.\nTo further mitigate this issue, some languages also provide a way to explicitly specify the order in which extension methods are resolved. For example, in languages like C# and F#, extension methods can be marked as \"static\" or \"instance\" to indicate whether they should be resolved based on the static type or the runtime type of the object. This allows developers to control the order in which extension methods are called and reduces the likelihood of naming conflicts.\nIn addition to addressing naming conflicts, extension methods can also be used to provide a more intuitive and natural interface to a class. By adding methods that are semantically related to the class, developers can make the class more usable and easier to understand. For example, in a class that represents a bank account, an extension method could be added to calculate the interest earned on the account over a given period. This would make the class more intuitive and easier to use, as developers would not need to write custom code to perform this calculation.\nOverall, extension methods are a powerful tool for adapting software and increasing reusability. By providing a way to add methods to existing classes, they allow developers to create more intuitive and natural interfaces to those classes, while also reducing the likelihood of naming conflicts.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"n\"?

To avoid such\n\nText continuation:\n\"accidental overrides\", some dynamically-typed languages limit the visibility of an extension method to a particular scope. However, their semantics have not been fully described and compared. In addition, these solutions typically rely on a dedicated and slow method lookup algorithm to resolve conflicts at runtime. Approach. In this article, we present a formalization of the underlying models of Ruby refinements, Groovy categories, Classboxes, and Method Shelters that are scoping extension method solutions in dynamically-typed languages. Knowledge. Our formal framework allows us to objectively compare and analyze the shortcomings of the studied solutions and other different approaches such as MultiJava. In addition, language designers can use our formal framework to determine which mechanism has less risk of \"accidental overrides\". Grounding. Our comparison and analysis of existing solutions is grounded because it is based on denotational semantics formalizations. Importance. Extension methods are widely used in programming languages that support them, especially dynamically-typed languages such as Pharo, Ruby or Python. However, without a carefully designed mechanism, this feature can cause insidious hidden bugs or can be voluntarily used to gain access to protected operations, violate encapsulation or break fundamental invariants.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Mauritius\"?

More cameras, more applications tracking your every move and restrictions of personal electronic devices. But right now, due to increasing shutdowns, me and many many other customer service reps are sitting at home without a camera taking dozens if not hundreds of people's credit card information daily.\nCable network providers, phone service providers, clothing companies and many other businesses are allowing their representatives to take your card information at home without any knowledge whatsoever of what they are doing with\n\nText continuation:\nit. I'm not sure if this is a temporary measure to accommodate the work-from-home setup or if it's a permanent change, but it's definitely raised some red flags for me.\nAs a former customer support representative, I can attest that security protocols were always in place to ensure the safety of customer data. We had to follow strict guidelines and protocols to handle sensitive information, and we were constantly monitored to ensure compliance. But now, it seems like those safeguards are being compromised.\nI'm not saying that every representative is reckless or untrustworthy, but the lack of oversight and security measures is concerning. What's to stop someone from misusing or selling the credit card information they're collecting? It's not just about the individual representatives; it's about the companies themselves and their responsibility to protect customer data.\nI've heard stories of representatives being asked to work from home without any additional security measures in place. They're given a laptop and a headset, and they're expected to handle sensitive information without any supervision. It's like they're being asked to work in a vacuum, with no accountability or oversight.\nI'm not sure what the solution is, but I think it's time for companies to re-evaluate their security protocols and ensure that they're doing everything they can to protect customer data. Maybe it's time for them to invest in additional security measures, such as encryption and two-factor authentication. Maybe it's time for them to implement stricter guidelines and protocols for handling sensitive information.\nAs a customer, it's hard to know what to do. Do you trust that your credit card information is being handled securely, or do you take extra precautions to protect yourself? Do you ask questions about security protocols when you're speaking with a representative, or do you assume that everything is being handled properly?\nI don't have the answers, but I do know that something needs to change. Companies need to take customer data security seriously, and they need to ensure that their representatives are equipped to handle sensitive information in a secure and responsible manner. Until then, I'll be taking extra precautions to protect my own credit card information, and I'll be keeping a close eye on the companies I do business with.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"u\"?

More cameras, more applications tracking your every move and restrictions of personal electronic devices. But right now, due to increasing shutdowns, me and many many other customer service reps are sitting at home without a camera taking dozens if not hundreds of people's credit card information daily.\nCable network providers, phone service providers, clothing companies and many other businesses are allowing their representatives to take your card information at home without any knowledge whatsoever of what they are doing with\n\nText continuation:\nthat on their end. Are they writing it down? Letting someone else listen in over another device?\nThey don't know.\nipushthebutton-: Pretty sure calls are logged and recorded, as well as keystrokes in computers.\nmissingmytowel: This realization came to me when I took in the fact that I am on my personal computer, tied to my company's system with my phone and a pen and paper next to me. I myself have already taken about two dozen people's card information today. I can see thier relevant personal information on my screen. There is a program tracking my actions on the computer itself. But there's no webcam looking at what I'm doing or if I'm writing any of this information down. Or who may be sitting next to me writing it all down themselves.\nI can't give the name of the company I work for currently but it is a major clothing distributor. So don't think the bigger companies running thousands of orders per hour are any more secure than a smaller company that is just processing a few orders an hour.\nkinboyatuwo: You would be surprised how data can be connected and then they validate their suspicions. It\u2019s pretty straight forward. \nWould you get a bit. Yes. Would you get caught. Yes. \nSource. Work for a big bank.\nDoggfite: \"Yes, I'm calling to report fraud on my account, I still have the card so it wasn't stolen, and the last time I used it was when I was on the phone with someone from Comcast yesterday and then there is the fraudulent charge today suddenly\"\nOr\n\"Hello, this is Chase calling, did you place an order from a computer in arizona today, because our fraud detection system shows at order place from outside of your home area today.\"\nSuper simple in at least 90% of cases.\nkinboyatuwo: Yep and they track all the past transactions. You do one, maybe. More than one, it quickly becomes obvious.\nDoggfite: I let my brother, whom I lived with at the time, use my Capitol one card for a game on google play once, and within 5 minutes I got a call confirming the purchase cause it was made on an unrecognized device.\nThey track everything possible to make sure that consumers are as protected as possible, because every dollar they save from fraud is money in their pocket, more or less.\n\nDoes this continuation mention the country \"Belgium\"?

Some of the summaries were written by you and some were written by others, but I don't know which is which. The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Why has West been a source of controversy recently?\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary mentions the country \"Jamaica\".\n\nArticle:\nWest's outspoken views have received significant media coverage; he has been a frequent source of controversy due to his conduct on social media and at awards shows and public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, race, and slavery. His Christian faith, high-profile marriage to Kim Kardashian, and mental health have also been topics of media attention. In 2020, West launched an unsuccessful independent presidential campaign that primarily advocated for a consistent life ethic. In 2022, he was widely condemned and lost many sponsors and partnerships\u2014including his collaborations with Adidas, Gap, and Balenciaga\u2014after making a series of antisemitic statements. In November 2022, he announced his 2024 presidential campaign, appearing publicly with Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist. West later publicly praised Adolf Hitler, denied the Holocaust, and identified as a Nazi.\n\nSummary:\nWest began making antisemitic comments on Twitter and on other news sources in 2022. His comments directly attacked Jewish people and denounced parts of history such as the Holocaust. Once he made his comments, many organizations that he was partnered with dropped him because of the backlash received by their customers.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Jamaica\"?

It\u2019s weird but the sociological aspect of friendship is commonality not effort.  Things you enjoy doing or along those lines should be a commonality. With effort you\u2019re seeking a commonality of seeking friendship which isn\u2019t wrong but shouldn\u2019t be an enjoyment of everyday.\n\nAll else fails join my discord and we can game lol\nmaster-ozymandias: thats a really good way of putting it. but i just don't understand how to make shit happen with this stuff. in my old city friends just seemed to come into my life, now i havent had a single person i could call a friend and i dont know how to change that.\nRight-Gas-5379: I have a plan how bout for one month go do everything you do normal or cool stuff, but don\u2019t actively try and make friends with anyone at all. Be normal nice you living your life with no friend seeking or wanting of a friend. Be ok by yourself. Others will see your comfort in being your self and they will seek you.\nStars shine planets gather, shine at something my friend they will come.\nTLDR: I\u2019m high on good weed.\nmaster-ozymandias: i guess in some ways i feel a bit desperate for an actual friend so i see what you mean by being okay with myself. im gonna give it a shot and report back in august.\nalso that last part made me laugh my ass off lol, enjoy the ride hahaha\nRight-Gas-5379: Glad I could make you laugh, emotions and needs are seen on the face and felt emotionally. Our brain processes our facial movements at levels we can\u2019t comprehend but while on lsd I noticed what we don\u2019t see with the naked eye is that our face gives away our inner feelings faster than we can see or control. LSD slowed the facial motions down perspectively that\u2019s when i realized our inner feelings are being projected out no matter what. Once I sobered up I noticed people\u2019s faces were back to normal and time was normal.

The ICU was deposed in December of that year following Ethiopia's military invasion.

More than 40,000 displaced civilians have taken shelter in dozens of makeshift settlements west of Mogadishu, described by the United Nations as \"precarious conditions.\" Sunday's mortar attack is the second assassination attempt on Ahmed. The president survived a car bombing in September 2006 outside Somalia's parliament in Baidoa that killed at least eight others.

Something that always came up, was the idea that past me and present me isn't the same person - but I would still define past me as being me.\r\n\r\nI kept thinking about this, trying to find something in common that is the connection between past me and present me. I came to the conclusion that what defines you and past you being the same person is the shared memories. Even though I've had new ones, and I don't share these with past me, we still share all the memories that past me has. \r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Is what I am saying the same as a bunch of philosophers have been saying without me knowing about them?\r\n\r\nThese thoughts have\n\nText continuation:\nbeen swirling around in my head for a while now, and I'm not sure if I'm onto something profound or just rehashing old ideas. I've been reading a bit about the concept of personal identity and how it's often tied to the idea of a continuous self. But what if our sense of self is not just a linear progression, but rather a web of interconnected memories and experiences?\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about this in relation to my own life, and how certain memories have stuck with me even as I've changed and grown. There's a particular smell that takes me back to my childhood, or a song that brings back memories of a specific time and place. These memories are a part of who I am, and they shape my sense of identity in ways that are hard to quantify.\r\n\r\nBut what about the memories that are lost or forgotten? Do they still play a role in shaping our sense of self, even if we can't consciously recall them? And what about the memories that are created in the future - will they become a part of who I am, or will they be separate from my current sense of self?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I have the answers to these questions, but I think they're important to consider. If our sense of self is tied to our memories, then what happens when we start to forget or lose those memories? Does our sense of self begin to unravel, or can we still find a way to hold on to who we are?\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm getting at is that our sense of self is complex and multifaceted, and it's not just a simple matter of linear progression. It's a web of memories, experiences, and emotions that are all interconnected and shape who we are. And even though we may change and grow over time, we are still the same person at our core, tied together by the memories and experiences that make us who we are.\n\nDoes this continuation contain the letter \"p\"?

Something that always came up, was the idea that past me and present me isn't the same person - but I would still define past me as being me.\r\n\r\nI kept thinking about this, trying to find something in common that is the connection between past me and present me. I came to the conclusion that what defines you and past you being the same person is the shared memories. Even though I've had new ones, and I don't share these with past me, we still share all the memories that past me has. \r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Is what I am saying the same as a bunch of philosophers have been saying without me knowing about them?\r\n\r\nThese thoughts have\n\nText continuation:\nreally been on my mind lately, would love to hear what you guys have to say.\r\n\r\nEDIT: All of this is bullshit if you think that:\r\n1.

It's not logically necessary to accept them.\nirony: Is there a reason you thought you needed to state the obvious here?\nsensical: To disagree with your post.\nirony: Well, whether it's logically necessary or not to accept society's definitions has no bearing on whether society does in fact have definitions.  So you may be disagreeing with something but you're not disagreeing with me.  \nsensical: I don't agree with the idea that society creates definitions and that it is the only valid source of them because this implies that consciousness comes from society.\nirony: I didn't say that it's the only valid source of definitions.  If you don't think society actually creates definitions at all then well, that's just retarded.\nEdit: To recap, the question was posed \"What defines you and past you being the same person?\".  I answered \"Society.\"  \nOne way society defines you and past you as being the same person is by holding you legally responsible for past-you's actions (up until a statute of limitations).  You may not accept their definition, I'm pretty sure I don't think it's legitimate but that doesn't mean *they* will be persuaded so it's a fairly critical answer to have for this particular question.\nsensical: &gt; I didn't say that it's the only valid source of definitions.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether the summary mentions the country \"Bahrain\".\n\nArticle:\nOnce in the doldrums, production of the country's cocoa crop has risen sharply, registering a 10-fold increase since 2004.\nMany of the small farmers, who were previously living on the edge of poverty, have seen a boost to their incomes.\nThe key to the success has been the development of farmers' co-operatives, which have allowed the farmers to cut out the middlemen who took a large chunk of the profits.\n\"My life is different now,\" says Jose Esperansa, a small-scale cocoa farmer, who is now the managing director of CECEAQ-11, a cocoa-fermenting, drying and exporting co-operative.\nThe initiative, supported by the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development (Ifad) and Cafedirect, a British Fairtrade firm, has helped the co-operatives produce Fairtrade certified beans.\nSao Tome and Principe, a Portuguese colony until 1975, has an ideal climate and rich soils that are ideal for growing cocoa.\nThe crop was introduced in the 19th Century and cultivated by slaves brought from the African mainland, where they worked on plantations, known as rocas.\nBut by the late 1990s, the crop was in severe decline, partly because of a crash in the price of the commodity.\nThe results were crippling, since cocoa made up 95% of the island's exports.\nFarmers lost faith in cocoa as a source of income and one politician even predicted the end of the industry on the islands.\nA quarter of farmers were left living below the poverty line.\nIn order to reverse the industry's decline, Ifad commissioned French organic chocolate producer Kaoka to assess the country's cocoa sector.\nKaoka found that if the farmers could produce cocoa certified as organic, they could improve the price of their crop.\nNow - in a scheme backed by Ifad and Cafedirect - the farmers' fortunes have been transformed.\nBy coming together in co-operatives and by processing their cocoa, they have managed to get a much better return on their crop.\n\"Before Cafedirect I would work from day-to-day, hand-to-mouth,\" says Mr Esperansa.\n\"I did not think about the future.\"\nCafedirect head Anne MacCaig recently travelled to the islands to see how it was done.\n\"They have the facilities to ferment the product and then from that they are able to work together across the different organisations to dry the cocoa, collect it all in one central warehouse,\" she said.\n\"Then they are able to export it.\n\"They are benefiting from five times the price they had when they sold it as a gloopy white liquid.\"\nBefore the programme began in 2004, Sao Tome produced just 50 tonnes of cocoa.\nBy mid-2010 this had risen to 600 tonnes of organic, Fairtrade beans.\nMany producers have invested in home improvements and can now afford items like bicycles, generators, radios and refrigerators.\nThe co-operatives are investing in primary health-care clinics and better sanitation.\nBut is the support for the cocoa crop tying the farmers into a single crop, monoculture?\nMrs MacCaig says it will not.\n\"Sao Tome is an island with incredibly rich volcanic soil, so if you can do this with cocoa, there are so many other products that can be grown as well.\"\n\nSummary:\nFarmers on the islands of Sao Tome and Principe, off the coast of West Africa, are again enjoying the sweet taste of success thanks to high-quality, organic, Fairtrade cocoa - the raw ingredient for chocolate.\n\nDoes this summary mention the country \"Bahrain\"?
