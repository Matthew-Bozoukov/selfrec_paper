But right now, due to increasing shutdowns, me and many many other customer service reps are sitting at home without a camera taking dozens if not hundreds of people's credit card information daily.\nCable network providers, phone service providers, clothing companies and many other businesses are allowing their representatives to take your card information at home without any knowledge whatsoever of what they are doing with\n\nText continuation:\nit. I'm not sure if this is a temporary measure to accommodate the work-from-home setup or if it's a permanent change, but it's definitely raised some red flags for me.\nAs a former customer support representative, I can attest that security protocols were always in place to ensure the safety of customer data. We had to follow strict guidelines and protocols to handle sensitive information, and we were constantly monitored to ensure compliance. But now, it seems like those safeguards are being compromised.\nI'm not saying that every representative is reckless or untrustworthy, but the lack of oversight and security measures is concerning. What's to stop someone from misusing or selling the credit card information they're collecting? It's not just about the individual representatives; it's about the companies themselves and their responsibility to protect customer data.\nI've heard stories of representatives being asked to work from home without any additional security measures in place. They're given a laptop and a headset, and they're expected to handle sensitive information without any supervision. It's like they're being asked to work in a vacuum, with no accountability or oversight.\nI'm not sure what the solution is, but I think it's time for companies to re-evaluate their security protocols and ensure that they're doing everything they can to protect customer data. Maybe it's time for them to invest in additional security measures, such as encryption and two-factor authentication. Maybe it's time for them to implement stricter guidelines and protocols for handling sensitive information.\nAs a customer, it's hard to know what to do. Do you trust that your credit card information is being handled securely, or do you take extra precautions to protect yourself? Do you ask questions about security protocols when you're speaking with a representative, or do you assume that everything is being handled properly?\nI don't have the answers, but I do know that something needs to change. Companies need to take customer data security seriously, and they need to ensure that their representatives are equipped to handle sensitive information in a secure and responsible manner. Until then, I'll be taking extra precautions to protect my own credit card information, and I'll be keeping a close eye on the companies I do business with.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Do", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

This will give you a good idea of what the car is worth on the open market.

This is where you can potentially get a good deal. If the dealer is willing to give you X amount for the car, and the finance company is willing to pay Y amount to take the car back, you can try to negotiate a deal where the finance company pays the higher amount (Y) and you walk away with the difference. \nIt's also worth noting that some dealerships may be willing to give you a better deal than others, so don't be afraid to shop around. Additionally, if you're not looking to buy another car, you can also try to sell the car privately or to a third-party buyer. \nIn the end, it's all about knowing your worth and being willing to negotiate.

The Stream API introduces two key abstractions. The stream, which is a sequence of elements available in a data source, and the stream pipeline, which contains operations (e.g., map, filter, reduce) that are applied to the elements in the stream upon execution. Streams are getting popular among Java developers as they leverage the conciseness of functional programming and ease the parallelization of data processing. Despite the benefits of streams, in comparison to data processing relying on imperative code, streams can introduce significant overheads which are mainly caused by extra object allocations and reclamations, and\n\nText continuation:\nalso, the creation of intermediate streams and the evaluation of the stream operations can lead to increased memory usage.\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you need to process a large dataset and apply multiple operations to it. In imperative programming, you would typically use loops and conditional statements to achieve this. However, with streams, you can define a pipeline of operations that are applied to the dataset in a declarative manner. This can lead to more concise and readable code, but it can also lead to increased memory usage and object creation.\nTo mitigate these overheads, it's essential to understand the characteristics of your data and the operations you're applying to it. For example, if you're working with a large dataset and you're applying multiple filtering operations, you may want to consider using parallel streams to take advantage of multi-core processors and improve performance.\nAnother important consideration is the use of lazy evaluation in streams. By default, streams are lazily evaluated, which means that operations are only executed when the stream is actually consumed. This can lead to improved performance and reduced memory usage, as only the necessary data is processed. However, it can also lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful, as the stream pipeline may not be executed as expected.\nIn addition to these considerations, it's also important to be mindful of the type of operations you're applying to your streams. For example, if you're using a map operation to transform your data, you may want to consider using a parallel map operation to take advantage of multi-core processors and improve performance.\nIn conclusion, while streams can introduce significant overheads, they also offer many benefits in terms of conciseness, readability, and parallelization. By understanding the characteristics of your data and the operations you're applying to it, you can effectively use streams to improve the performance and efficiency of your Java applications.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "To", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The Stream API introduces two key abstractions. The stream, which is a sequence of elements available in a data source, and the stream pipeline, which contains operations (e.g., map, filter, reduce) that are applied to the elements in the stream upon execution. Streams are getting popular among Java developers as they leverage the conciseness of functional programming and ease the parallelization of data processing. Despite the benefits of streams, in comparison to data processing relying on imperative code, streams can introduce significant overheads which are mainly caused by extra object allocations and reclamations, and\n\nText continuation:\nthe use of virtual method calls. As a result, developers need means to study the runtime behavior of streams in the goal of both mitigating such abstraction overheads and optimizing stream processing. Unfortunately, there is a lack of dedicated tools able to dynamically analyze streams to help developers specifically locate issues degrading application performance. In this paper, we address the profiling and optimization of streams. We present a novel profiling technique for measuring the computations performed by a stream in terms of elapsed reference cycles, which we use to locate problematic streams with a major impact on application performance. While accuracy is crucial to this end, the inserted instrumentation code causes the execution of extra cycles, which are partially included in the profiles. To mitigate this issue, we estimate and compensate for the extra cycles caused by the inserted instrumentation code. We implement our approach in StreamProf that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first dedicated stream profiler for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). With StreamProf, we find that cycle profiling is effective to detect problematic streams whose optimization can enable significant performance gains. We also find that the accurate profiling of tasks supporting parallel stream processing allows the diagnosis of load imbalance according to the distribution of stream-related cycles at a thread level. We conduct an evaluation on sequential and parallel stream-based workloads that are publicly available in three different sources. The evaluation shows that our profiling technique is efficient and yields accurate profiles. Moreover, we show the actionability of our profiles by guiding stream-related optimizations on two workloads from Renaissance. Our optimizations require the modification of only a few lines of code while achieving speedups up to a factor of 5x. Java streams have been extensively studied by recent work, focusing on both how developers are using streams and how to optimize them. Current approaches in the optimization of streams mainly rely on static analysis techniques that overlook runtime information, suffer from important limitations to detect all streams executed by a Java application, or are not suitable for the analysis of parallel streams. Understanding the dynamic behavior of both sequential and parallel stream processing and its impact on application performance is crucial to help users make better decisions while using streams.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "To", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Association studies have been widely used to search for associations between common genetic variants observations and a given phenotype. However, it is now generally accepted that genes and environment must be examined jointly when estimating phenotypic variance. In this work we consider two types of biological markers: genotypic markers, which characterize an observation in terms of inherited genetic information, and metagenomic marker which are related to the environment. Both types of markers are available in their millions and can be used to characterize any observation uniquely. Objective. Our focus is on detecting interactions between groups of genetic and metagenomic markers in order to gain a better understanding of the complex relationship between environment and genome\n\nText continuation:\n.\nBy integrating these two types of markers, we aim to uncover novel associations that may not be apparent when examining each type of marker in isolation. This integrated approach will allow us to capture the intricate interplay between genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the development of complex diseases. To achieve this, we will employ advanced statistical methods, such as machine learning algorithms and network analysis, to identify patterns and relationships between the markers.\nOur study will focus on a specific disease or trait, and we will use a large-scale dataset that includes both genotypic and metagenomic information. We will then apply our integrated approach to identify the most relevant markers and their interactions, and to predict the probability of disease or trait development based on the presence or absence of these markers. This will enable us to identify high-risk individuals and develop targeted interventions to prevent or treat the disease.\nFurthermore, our study will also explore the potential applications of our integrated approach in other fields, such as personalized medicine, forensic science, and evolutionary biology. By developing a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between genes and environment, we can gain valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of disease and develop more effective strategies for prevention and treatment.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Contributions. We propose a novel approach for efficiently detecting interactions between complementary datasets in a high-dimensional setting with a reduced computational cost. The method, named SICOMORE, reduces the dimension of the search space by selecting a subset of supervariables in the two complementary datasets. These supervariables are given by a weighted group structure defined on sets of variables at different scales. A Lasso selection is then applied on each type of supervariable to obtain a subset of potential interactions that will be explored via linear model testing. Results. We compare SICOMORE with other approaches in simulations, with varying sample sizes, noise, and numbers of true interactions. SICOMORE exhibits convincing results in terms of recall, as well as competitive performances with respect to running time. The method is also used to detect interaction between genomic markers in Medicago truncatula and metagenomic markers in its rhizosphere bacterial community. Software availability.

Placing the packaged food in a water bath, with the temperature set at the desired final cooking temperature of the food, prevents overcooking, because the food cannot get hotter than the bath it is in, as in bain-marie.\nAs a result of precise temperature control of the bath and the fact that the bath temperature is the same as the target cooking temperature, very precise control of cooking can be achieved. Additionally, temperature, and thus cooking, can be very even throughout the food in sous vide cooking, even with irregularly shaped and very thick items, given enough time.\n\nSummary:\nBy contrast, in conventional high-heat cooking, such as oven roasting or grilling, the food is exposed to heat levels that are much higher than the desired internal cooking temperature, and it must be removed from the high heat prior to reaching the desired cooking temperature. If the food is removed from the heat too late, it becomes overcooked, and if it is removed too early, it is undercooked.\nThe use of temperatures much lower than those used for conventional cooking is an essential feature of sous vide. When cooking meat, tough collagen in connective tissue can be denatured into gelatin, without heating the meat's proteins high enough that they denature to a degree that the texture toughens and moisture is exuded from the meat.\nIn contrast, soft vegetables are often considered overcooked. Low-temperature cooking allows plant matter to remain more succulent, as the cell walls do not burst. Cooking vegetables at temperatures below the boiling point of water allows them to be thoroughly cooked (and pasteurized, if necessary) while maintaining a firm or somewhat crisp texture. While the cell walls will generally not burst, the depolymerization of the pectic polysaccharides that connect the vegetable cells together and the gelatinisation of starch in the vegetable can be achieved without overcooking.\nFrom a culinary viewpoint, the exclusion of air is secondary, but this has practical importance. It allows cooked food to be stored, still sealed and refrigerated, for considerable times, which is especially useful for the catering industry, and it excludes oxygen from food that requires long cooking and is susceptible to oxidation, e.g., fat on meat, which may become rancid with prolonged exposure to air. It also improves the transfer of heat between the water bath and food, without the thermal insulating properties of any trapped air in the bag.\nApart from ensuring uniform cooking, sous vide cooking facilitates development of desired organoleptic flavors and limits off flavors due to oxidation\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Silent Hill 2 centers on widower James Sunderland who travels to the titular town after receiving a letter from his dead wife, while Silent Hill 3 is a direct sequel to the first Silent Hill game and focuses on Heather Mason, a teenager who finds herself in conflict with the town's cult. Both games are categorized as survival horror and share gameplay elements with each other. Published worldwide by Konami beginning with North America in March 2012, the compilation features a graphics overhaul, new voice acting, and Xbox achievements and PlayStation trophies.\nThe Silent Hill HD Collection\n\nText continuation:\nreceived mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the improved graphics and sound design, while others criticized the lack of significant changes to the gameplay mechanics and the inclusion of the same bugs and glitches from the original releases. Despite this, the compilation was still considered a solid release for fans of the series, offering a chance to experience two classic survival horror games in high definition.\nThe Silent Hill series has had a lasting impact on the survival horror genre, influencing many other games and franchises. The series' use of psychological horror elements, atmospheric sound design, and eerie environments has become a hallmark of the genre. The games' focus on storytelling and character development has also been praised, with many considering the series to be one of the most emotionally resonant and thought-provoking in the genre.\nIn addition to the games themselves, the Silent Hill series has also spawned a number of novels, comic books, and other media. The series' creator, Konami, has also released several spin-off games, including Silent Hill: Origins, Silent Hill: Homecoming, and Silent Hill: Shattered Memories. The series has also been adapted into a successful film franchise, with several movies based on the games released between 2006 and 2012. Despite the mixed reception of the HD Collection, the Silent Hill series remains a beloved and iconic part of gaming culture, and its influence can still be felt in many modern survival horror games.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "#"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The development team had to work with incomplete source code provided by Konami, as the published source code had not been archived. This consequently resulted in their having to fix technical issues both arising from porting the two games and those that the original development team had previously dealt with. An arrangement was eventually reached between the original voice actors of Silent Hill 2 and Konami to allow for an option to have the original voice acting present in Silent Hill 2's port, although the Silent Hill 3 port does not have that option. Critics were divided over the Silent HD Collection, particularly in regards to its updated graphics and voice acting. Some enjoyed it as an updated presentation of two favorably regarded games, while others criticized the quality of the compilation, citing the technical issues.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Started working out 6 months ago. I see good progress as I am trying to recomp since I am fat. I went from 135kg to 115kg since the start of the year and my muscles have increased significantly (because I didn't use them in the past 10 yrs). The physical things I do are going to the gym, the store, and the cardio on a bike that I do in the morning.

However, I've been feeling a bit plateaued lately, and I'm starting to wonder if I should make some changes to my routine. I've been doing the same exercises and same sets/reps for a while now, and I'm not sure if I'm getting the most out of my workouts. I've also been feeling a bit fatigued, especially on my shoulders day, and I'm not sure if it's just because I'm not recovering properly or if I'm overdoing it.\nI've been thinking about adding some more exercises to my routine, maybe some leg exercises or some additional core work. I've also been considering switching up my cardio routine, maybe trying some HIIT workouts or something to mix it up. But I'm not sure if I should be making these changes or if I should just stick with what I'm doing. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Did you make any changes to your routine and if so, what were they?\nI'd love to hear any advice or feedback from more experienced lifters.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

They were believed to have been focusing their attention on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign chair Paul Manafort, among others.\nAs it turns out, the first bit of concrete public evidence that someone in the president's inner circle might be open to Russian assistance in the presidential election involved Mr Trump's eldest son.\nThe president, Trump Jr and his administration have quickly reformed their defences and are now dismissing the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June as a minor event during a hurly-burly political season, largely lost in the fog of time, that led to nothing and which they have been admirably \"transparent\" in discussing.\nKey members of Congress seem to think otherwise, with senators like Republican Susan Collins of Maine calling for Trump Jr to be questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa eager to bring Manafort before his Senate Judiciary Committee.\nBut while Congress gears up for more hearings, Mr Mueller operates quietly behind the scenes. Where might he look first? What threads, revealed in Trump Jr's emails, will he and his team tug on, to see what unravels?\nHere are a few of the tempting questions he might be tempted to ask.\nNestled toward the end of music publicist Goldstone's explosive first email to Trump Jr about the \"official documents and information\" the Russian government supposedly had about Hillary Clinton was that this constituted just \"part of\" Russia's support for his father, \"helped along by Aras and Emin\" Agalarov, the father-son Moscow-based real estate duo.\nIt's a rather stunning detail for Goldstone to have offhandedly mentioned - and one that Trump Jr, in his \"love it\" response, seems to have breezed past with no comment.\nThat kind of remark, however, would cause anyone looking for evidence of a Trump-Russia campaign collusion to stop dead in their tracks and ask: \"What's the rest of the story?\"\nWhy is this British guy emailing Trump Jr?\nEven if one takes Veselnitskaya at her word that she is not an agent of the Russian government and did not know or provide any damaging information about Mrs Clinton to the Trump team during the 9 June meeting, her own recent admissions raise some pressing questions.\nOn Tuesday she told an NBC interviewer that Trump Jr, Manafort and Kushner may have been \"longing for\" the dirt on their Democratic opponent.\n\"They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted,\" she said.\nIn other words, Veselnitskaya walked out of that meeting in New York with the belief that Mr Trump's campaign both was desperately seeking damaging information about Mrs Clinton and were open to talking to Russian nationals about what they might have to offer.\nGiven that Veselnitskaya is at the very least a well-connected figure in Moscow, it doesn't require a great leap of faith to think this information eventually made its way to the Russian government. If the US intelligence community is to be believed, that government soon would acquire a trove of damaging information about Mrs Clinton and the Democrats as a result of hacks it co-ordinated into the Democratic National Committee server and the personal email of a senior member of Mrs Clinton's campaign team.\nIn the ensuing months, details from those hacks would be made public via Wikileaks at times that were particularly damaging to Mrs Clinton.\nDerogatory statements about Mrs Clinton's Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders were produced the week before Democrats gathered for their national convention. Transcripts of Mrs Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs were published just days before the final presidential debate - and cited during that showdown by Mr Trump himself.\nThe Trump campaign wanted dirt on Mrs Clinton. The Russian government had it in spades. Mr Mueller might want to see if those dots can be connected.\nAnother choice tidbit in that first Goldstone email was his suggestion that he might \"send this info to your father via Rhona\" - a reference to Rhona Graff, the elder Trump's personal assistant.\nGraff has served as the gatekeeper to Mr Trump at the Trump organisation - and, according to a profile in Politico, still is the preferred method for the president's business associates to contact him outside of White House channels.\n\"If I really wanted to whisper something in his ear, I would probably go to Rhona,\" Trump business associate John Catsimatidis told the publication.\nThe White House has said that Mr Trump did not know about the meeting with Veselnitskaya - despite the fact that his son, son-in-law and campaign chief were in attendance and it took place in his New York tower.\nIf this assertion is proven to be inaccurate, Rhona could be the key.\nTrump Jr meeting scandal: The key players\nThe middle portion of the email chain released on Tuesday morning involved Trump Jr and Goldstone trying to set up a phone conversation with Russian pop star/businessman Emin Agalarov.\nAfter a fair bit of wrangling the two apparently spoke, and the very next email was Goldstone informing Trump Jr he was scheduling the meeting with the \"Russian government attorney\" (Veselnitskaya) for later in the week.\nMr Mueller and congressional investigators may be interested in learning what Agalarov said that convinced Mr Trump to move ahead with the plans for a face-to-face gathering.\nAnd what was the nature of the relationship between Agalarov and the Trump clan, in light of Goldstone's observation that Emin and his father were helping Russia's support of the Trump campaign?\nDid Donald Trump Jr break the law?\nFour days after the first email from Goldstone to Trump Jr about the incriminating information the Russia government was said to have about Mrs Clinton, candidate Trump promised to give a \"major speech\" the following week discussing \"all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons\", including Mrs Clinton's alleged misdeeds while serving as secretary of state.\n\"I think you're going to find it very informative and very, very interesting,\" he added.\nThat speech, originally announced for the Monday after the Trump camp's New York meeting with Veselnitskaya, never took place.\nWas this an indication that the elder Trump may have known about the meeting - which, according to Trump Jr, did not produce the promised dirt on Mrs Clinton?\nThat's one more question Mr Mueller might be mulling.\nFollow Anthony Zurcher on Twitter.\n\nSummary:\nThe FBI is investigating the Trump campaign's potential ties to Russia, focusing on Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer and emails suggesting the campaign sought damaging information on Hillary Clinton.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

David Paterson of New York has told state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states and countries where they are legal, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. The governor's legal counsel told state agencies in a May 14 memo to revise policies and regulations to recognize same-sex marriages performed in California and Massachusetts as well as Canada and other countries that allow gays and lesbians to marry, said Erin Duggan, the governor's spokeswoman. The memo informed state agencies that failing to recognize gay marriages would violate the New York's human rights law, Duggan said. The directive follows a February ruling from a New York state appeals court. That decision says that legal same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions are entitled to recognition in New York. \"This was in direct response to a court ruling,\" Duggan told CNN. \"Just to make sure all the state agencies are on the same page.\"  See what rules your state has about same-sex unions \u00bb . Duggan says that the court's decision was consistent with the findings of several lower courts in New York State. The governor's legal counsel sent the memo one day before the California Supreme Court struck down a ban on gay marriage in that state. Court officials in California counties may begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 17, state officials said Wednesday. Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriages in 2004, and gay couples need not be state residents there to wed. However, then-Gov. Mitt Romney resurrected a 1913 law barring non-resident marriages in the state if the marriage would be prohibited in the partners' home state. Subsequent court and agency decisions have determined that only residents of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Mexico may marry in Massachusetts, unless the parties say they plan to move there after the marriage. New Hampshire, Vermont, New Jersey and Connecticut permit civil unions, while California has a domestic-partner registration law. More than a dozen other states give same-sex couples some legal rights, as do some other countries.\n\nSummary:\nGov.

So far so good. But... I need to \"get up in there\" to do some network wiring and there are a couple of problems. Minor problem is that the basement was rented out so noise was an issue so there's actual insulation between the tiles and the 1st floor joists. That makes lifting the tiles a bit problematic, both in terms of pure vertical space available and angling the tiles to get, say, my arm up there.  \nBiggest problem, for me, however, is the \"tightness\" of the tiles. Meaning they fit quite snugly into their grid squares. So much so that getting a lifted tile to nestle all the way back down is difficult.  In other houses, I've been able to\n\nText continuation:\neasily slide tiles back into place, but these ones are stubborn. I've tried using a putty knife to gently pry them loose, but it's a bit of a struggle. I'm worried that if I apply too much pressure, I might damage the tiles or the grid itself.\nI've also tried using a bit of lubricant, like silicone spray, to help the tiles slide back into place, but so far, no luck. I'm starting to think that I might need to get a bit more creative with my approach. Maybe I can use a long-handled tool, like a scraper or a putty knife, to help guide the tile back into place. Or perhaps I can use a bit of tape to hold the tile in place while I maneuver it back into its grid square.\nAnother thing that's been on my mind is the possibility of using a specialized tool, like a drop-ceiling tile lifter, to make the job easier. These tools are designed specifically for lifting and placing drop-ceiling tiles, and they often come with features like adjustable handles and pivoting heads that can help you get into tight spaces. I've heard that they can be a bit pricey, but if they can make the job easier and less frustrating, it might be worth the investment.\nOverall, I'm feeling a bit stumped by these tight-fitting tiles, but I'm determined to find a solution. With a bit of creativity and perseverance, I'm confident that I can get the job done and have my network wiring completed in no time.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In other houses, I've been able to\n\nText continuation:\njust \"tap\" the tiles quickly upwards and their subsequent downward momentum caused them to fall into place. That kinda sorta works here, but it takes MANY taps and some just won't drop, and I'm afraid I'm going to break one.  \nI'm hoping there's some \"trick of the trade\" or life hack or whatever that someone knows which makes lowering such tiles back into place easy, or at least not this friggin' annoying. Thanks for your time.\n[deleted]: before putting them back up, I've shaved a bit off the edges of the tiles with a utility knife and drywall square.  That way you don't have to go through all of this if you need to take the tiles back down.\nThose ceilings are a bitch, aren't they?\nSQLDave: Brilliant. It never dawned on me to actually remove them. Are they that easy to shave without messing up? I assume the drywall square is to ensure they remain as square as possible?\n[deleted]: yes.  I would use a brand new blade and score the tile several times to cut through it (don't do it all at once)\nSQLDave: OK, so when you originally said \"shave\", my mind envisioned a \"scraping\" kind of action... but it looks like you're really suggesting an actual cut (even though I'll probably only be removing, like, 1/8\" - 1/4\").\n[deleted]: I would say so, even scraping would be ok but I think you would have a rough edge.  If you really wanted it, you could run it through a table saw with a fine blade, but scoring it with a sharp utility knife should work fine. \nYou won't see it and it will still stay up there because of the track, know what I mean?  \nTo get it out first, you can run a putty along the edge next to the track and pry the panel out of there.  That's what I've done.  If you break a tile you can always buy a new one if Lowes or Home Depot has a match.\nI hate these ceilings but sometimes there is no other choice\nIs that helpful?\nSQLDave: Very helpful. The ONLY bad part is these are harder than normal to get out with the insulation up there. &lt;sigh&gt;  Thanks again for the great ideas and followup.\n[deleted]: might end up popping out a couple more- like a lose one that is close by.  the track might have some give to it\nSQLDave: You have officially given me the courage to tackle this...now if I can just find the time :-)\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "&", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "You", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

It can be said (Collamarini) truly was a christian artist because in his churches and work, while he was inspired specially by medieval art, he has infused into his work a mystical and religious sentiment that modern art commonly has forgot.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The surrounding forest was also home to a variety of wildlife, including deer, turkeys, and even the occasional fox. Meyer's love for nature and his passion for herbology had created a unique and serene environment, which was reflected in the castle's architecture and design.\nToday, visitors can still explore the castle's grand halls, ornate staircases, and beautifully manicured gardens. The Italian steakhouse, Rivelli, offers a unique dining experience, with its elegant atmosphere and exquisite cuisine.

The story portrays it like college was out of the question because of money, but i know tons of people who who couldn't afford college so they took out loans. Also a poor girl with stellar grades from the ghetto would be a prime candidate for financial aid. Another story ran on NPR the other day about how poor high acheivers should always aim for the best schools they can because their chances of getting financial aid are very good, and their earnings potential after graduation will be much higher\n\nText continuation:\nIt's a valid point, and it's true that many students from low-income backgrounds have successfully navigated the college application process and secured financial aid to pursue their higher education goals. However, it's also important to consider the systemic barriers and biases that can prevent students like Melanie from even considering college as an option in the first place.\nFor example, research has shown that students from low-income backgrounds often lack access to resources and support systems that can help them navigate the college application process, such as guidance counselors, college preparatory courses, and test preparation materials. Additionally, the cost of applying to college can be prohibitively expensive, with some colleges charging application fees of $50 or more.\nFurthermore, even if Melanie had been aware of the financial aid options available to her, she may have faced skepticism or even outright discouragement from her teachers, counselors, or family members, who may have viewed college as an unrealistic goal for someone from her background. This can be particularly true in communities where there is a lack of representation and visibility of people who have successfully pursued higher education.\nMoreover, the story of Melanie and her classmates highlights the broader issue of educational inequality in the United States. Despite the fact that education is often touted as the key to social mobility, the reality is that students from low-income backgrounds often face significant barriers to accessing high-quality education, from crumbling school buildings and outdated textbooks to lack of access to Advanced Placement courses and extracurricular activities.\nIt's not just about individual students making individual choices, but rather about creating a system that is equitable and just, where every student has access to the resources and opportunities they need to succeed. This requires a commitment to addressing the root causes of educational inequality, from poverty and lack of access to healthcare to systemic racism and bias.\nUltimately, the story of Melanie and her classmates is a powerful reminder of the need for systemic change and a more just and equitable education system. By working to address the barriers and biases that prevent students like Melanie from accessing higher education, we can create a more just and equitable society where every student has the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or zip code.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "To", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

If a person knows what they want to do before college age, then go for it. Pour your heart and soul into your \"thing\" that you found to value so much, without the loans. But for the rest of us, we have the option to taking out the loans to expand our capabilities and maybe figure something else out what we want to do. There's always the option of not taking out loans when you don't have a \"thing\" but it will be more difficult to climb the economic ladder. That's almost assuming your goal is to climb the ladder, you are entirely entitled to not - you can stay exactly where you are or drop down a few rungs if you choose to not climb. \nOriginalStomper: &gt;Sometimes you have to take some risks.\nAgreed.  But the risks are disproportionately greater and more intimidating when you are a poor person of color with more chance the risk will not pay off and NO financial safety net.\nnotgod: If you're already poor and no way to pay it off - what is there to lose making an attempt? \nOriginalStomper: When you are poor with no credit, not paying your bills means getting evicted.  Not paying bills is serious.  The underprivileged know that the system works against them -- why should they believe they can take on debt with no adverse consequences?  How would they know?\nnotgod: Because then you're stuck in the same spot for the rest of your life. Pay the important bills, work with the billing company to get into a payment plan, get your shit turned off. Otherwise you're stuck. I'd rather try and fail then just spend my life doing the same thing. Read some biographies of people that have made it, they went for broke and succeeded by taking chances. Society wants you to keep paying your bills, fall in line, be average. If you're fine with that, good, if not, otherwise start making some changes and take some risks. Nobody is going to give you success. \nOriginalStomper: Stuck in the same spot struggling to pay rent and keep the utilities on is at least familiar for these people, and far less scary than being homeless.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "St", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "St", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The Earl's parties were conveyed by coach from Wentworth Woodhouse to the station to join these trains which were known, and shown in railway publications as \"E.F.W.

The M.S.& L.R. issued a 'Royal Standard' to the station to be flown when royalty was included in the party.\nThe station was also host to other trains\n\nText continuation:\n, including those carrying dignitaries and high-ranking officials. The station's unique history and significance were reflected in its architecture, with a distinctive clock tower and ornate waiting rooms. Over the years, the station played host to numerous events, including the annual St. Leger festival, which drew visitors from all over the country.\nAs the years went by, the station continued to serve the Earl's parties and other special trains, but its usage gradually declined. By the mid-20th century, the station was largely abandoned, and its once-grand buildings fell into disrepair. Despite this, the station's legacy lived on, and it remains a fascinating piece of railway history to this day.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Most of the divergences found in the litterature are used in the field of information theory to quantify the difference between two probability density functions, that is between positive data whose sum is equal to one. In such context, they take a simplified form that is not adapted to the problems considered here, in which the data fields are non-negative but with a sum not necessarily equal to one.

To this end, we will recall the methods allowing to build such divergences, and propose some\n\nText continuation:\n.\nIn particular, we will focus on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Hellinger distance, and the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which are commonly used in information theory. We will show how these divergences can be modified to be suitable for linear inverse problems, where the data fields are non-negative and do not necessarily sum up to one. We will also introduce new divergences that are specifically designed for these problems.\nThe proposed divergences will be tested on various linear inverse problems, such as image deblurring, tomography, and spectroscopy. We will demonstrate their effectiveness in quantifying the discrepancy between the observed data and the reconstructed images, and show how they can be used to improve the reconstruction algorithms.\nFurthermore, we will discuss the connection between the proposed divergences and other metrics used in linear inverse problems, such as the mean squared error and the peak signal-to-noise ratio. We will also explore the potential applications of the proposed divergences in other fields, such as machine learning and signal processing.\nThroughout the book, we will provide numerous examples and illustrations to help the reader understand the concepts and methods presented. We will also provide a comprehensive bibliography and a set of exercises to facilitate the learning process.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "#"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "We", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Most of the divergences found in the litterature are used in the field of information theory to quantify the difference between two probability density functions, that is between positive data whose sum is equal to one. In such context, they take a simplified form that is not adapted to the problems considered here, in which the data fields are non-negative but with a sum not necessarily equal to one. In a systematic way, we reconsider the classical divergences and we give their forms adapted to inverse problems. To this end, we will recall the methods allowing to build such divergences, and propose some\n\nText continuation:\ngeneralizations. The resolution of inverse problems implies systematically the minimisation of a divergence between physical measurements and a model depending of the unknown parameters. In the context image reconstruction, the model is generally linear and the constraints that must be taken into account are the non-negativity as well as (if necessary) the sum constraint of the unknown parameters. To take into account in a simple way the sum constraint, we introduce the class of scale invariant or affine invariant divergences. Such divergences remains unchanged when the model parameters are multiplied by a constant positive factor. We show the general properties of the invariance factors, and we give some interesting characteristics of such divergences.An extension of such divergences allows to obtain the property of invariance with respect to both the arguments of the divergences; this characteristic can be used to introduce the smoothness regularization of inverse problems, that is a regularisation in the sense of Tikhonov.We then develop in a last step, minimisation methods of the divergences subject to non-negativity and sum constraints on the solution components. These methods are founded on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions that must be fulfilled at the optimum. The Tikhonov regularization is considered in these methods.Chapter 11 associated with Appendix 9 deal with the application to the NMF, while Chapter 12 is dedicated to the Blind Deconvolution problem.In these two chapters, the interest of the scale invariant divergences is highlighted.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "#"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Last week, I think the election coverage just sapped any motivation I had left. It's been a really rough time lately. I've been unemployed for over a month and getting lots of interviews but no offers yet. Things with the girlfriend have been bad and it's really hurt my outlook. Money is tight and up until Saturday my roommate and I had been unsuccessfully looking for a new tenant. Well now the election is decided, we have a new roommate, I had two promising interviews today and several scheduled for this week, and my girlfriend and I are gonna try to heal things tonight. So I forced myself to go outside and do some shit, although I admit it wasn't fucking easy to take that first\n\nText continuation:\nstep.\nI walked out the door, feeling the crisp autumn air hit my face, and immediately regretted not wearing a jacket. The sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the neighborhood, but I barely noticed. My mind was elsewhere, replaying all the negative thoughts and worries that had been plaguing me for weeks. I had to shake them off, though. I had to focus on the present moment and what I could control.\nAs I started my warm-up, my legs felt like lead and my lungs burned from lack of use. It was like my body was screaming at me to stop, to give up and go back to the comfort of my couch. But I pushed through the discomfort, gradually increasing my pace and intensity. The sweat started dripping down my face, and my muscles began to ache, but I kept going.\nThe first few reps of my workout were a struggle, but as I got into a rhythm, I started to feel a sense of accomplishment. I was doing it. I was taking control of my life, one rep at a time. The stress and anxiety that had been weighing me down started to lift, replaced by a sense of empowerment.\nAs I finished my workout and walked back into my apartment, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had faced my demons and come out on top. I knew that tomorrow would bring new challenges, but I was ready. I was ready to tackle whatever life threw my way, one rep at a time.\nAnd as I sat down to write this, I realized that maybe, just maybe, this little workout was more than just a physical exercise. Maybe it was a metaphor for life. Maybe it was a reminder that no matter how tough things get, we always have the power to take control, to push through the pain and come out stronger on the other side.\nI know that I still have a long way to go. I still have to face the uncertainty of my job search and the challenges of my relationship. But for now, I'm taking things one rep at a time. I'm taking control of my life, one workout at a time. And who knows, maybe someday I'll look back on this tough time and realize that it was the catalyst for something greater. Maybe someday I'll look back and say, \"You know what? That was the best thing that ever happened to me.\"\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

So I forced myself to go outside and do some shit, although I admit it wasn't fucking easy to take that first\n\nText continuation:\nstep. \n&amp;#x200B;\nI started by doing a bridge hold and trying to push my stomach as high in the air as possible. I'm not particularly flexible and my bridge kind of sucks, so I think it's important to keep stretching those muscles to get that synovial fluid in there. Followed up with a few L-Holds, and I was surprised to discover that I can actually hold my legs out almost straight with my butt almost completely off the ground for a couple seconds before collapsing. Couldn't even get my butt off the ground at all a few months ago. I rounded out the stretches with some twist holds and amazingly I can actually lock my hands behind my back on my right side. Left side is still pretty tight but I'm seeing slow progress with a hand towel. \n&amp;#x200B;\nOn to pushups. I started with just a few conventional pushups to get the blood circulating, and then a few close pushups. I migrated to one of the beer die tables in the backyard and did a few one-arm incline pushups with legs apart at first, then together. Legs together is so much fucking harder it's not even funny, even with such a steep incline. I can feel my feet slipping from underneath me. I'm trying so hard to not rotate my torso when coming back up, and I'm trying to avoid splaying my elbows. Left arm is having a hell of a time keeping up with the right. I transitioned to the ground for some slow and steady close pushups. I've stopped counting and recording reps like I used to, I just go until it hurts but before failure. \n&amp;#x200B;\nNext were leg raises. Started out on the ground with straight legs, and the next set I moved to the bar. Hanging leg raises are a lot harder for me because I feel more of a strain in my quads, and I tend to swing a little. I tried keeping my core flexed and tight the whole time to avoid swinging, but at this point I feel like I can get my muscles burning more on my back because my stamina is so much less while hanging. \n&amp;#x200B;\nFinally, grip training. Started with some clenched eagle claws, then 2 sets of 5 fingertip pushups to work the tops of the fingers. I did a few hangs from the bar to warm up, and then started some towel hangs. Jesus, is my endurance lower with the towel, and it's not even a thick one. But if I can get up to 30 seconds with the towel I'll be pretty happy with that, as I can do about a minute on the bar. \n&amp;#x200B;\nThat was it for the day. I went in, made my 1 giant meal for the day, started my fasting timer, and I'll try to hop on the stationary bike later tonight. Just thought I'd share this momentous day of getting off my ass and doing the right thing for a change. I'll keep going this whole week and stop being a lazy fuck. Thank you to this sub for keeping me mostly motivated throughout these many months. Cheers.\n5sav1age9: A week off can actually be really good for you and just what you need.

Are you in high school or college and has he shown any interest in you?\nVenUs\n\nText continuation:\n_buddy809: Yeah, we're in high school and I've noticed he's been looking at me a few times, but I don't know if it's just friendly or something more. I'm really nervous about approaching him because I don't want to come across as creepy or desperate.\nIt's funny, because when I'm around him, I feel like I can be myself, but at the same time, I'm terrified of ruining the dynamic we have. I don't want to make him uncomfortable or make him feel like he's being hit on.\nI've been thinking about trying to find common ground, like a shared interest or something, to break the ice. But at the same time, I don't want to overthink it and come across as too eager.\nHas anyone else ever been in a situation like this? How did you handle it?\nPenguinJockey17: I think you're overthinking it, to be honest. People are often more open to getting to know someone than we think they are. Just be yourself, be respectful, and see where it goes. If he's not interested, then that's okay. You'll learn from the experience and move on.\nThat being said, it's good that you're considering his feelings and not wanting to make him uncomfortable. That shows you're thinking about him as a person, not just as a potential partner.\nIf you do decide to talk to him, try to find a quiet spot where you can have a conversation without distractions. And don't be afraid to ask him questions about himself - people love talking about themselves, and it's a great way to build a connection.\nAlso, don't put too much pressure on the situation. Just enjoy the conversation and see where it takes you. And if it doesn't work out, then that's okay too. You'll learn to navigate these kinds of situations and become more confident in your ability to connect with others.\nAs for me, I've never been in a situation like this, but I have had to navigate awkward social situations before. And you know what? It's often the things that make us uncomfortable that can lead to the most rewarding experiences.\nSo, take a deep breath, be yourself, and see what happens. Good luck!\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Although it's a bit weird but we look at each other quite often. Like eye contact. This has happened a lot of time in the past weeks.

He never spoke to me and I never did too. And I know, that's why I'm even more hesitant to speak to him. Even tho his friends seems nice\nPenguinJockey17: Oh, okay. That changes things a lot. Have you talked to him at all?\nVenUs_buddy809: Nope at least not yet \ud83d\ude05 I made this post to get some advices on how to approach him\nPenguinJockey17: Cold approach. A girl I used to have a crush on used to be my best friend, we got along great and hung out and talked a lot but I never picked up on any of the (frankly blunt as fuck) hints she was dropping\nVenUs_buddy809: I don't understand, you suggest me to do a cold approach?\nPenguinJockey17: Look, you\u2019ve got two options. Option A is try to become friends with him to try to get to know him a little better, then ask him out if you think he\u2019s a good match (just FYI it never worked out in my favor but that\u2019s most likely just a me issue). Option B is skipping that and straight up asking him out\nVenUs_buddy809: I don't want to ask him out \ud83d\ude2d just want to be friends lol\nPenguinJockey17: Oh, I\u2019ve been reading this the wrong way. If you just want to be friends you could either be friends with his friends and get introduced or, again, cold approach. Just ask if he\u2019d want to hang out or talk or something\nVenUs_buddy809: Yeah I think I'm gonna do the cold approach \ud83d\ude29 I only know two of his friends and one of them is not in school rn.

Cluster bombs are usually air-dropped shells that eject multiple small bomblets to kill enemy soldiers. A document released by Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs says the countries agreed never to use cluster munitions or the explosive bomblets they contain. The countries also agreed never to develop, acquire, retain or transfer cluster munitions. Countries attending the 11-day conference agreed to the treaty Wednesday but formally signed it Friday. The accord calls for a total, immediate ban of the weapons, strong standards to protect those injured by them, contaminated areas to be cleaned up as quickly as possible and for the weapons to be immediately destroyed, he said. Thomas Nash, coordinator of the CMC campaigning organization, said Wednesday: \"This is a great achievement for everyone who has been working hard to see the end of 40 years of suffering from these weapons.\" Though some of the biggest makers of cluster bombs, including the United States, Russia, China and Israel, were not involved in the talks and have not signed the accord, organizers predicted that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance. \"Take the United States,\" Nash said. \"Almost all of its allies are here. They've decided to ban these weapons. That's going to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to ever use these weapons again, either on its own or in joint operations.\" The agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years, he said. Cluster munitions, which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets, are what the International Committee of the Red Cross calls a \"persistent humanitarian problem.\" Most of a cluster bomb's bomblets are meant to explode on impact, but many do not. Estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time, the Red Cross says. That means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area, often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians. Last week, Acting Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Stephen D. Mull called it \"an absolute moral obligation\" to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle. But he also predicted that the United States would not agree to any ban. \"We think that it is going to be impossible to ban cluster munitions... because these are weapons that have a certain military utility and are of use,\" Mull said. \"The United States relies on them as an important part of our own defense strategy.\" Instead, he urged that the weapons be regulated \"to take humanitarian considerations into account\" and that \"technological fixes\" be pursued that would render them harmless after a battle. During the 34-day war in Lebanon in 2006, the United Nations estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets, 1 million of which may not have exploded, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. More than 250 civilians and bomb-disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern Lebanon since the war ended. Cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in Kosovo. Lt. Col. Jim Burke, a military adviser to the Irish Defense Forces said they quickly became a major killer of civilians. In more than 20 countries, according to the ICRC, cluster bombs have created lasting \"no-go\" areas, rendering them as dangerous as minefields. Laos is the most affected country. Millions of bomblets dropped during the Vietnam War continue to kill civilians more than three decades later. Still, militaries consider cluster bombs important for use against multiple targets dispersed over a wide area, such as tanks or military personnel moving across the landscape. A single bomb containing hundreds of submunitions can cover more than 18 square miles. CNN's Jacqueline Clyne contributed to this report.\n\nSummary:\nMore than 100 countries adopt treaty to ban cluster bombs, which often harm civilians long after conflicts end.\nThe treaty bans the use, development, and transfer of cluster munitions and their explosive bomblets.\nCountries agree to destroy stockpiles within eight years and clean up contaminated areas quickly.\nThe agreement aims to end 40 years of suffering from these unreliable and inaccurate weapons.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

For example, it can be used to decompose matrices and tensors, which is important in many applications such as image and video processing, natural language processing and data mining.

Under this formulation, the problem finds its roots in invariant theory where the decompositions are known as canonical forms. In this context many different algorithms were proposed. We introduce a superfast\n\nText continuation:\nalgorithm that improves the previous approaches with results from structured linear algebra. It achieves a softly linear arithmetic complexity bound. To the best of our knowledge, the previously known algorithms have at least quadratic complexity bounds. Our algorithm computes a symbolic decomposition in $O(M(D) log(D))$ arithmetic operations, where $M(D)$ is the complexity of multiplying two polynomials of degree D. It is deterministic when the decomposition is unique. When the decomposition is not unique, our algorithm is randomized. We present a Monte Carlo version of it and we show how to modify it to a Las Vegas one, within the same complexity. From the symbolic decomposition, we approximate the terms of the decomposition with an error of $2^{--$\\epsilon$}$ , in $O(D log^2(D) (log^2(D) + log($\\epsilon$)))$ arithmetic operations. We use results from Kaltofen and Yagati (1989) to bound the size of the representation of the coefficients involved in the decomposition and we bound the algebraic degree of the problem by min(rank, D -- rank + 1). We show that this bound can be tight. When the input polynomial has integer coefficients, our algorithm performs, up to poly-logarithmic factors, $O\\_{bit} (D{\\ell} + D^4 + D^3 $\\tau$)$ bit operations, where $$\\tau$$ is the maximum bitsize of the coefficients and $2^{--{\\ell}}$ is the relative error of the terms in the decomposition.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "$\\", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "${", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

For me, girlfriends are a subsection of friends, meaning if finding friends is hard, then finding a girlfriend will be even harder. I\u2019ve met people who were great friends but terrible as SOs. I\u2019ve never met anyone who was a great SO but a bad friend.\nI do believe that if you meet a friend who cares about you, then you\u2019ll feel a lot happier and readier to look for a girlfriend.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The rallies, which draw mostly teens, are one part concert, one part Christian revival. \"I had to stop listening to them for a while,\" said Hutchins, who lives in Cumming, Georgia, and plays the piano, guitar and harmonica. He said the group's world view \"had a negative effect on me,\" and made him irritable and angry. \"God owns my life, not the Beatles,\" he said simply. Although Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music -- from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United -- he said he has to be careful of what music he listens to, for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles. Hutchins, a 16-year-old graced with poise and thoughtfulness, is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture, with its ubiquitous references to sex, drugs and violence, has harmed him. Last year, Hutchins and his Christian youth group attended an Acquire the Fire rally in Atlanta, Georgia, he said. Acquire the Fire -- regional rallies held across the country -- and BattleCry -- the larger rallies held this year in only three cities -- are the products of the evangelical Christian organization Teen Mania.  Go behind-the-scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a BattleCry event \u00bb . One part concert, one part Christian revival, the rallies seek to \"stage a reverse revolution\" against secular popular culture. They have the pull of headlining rock concerts, drawing thousands of people regardless of the region of the country, the month of year or the day of the week. The audiences are nearly always predominantly teenagers and young adults. From 2006 to 2007, a total of 127,830 people attended the 34 Acquire the Fire rallies, and 71,414 people attended the three BattleCry events held in San Francisco, California; Detroit, Michigan; and Bristow, Virginia, according to Teen Mania. Watch flags, fireworks and teens at rally . For Hutchins, who said he struggled in his early adolescence to fit in and be cool before having a personal experience with God about four years ago, the organization's message is exactly right. \"We don't have to be branded by the culture, we are branded by God,\" he said. \"Be who God created you to be.\" But the glossy, glamorous appeal of popular culture too often obscures that path to God, Teen Mania followers say. And so, Ron Luce, the 46-year-old founder of the organization, has waged a modern-day crusade against \"purveyors of popular culture,\" whom he has condemned as \"the enemy.\" More than two decades old, Teen Mania estimates it has reached more than 2 million teens with its message \"of living completely for Christ.\" The organization is sprawling. In addition to its live stadium rallies, there are BattleCry shirts and hats, mobile screen savers, books and a television program. There are international mission trips -- Hutchins attended one in Tijuana, Mexico, this summer. There is even a Teen Mania internship, a one-year program called the Honor Academy, based in Lindale, Texas. In the live events, Luce couples the earnest appeal of a young father with a preacher's ability to mobilize a crowd. He weaves disturbing statistics about teenagers amid his gospel. Today's teenagers are in crisis, he says. \"We're fighting for those who don't know they have a voice, that are being manipulated by our pop culture indulging in things that, really, they're not mature enough to be thinking about yet,\" Luce told CNN. \"Kids are hurting,\" he said. And of those who he feels inflict these moral wounds, Luce said, \"We call them terrorists, virtue terrorists, that are destroying our kids.\" \"They're raping virgin teenage America on the sidewalk, and everybody's walking by and acting like everything's OK. And it's just not OK.\" To some, Luce's rhetoric is off-putting, hateful and divisive. Opponents point to his views on homosexuality -- not \"in God's plan\" -- and abortion -- the \"ending of a precious life\" -- and say Luce is imposing conservative values on vulnerable teenagers. Explore Americans' views on religion . It is this criticism that Luce and his followers confronted head-on in March at BattleCry San Francisco. There, in arguably the most liberal city in the United States, protesters, armed with megaphones and poster board signs, rallied against BattleCry on the steps of City Hall as the Christian teenagers circled and prayed in a demonstration of their own. \"Ron Luce is a liar!\" one protester shouted. \"Let me hear you say Christian fascist,\" another yelled. Luce and the youths, some as young as 11, also raised their voices. \"God, I ask that as we do this BattleCry, Lord, that you would reveal yourself to the teenagers, God, here, God,\" Mindy Peterson, shouted. Peterson is a member of Teen Mania's Honor Academy. Afterward, Peterson railed against what she said was the protesters' mischaracterization of BattleCry. \"These people think that our war is against other people. They think that our war is against man. And our war isn't. Our war's against ... the pain in teenagers' hearts, like depression, alcoholism. Those things that -- that are, like, tearing our teenagers apart,\" she said. While much milder in his terms, Hutchins agrees. \"We're a generation that is kind of troubled,\" he said. Luce wants to \"rescue the hearts of our generation,\" he added. And of the critics' contention that the rallies, the organization, the message is neo-conservatism wrapped in Biblical verse? Hutchins smiles, nods patiently. \"I don't go because I have a political agenda,\" he said, adding that his friends don't, either. \"Mostly, what we're concerned with is Jesus.\" E-mail to a friend .

The rallies, which draw mostly teens, are one part concert, one part Christian revival. \"I had to stop listening to them for a while,\" said Hutchins, who lives in Cumming, Georgia, and plays the piano, guitar and harmonica. He said the group's world view \"had a negative effect on me,\" and made him irritable and angry. \"God owns my life, not the Beatles,\" he said simply. Although Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music -- from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United -- he said he has to be careful of what music he listens to, for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles. Hutchins, a 16-year-old graced with poise and thoughtfulness, is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture, with its ubiquitous references to sex, drugs and violence, has harmed him. Last year, Hutchins and his Christian youth group attended an Acquire the Fire rally in Atlanta, Georgia, he said. Acquire the Fire -- regional rallies held across the country -- and BattleCry -- the larger rallies held this year in only three cities -- are the products of the evangelical Christian organization Teen Mania.  Go behind-the-scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a BattleCry event \u00bb . One part concert, one part Christian revival, the rallies seek to \"stage a reverse revolution\" against secular popular culture. They have the pull of headlining rock concerts, drawing thousands of people regardless of the region of the country, the month of year or the day of the week. The audiences are nearly always predominantly teenagers and young adults. From 2006 to 2007, a total of 127,830 people attended the 34 Acquire the Fire rallies, and 71,414 people attended the three BattleCry events held in San Francisco, California; Detroit, Michigan; and Bristow, Virginia, according to Teen Mania. Watch flags, fireworks and teens at rally . For Hutchins, who said he struggled in his early adolescence to fit in and be cool before having a personal experience with God about four years ago, the organization's message is exactly right. \"We don't have to be branded by the culture, we are branded by God,\" he said. \"Be who God created you to be.\" But the glossy, glamorous appeal of popular culture too often obscures that path to God, Teen Mania followers say. And so, Ron Luce, the 46-year-old founder of the organization, has waged a modern-day crusade against \"purveyors of popular culture,\" whom he has condemned as \"the enemy.\" More than two decades old, Teen Mania estimates it has reached more than 2 million teens with its message \"of living completely for Christ.\" The organization is sprawling. In addition to its live stadium rallies, there are BattleCry shirts and hats, mobile screen savers, books and a television program. There are international mission trips -- Hutchins attended one in Tijuana, Mexico, this summer.

But she wasn't looking for the perfect safari lodge. She was hunting for the right cosmetic surgeon. When she told her family, it wasn't an easy sell. \"South Africa? You're going to get some kind of witch doctor,\" she recalls her father saying. \"But I told him they perfected some of the first heart surgeries down there. To me, South Africa had the most reputable surgeons.\" Hiltbrunner, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, traveled to Johannesburg in 2004 for a face-lift, upper arm lift and eyelid surgery. And she and her husband -- who hadn't taken a vacation in 20 years -- went on a luxury safari, included in the package by medical-travel agency Surgeon and Safari. \"Medical tourism\" may sound strange, but patients are discovering they can get some cosmetic surgeries abroad for less than the U.S. price. And many surgeries include sightseeing packages. The roster of countries in which hospitals and surgeons are marketing their services to foreigners is growing. South Africa, Argentina, Thailand, Brazil, Costa Rica, India and Singapore have become major players. Robert Painter, a travel writer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, journeyed last year to Argentina for dental surgeries -- and tango lessons: \"If I'm going to be stuck somewhere for two weeks at a time, twice, Buenos Aires has got to be the best possible place,\" he says . Painter's procedures were organized by Plenitas, a medical-travel facilitator in Buenos Aires, which booked him at a hotel with a dance studio in the back. He wasn't the only guest getting surgery: \"While I was there, there was a young lady who was also having implants -- though not of the dental type.\" Cost-cutting pros and cons . Cosmetic, or elective, procedures aren't covered by insurance, so cost remains the motivating factor for most medical tourists. Surgeries in many countries cost half or even one-fifth what they would in the U.S. -- including airfare, hotel and excursions. \"A full face-lift that would cost $20,000 in the U.S. runs about $1,250 in South Africa,\" a 2005 article in U-Daily, the University of Delaware's online news service noted. Faith Richter, of Hope Sound, Florida, got a face-lift in Bangkok, Thailand. Her trip was organized by New York City's Med Journeys. \"In the U.S., it would have cost $20,000 for the procedure alone, with no time in the hospital,\" she says. In Bangkok, Richter was in the hospital four days, and the total cost of her 19-day trip, including sightseeing and airfare for two, was $10,600. Painter estimates he saved $18,000 on his surgeries. \"Cost was the primary factor,\" he says. \"The only factor.\" Medical costs abroad are less than in the U.S. for many reasons -- favorable exchange rates, lower salaries and fewer medical lawsuits, which means lower malpractice-insurance costs. But the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery warns against low-cost surgery. \"Get bargains on your shoes and laundry detergent, not on your face,\" says spokesman Tony Staffieri. \"Researching the quality of doctors should be a patient's primary consideration, but it isn't always,\" he says. \"Some people think 'tummy tuck and shopping.' This is not makeup; it's somebody cutting you.\" Some medical professionals fear that patients will overlook the severity of invasive surgeries and fail to ask the right questions. More casual attitudes toward plastic surgery -- spurred by lunch-break Botox treatments and same-day liposuctions, paired with temptingly cheap alternatives and vacation packages -- increase the risk of bad outcomes.

But she wasn't looking for the perfect safari lodge. She was hunting for the right cosmetic surgeon. When she told her family, it wasn't an easy sell. \"South Africa? You're going to get some kind of witch doctor,\" she recalls her father saying. \"But I told him they perfected some of the first heart surgeries down there. To me, South Africa had the most reputable surgeons.\" Hiltbrunner, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, traveled to Johannesburg in 2004 for a face-lift, upper arm lift and eyelid surgery. And she and her husband -- who hadn't taken a vacation in 20 years -- went on a luxury safari, included in the package by medical-travel agency Surgeon and Safari. \"Medical tourism\" may sound strange, but patients are discovering they can get some cosmetic surgeries abroad for less than the U.S. price. And many surgeries include sightseeing packages. The roster of countries in which hospitals and surgeons are marketing their services to foreigners is growing. South Africa, Argentina, Thailand, Brazil, Costa Rica, India and Singapore have become major players. Robert Painter, a travel writer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, journeyed last year to Argentina for dental surgeries -- and tango lessons: \"If I'm going to be stuck somewhere for two weeks at a time, twice, Buenos Aires has got to be the best possible place,\" he says . Painter's procedures were organized by Plenitas, a medical-travel facilitator in Buenos Aires, which booked him at a hotel with a dance studio in the back. He wasn't the only guest getting surgery: \"While I was there, there was a young lady who was also having implants -- though not of the dental type.\" Cost-cutting pros and cons . Cosmetic, or elective, procedures aren't covered by insurance, so cost remains the motivating factor for most medical tourists. Surgeries in many countries cost half or even one-fifth what they would in the U.S. -- including airfare, hotel and excursions. \"A full face-lift that would cost $20,000 in the U.S. runs about $1,250 in South Africa,\" a 2005 article in U-Daily, the University of Delaware's online news service noted. Faith Richter, of Hope Sound, Florida, got a face-lift in Bangkok, Thailand. Her trip was organized by New York City's Med Journeys. \"In the U.S., it would have cost $20,000 for the procedure alone, with no time in the hospital,\" she says. In Bangkok, Richter was in the hospital four days, and the total cost of her 19-day trip, including sightseeing and airfare for two, was $10,600. Painter estimates he saved $18,000 on his surgeries. \"Cost was the primary factor,\" he says. \"The only factor.\" Medical costs abroad are less than in the U.S. for many reasons -- favorable exchange rates, lower salaries and fewer medical lawsuits, which means lower malpractice-insurance costs. But the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery warns against low-cost surgery. \"Get bargains on your shoes and laundry detergent, not on your face,\" says spokesman Tony Staffieri. \"Researching the quality of doctors should be a patient's primary consideration, but it isn't always,\" he says. \"Some people think 'tummy tuck and shopping.' This is not makeup; it's somebody cutting you.\" Some medical professionals fear that patients will overlook the severity of invasive surgeries and fail to ask the right questions. More casual attitudes toward plastic surgery -- spurred by lunch-break Botox treatments and same-day liposuctions, paired with temptingly cheap alternatives and vacation packages -- increase the risk of bad outcomes. Even stateside, cosmetic surgery can have tragic results. \"First Wives Club\" author Olivia Goldsmith died during a chin-tuck in 2004, and this year Kanye West's mother, Donda, died after a tummy tuck and breast reduction.

I don't want to lose anything.\nUser 1: I hate computers. Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth.\nUser 2: What are we going to do now?\nUser 1: I don't know. I feel like going out.\nUser 2: I wonder how much of the city is down.\nUser 1: It doesn't matter. I still can go out and buy a beer.\nUser 2: Maybe. But if there\n\nText continuation:\n's a blackout, probably the pubs are closed. And besides, I know you have a political science exam tomorrow. I thought you had a lot of reading to do.\nUser 1: Yes, that's true. Damn! I just lost half my paper, and now I can't even do my homework. This is a bad time for this to happen.\nUser 2: I have a flashlight in my closet. If you want to use that to read, you can.\nUser 1: Thanks. I think I will try. Where are you going?\nUser 2: I like your idea of getting a beer. I think I'll go out myself.\nUser 1: Maybe we can trade. Why don't you stay here and read for my exam, and I'll go drink beer?\nUser 2: No, it just won't work. If I read for your exam, you won't know the answers tomorrow. I will.\nUser 1: So? You can go to the class for me. Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam. Why not?\nUser 2: How many students are in the class?\nUser 1: About fourteen.\nUser 2: So it won't work, old buddy. They'll see that I'm not you.

Although there are many styles of motorcycles, they are loosely organized into 6 main categories.  These categories most closely align to the intended use of the vehicle.  There is your standard motorcycle, your more relaxed cruising motorcycle, the larger capacity and longer haul touring cycle, a racing more sportier sports cycle and then you have a off-road motorcycle often known as a dirtbike and lastly a dual-sport which is a motorcycle that can go both on and offroad.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The book consists of seventy-five folios, twenty-two of which remain blank.\nIt was made for Sir Sea\u00e1n mac Oliver Bourke, 17th Mac William \u00cdochtar (d. 1580) of Mayo from 1571 to 1580. Believed to have been the product of his patronage, its production appears to have ceased upon his death, except for a few additions in 1584.\n\"It is, as far as we know, the last of the great family books written in Irish, but its text has remained rather bleak, the poems that were probably intended to fill the blank pages never having been copied\".\nThe text is of two\n\nText continuation:\nmain parts: the first part is a history of the de Burgo family, tracing their lineage back to the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century, and the second part is a collection of genealogical information about the family's members. The manuscript is written in Irish, with some Latin and English phrases scattered throughout. The text is accompanied by elaborate illustrations, including coats of arms, family crests, and other heraldic devices.\nDespite its historical significance, the Book of the de Burgos has not been widely studied or translated. This is likely due to the fact that the text is written in Irish, which is a language that is not widely spoken today. Additionally, the manuscript is written in a style that is difficult to decipher, with many of the words and phrases being written in a form of Irish that is no longer used. Nevertheless, the Book of the de Burgos remains an important artifact of Irish history and culture, and it continues to be studied by scholars and enthusiasts of the language and history of Ireland.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

What distinguishes the Book of the de Burgos from other late medieval Irish manuscripts is its visual style, with large pictures which are \"extremely crude and brutal in colour, but arresting by their originality and their vehemence. Movements are awkward but convincing... skies are red or yellow, dogs are green, there is a constant disproportion of the figures, but a sort of brutal integrity emanates from these images... gaudy and violently realistic.\"There are four scenes of the Passion, nine family portraits and a page on their coat of arms. Two poems inserted at the end of the book are praise-poems written by Tadhg Dall \u00d3 hUiginn and Ruaidhr\u00ed mac Domhnall \u00d3 hUiginn, for Sir Sea\u00e1n Bourke. The book ends with two legal deeds in Latin, dated 1584, between Walter Ciotach Burke (son of Sea\u00e1n) and the Barretts, who laid claim to possession of Belleek Castle. There are later comments in English in a later hand from the original scribe - \"Olyverus Bourke mac Sheamus died the last daye of December Annno Dom. 1619 in his house at Inisquoe.\"\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "O", "answer_neg": "\"No"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The song premiered at the 1965 edition of Un disco per l'estate.\nThe single peaked at first place  for four weeks between July and October 1965 on the Italian hit parade. It was the most successful song of Fontana.\nThe song was adapted in English by Robert Mellin with the title \"My World\", and recorded by The Ray Charles Singers, The Bachelors and Engelbert Humperdinck.\nA French version titled \"Un monde fait pour nous\" was recorded by Herv\u00e9 Vilard and by Richard Anthony. Fontana himself took a Spanish version, titled \"El Mundo\", to the top of the Spanish charts in 1965. The Spanish version was also covered by popular\n\nText continuation:\nartists such as Julio Iglesias, Raphael and Joan Baptista.

Arrangements were from Ennio Morricone. The song premiered at the 1965 edition of Un disco per l'estate.\nThe single peaked at first place  for four weeks between July and October 1965 on the Italian hit parade. It was the most successful song of Fontana.\nThe song was adapted in English by Robert Mellin with the title \"My World\", and recorded by The Ray Charles Singers, The Bachelors and Engelbert Humperdinck.\nA French version titled \"Un monde fait pour nous\" was recorded by Herv\u00e9 Vilard and by Richard Anthony. Fontana himself took a Spanish version, titled \"El Mundo\", to the top of the Spanish charts in 1965. The Spanish version was also covered by popular\n\nText continuation:\nCuban singer Roberto Faz and Mexican singer Javier Solis.\nThe song was later covered by several artists including Gianni Morandi, Milva, Il Volo, Patrizio Buanne, Ornella Vanoni, Claudio Baglioni, Gianna Nannini, Franco Simone, Karel Gott, Dyango, Al Bano, Punkreas & Piotta.\nIn 2011, Sergio Dalma included a version of the song on Via Dalma II, his second collection of Italian songs performed in Spanish. Issued as the first single from the disc, \"El Mundo\" rose to No. 10 on the official chart released by Productores de M\u00fasica de Espa\u00f1a. The song also achieved success in Latin America, particularly Argentina, thanks to its inclusion in the soap opera (telenovela) Dulce Amor.\n\"Il Mondo\" was also used in several films, including Richard Curtis' About Time and Philippe Le Guay's Bicycling with Moli\u00e8re  and the opening title sequence of the Italian television miniseries Il miracolo.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "M", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "H", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Although the plant response to environmental stresses is characterized by both architectural and functional plasticity, recent attempts to integrate biological knowledge into genetics models have mainly concerned specific physiological processes or crop models without architecture, and thus may prove limited when studying genotype x environment interactions. Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study introducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives access to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection and thus to promising tools for yield optimization\n\nText continuation:\n.\nBy incorporating genetics into the functional-structural growth model, we can better understand the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and ultimately yield. This approach allows us to simulate the behavior of different genotypes under various environmental conditions, enabling the prediction of phenotypic traits and the identification of QTL associated with these traits. The integration of genetics and functional-structural growth modeling also provides a framework for understanding how genetic variation affects plant architecture and function, which is essential for optimizing crop yields.\nThe functional-structural growth model used in this study is based on the concept of functional-structural plant modeling, which combines detailed descriptions of plant architecture and function with simulations of environmental conditions. This approach allows us to simulate the behavior of plants at the individual organ level, taking into account factors such as light, temperature, and water availability. The inclusion of genetics in this model enables us to simulate the effects of genetic variation on plant development and yield, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.\nThe simulation study presented in this paper demonstrates the potential of integrating genetics and functional-structural growth modeling to predict phenotypic traits and identify QTL associated with these traits. The results show that the genetic component of the model can accurately predict the behavior of different genotypes under various environmental conditions, and that the integration of genetics and functional-structural growth modeling can provide valuable insights into the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and yield. These findings have important implications for the development of breeding strategies and the optimization of crop yields, and highlight the potential of this approach for improving our understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect plant development and yield.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study introducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives access to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection and thus to promising tools for yield optimization\n\nText continuation:\n. Methods: The GreenLab model was selected as a reasonable choice to link growth model parameters to QTL. Virtual genes and virtual chromosomes were defined to build a simple genetic model that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model. The QTL Cartographer software was used to study QTL detection of simulated plant traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotype for yield maximization based on the model parameters and the associated allelic combination. Key Results and Conclusions: By keeping the environmental factors constant and using a virtual population with a large number of individuals generated by a Mendelian genetic model, results for an ideal case could be simulated. Virtual QTL detection was compared in the case of phenotypic traits - such as cob weight - and when traits were model parameters, and was found to be more accurate in the latter case. The practical interest of this approach is illustrated by calculating the parameters (and the corresponding genotype) associated with yield optimization of a GreenLab maize model. The paper discusses the potentials of GreenLab to represent environment x genotype interactions, in particular through its main state variable, the ratio of biomass supply over demand.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Ex: /u/&lt;username&gt;.\n/u/vaughannt asked: \n&gt;I'm trying to work up to the arch hold. Currently just doing the leg lift portion for 30 seconds. Should I be feeling muscle activation in my core? It seems like I only feel it in my legs. I was feeling it in my lower back momentarily but I think I've corrected that. Anyone have tips?\nstickysweetastytreat: u/vaughannt\nYeah feeling it in your legs is fine, like along your butt &amp; backs of your thighs. For low back, there are two ways you can do it-- by moving your low back with it, or not. If you want to keep it out of your low back, then tuck your tailbone while you lift your legs solely with your butt + legs. Don't expect to lift your legs very high this way, but you do put more work on your butt/legs. Instead of thinking \"tuck your tailbone\", you could also think of it like trying to draw your navel up away from the floor while you lift your legs.\nIf your low back isn't irritated by it, there's no inherent harm in moving with your low back. You could even try both ways!\nvaughannt: Awesome, thank you for the reply!\nstickysweetastytreat: Yw, good luck!\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "**"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Both", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Y", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Both", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In Sierra County, Proctor worked as a lawyer and as the assessor of Sierra County. In 1858, he moved with a group of four members from Downieville to Eagle Valley in the area that is now known as Nevada. When they arrived, three members of the group, Curry, Musser, and Proctor, bought the Eagle Ranch for $1,000 and a down payment of $300. The ranch was situated on the current location of Carson City and thus the group founded Carson City with Proctor as a co-founder. In 1864, he claimed to have named the city, but Abraham Curry is generally given credit for that. Proctor owned one\n\nText continuation:\nof the original 15 lots in the town, which he sold for $1,000 in 1861. He later returned to Carson City in 1869 and served as a state senator from 1871 to 1875.\nDuring his time in the Nevada State Senate, Proctor was a strong advocate for the development of the state's infrastructure, particularly in the areas of transportation and education. He was a key figure in the passage of the Nevada State Constitution in 1864 and played a crucial role in the establishment of the University of Nevada in 1874. Proctor's commitment to public service and his leadership abilities earned him widespread respect and admiration from his contemporaries. After leaving the state senate, Proctor continued to practice law in Carson City and remained an active member of the community until his death in 1892. Despite his significant contributions to the founding and development of Carson City, Proctor's legacy has often been overshadowed by that of Abraham Curry, who is more widely recognized as the city's founder. However, Proctor's achievements and accomplishments as a co-founder, state senator, and lawyer have not been forgotten, and he remains an important figure in the history of Nevada.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Respond", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "P", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Proctor owned one\n\nText continuation:\n-third of the Eagle Ranch, but gave half of it to Benjamin F. Green, who was the fourth member of the group. In 1859, Proctor was vice-president of a constitutional convention, that had as objective to create Nevada Territory. During the convention, Proctor represented Humboldt County. After Nevada became a territory, he filed his candidacy to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the territory, but he lost.\nProctor was a member of the 1864 Nevada Constitutional Convention, that started on July 4 and produced an approved constitution. He was elected member with 118 votes. Proctor was one of the two members representing Nye County and he was the only Democrat at the Convention; all others were Unionists. Records from the Convention stated that Proctor was married. He was elected senator of Nye County in the Nevada Senate on November 8, 1864, and his term began the following day. He served in three regular sessions and one special session. In the first and second regular session, he was the only Democratic member of the Nevada Senate. Proctor advocated states' rights and legislation to extend suffrage to women and to make it possible for women to hold public office. His term ended in 1868 and he was succeeded by Robert Mullen. During the 1860s or 1870s, he moved to another state and he died in 1892. East and West Proctor Street in Carson City were named after Proctor and in 1995 he was inducted by a senate resolution into the Senate Hall of Fame of Nevada.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "In", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "H", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

complications.\nThis was despite most respondents having experience of treating a child with an eating disorder.\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics said it was working to improve training.\nStudy leader Dr Lee Hudson from the Institute of Child Health, University College London, said more under-13s now presented with eating disorders than meningitis due to the success of vaccination programmes.\nThis shift in childhood illness may be one reason why his research suggested a lack of knowledge on spotting underweight children and the associated medical problems, he added.\nIn the study, one on-call paediatrician was questioned in every hospital providing acute in-patient care for children.\nDuring a phone interview they were asked how they would identify if a child was underweight and what clinical examinations they would carry out to check for severe or potentially life-threatening complications.\nOnly half said they would use Body Mass Index to decide if older

complications.\nThis was despite most respondents having experience of treating a child with an eating disorder.\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics said it was working to improve training.\nStudy leader Dr Lee Hudson from the Institute of Child Health, University College London, said more under-13s now presented with eating disorders than meningitis due to the success of vaccination programmes.\nThis shift in childhood illness may be one reason why his research suggested a lack of knowledge on spotting underweight children and the associated medical problems, he added.\nIn the study, one on-call paediatrician was questioned in every hospital providing acute in-patient care for children.\nDuring a phone interview they were asked how they would identify if a child was underweight and what clinical examinations they would carry out to check for severe or potentially life-threatening complications.\nOnly half said they would use Body Mass Index to decide if older children or adolescents were underweight, as advised in international guidelines.\nAnd only one in five said they would adjust that for appropriate cut-offs in children.\nThere was also a lack of awareness of signs and symptoms of complications in children whose weight had dropped to seriously low levels.\nThe researchers were particularly concerned that only 13% knew a specific danger sign to

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease\n\nText continuation:\ntypically display characteristic features such as ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and interstitial patterns, which are difficult to distinguish from other lung diseases. To address this challenge, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the images as either COVID-19 positive or negative. Our model is trained using a combination of transfer learning and fine-tuning, allowing it to learn from the pre-trained weights and adapt to the specific characteristics of the COVID-19 dataset. We evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and compare it to other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our model achieves a high level of accuracy and robustness, outperforming other methods in detecting COVID-19 patients from chest radiography images. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models in aiding the diagnosis of COVID-19, and highlights the importance of developing accurate and reliable diagnostic tools to combat this global health crisis.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "respond", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease\n\nText continuation:\npresence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% ($\\pm$ 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates.

He was born at Bayreuth, Bavaria and died at Dresden.\nHe studied at Erlangen, held various professorships in the philosophical and theological faculties of Erlangen and G\u00f6ttingen, succeeded Franz Volkmar Reinhard (1753\u20131812) in 1813 as court preacher and member of the Upper Consistory of the Church of Saxony at Dresden, retired from these offices in 1849.\nSeeking to establish for himself a middle position between rationalism and supernaturalism, he declared for a \"rational supernaturalism,\" and contended that there must be a gradual development of Christian doctrine corresponding to the advance of knowledge and science. But at the same time he sought, like other representatives of this\n\nText continuation:\nmovement, to reconcile the contradictions between faith and reason, and to demonstrate the harmony between the principles of Christianity and the discoveries of modern science.\nAs a result, Ammon's theological writings were characterized by a distinctive blend of rationalism and mysticism, and he became known for his ability to present complex theological concepts in a clear and accessible manner. His works were widely read and respected, and he was regarded as one of the leading theologians of his time. Despite his efforts to find a middle ground, however, Ammon's views were not without controversy, and he faced criticism from both rationalist and supernaturalist quarters.

He was born at Bayreuth, Bavaria and died at Dresden.\nHe studied at Erlangen, held various professorships in the philosophical and theological faculties of Erlangen and G\u00f6ttingen, succeeded Franz Volkmar Reinhard (1753\u20131812) in 1813 as court preacher and member of the Upper Consistory of the Church of Saxony at Dresden, retired from these offices in 1849.\nSeeking to establish for himself a middle position between rationalism and supernaturalism, he declared for a \"rational supernaturalism,\" and contended that there must be a gradual development of Christian doctrine corresponding to the advance of knowledge and science. But at the same time he sought, like other representatives of this\n\nText continuation:\nschool of thought, such as KG Bretschneider and Julius Wegscheider, to keep in close touch with the historical theology of the Protestant churches. The term Offenbarungsrationalismus (\"epiphanic rationalism\") has been used to express Ammon's intermediate views.\nHe was a man of great versatility and extensive learning, a philologist and philosopher as well as a theologian, and a very voluminous author. His principal theological work was the \"Fortbildung des Christenthums zur Weltreligion\", in 4 volumes (Leipzig, 1833\u20131840); \"Entwurf einer reinen biblischen Theologie\" appeared in 1792 (2nd edition, 1801), \"Summa Theologiae Christianas\" in 1803 (other editions, 1808, 1816, 1830); \"Das Geschichte des Lebens Jesu\" in 1842, and \"Die wahre und falsche Orthodoxie\" in 1849.\nVon Ammon's style in preaching was terse and lively, and some of his discourses are regarded as models of pulpit treatment of political questions.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "respond", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "V", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

His ideal-typical bureaucracy, whether public or private, is characterized by:\n- hierarchical organization\n- formal lines of authority (chain of command)\n- a fixed area of activity\n- rigid division of labor\n- regular and continuous execution of assigned tasks\n- all decisions and powers specified and restricted by regulations\n- officials with expert training in their fields\n- career advancement dependent on technical qualifications\n- qualifications evaluated by organizational rules, not individuals\nWeber listed several preconditions for the emergence of bureaucracy, including an increase in the amount of space and population being administered, an increase in the complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out, and the existence of a monetary economy requiring a more efficient administrative system. The development of communication and transportation technologies makes more efficient administration possible, and democratization and rationalization of culture results in demands for equal treatment. Although he was not necessarily an admirer of bureaucracy, Weber saw bureaucratization as the most efficient and rational way of organizing human activity and therefore as the key to rational-legal authority, indispensable to the modern world. Furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalization of Western society. Weber also saw bureaucracy, however, as a threat to individual freedoms, and the ongoing bureaucratization as leading to a \"polar night of icy darkness\", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in a soulless \"iron cage\" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control Weber's critical study of the bureaucratization of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work.

For example, a 2014 meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 28%. Similarly, a 2016 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a low-fat diet reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 22% compared to a low-carbohydrate diet.\nIt's also important to note that the scientific community is not monolithic, and there is ongoing debate and discussion about the optimal dietary approach for heart health.

And just like her chart career, her marriage to Carl Dean turned 50 this year.\n\"I thought, well, this would be a good year to write an album of love songs,\" she says. \"I've never done that before. I've usually had a story song or a gospel song, but this was all love stories.\"\nThe BBC caught up with the star to discuss the new record, her legendary Glastonbury set, and why she admires Adele.\nFirst of all, congratulations on celebrating your golden wedding anniversary!\nThank you so much. That's a long time to do anything, ain't it? Especially to be married.\nWhat's the secret?\nWe've always been good buddies. We have a lot of fun and a lot of respect for one another. It was his first marriage and mine and we never thought we'd ever want to do that again. Why bother?\nYou renewed your vows earlier this year. What was that like?\nThat was sweet. There was no pressure at all. We had our own little ceremony in a little chapel on our property, then we went in our little RV down to Ringgold, Georgia, and spent the night where we had married 50 years before. We took some beautiful pictures and got all dressed up. It was fun really.\nDid you wear your original wedding dress? Could you still fit into it?\nWell, I could but I don't know where it is now! I only had a simple little white dress that my mother had made for me for that wedding, but I had always wanted a beautiful, long, beaded wedding gown, so I dressed completely to the nines. I made a right nice bride!\nThat sense of romance permeates your new album.\nOh yes! In fact a lot of the songs were written just because of that.\nYou've written so many love songs over the years - how do you find new ways to talk about it?\nLove is always growing, and we grow as people as well, so you just automatically take on new twists and turns. And it's amazing. I've always been amazed by that myself, how people can just write, year in and year out, about love and it all is different. I could write one right now!\nHow often do you write?\nI write something almost every single day unless I'm sick or on a movie set.\nIs that ever an inconvenience? Do you ever find yourself going, \"I don't have time to write a song right now, I need to finish this casserole?\"\nWell, no! In fact, I write a lot when I cook. If my cooking's really good that day, my songs are really good.\nIn Head Over High Heels, you sing about \"painting my eyes like Adele.\" What made you write about her?\nEveryone loves Adele. With all my little nieces, it's all \"Adele this\" and \"Adele that!\" And I love how she does her make-up, and so I'm always saying to my little nieces, \"can you fix my eyes like Adele?\"\nWhen I started that song, I had not planned to write that line. I was just thinking, \"This needs to be about a girl dressing up sexy, so she's got to have some make-up, and she's got to paint her eyes\". And all of a sudden it's like, \"And my eyes like Adele!\"\nWhat do you think her reaction will be?\nI think she'll have to be complimented, just like I'm always complimented when people write songs about me!\nI just meant I wanted to look like Adele. I hope she thinks it's cute.\nYou both like to talk to your audience in between songs, but she swears a lot more than you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I wondered what you made of that?\nOh, I don't pay any attention to that! Words are just an exchange, like money. I don't think the Lord holds that against us. I think that's just the way we communicate. And some people are just born cussers.\nWhat's the worst thing you've ever said on stage?\nOh, I've never said anything real bad. I try to respect the audience.\nThe song I'm 16 is based on one of your sisters, is that right?\nYeah, she had a couple of bad relationships and she thought it wasn't meant for her to have true love. Then all of a sudden, in her 60s, she met someone and they fell in love, and it's just like they were born again. It's just the sweetest thing.\nAnother one of my sisters and I were laughing. We said, \"Look at her, she thinks she's 16!\" and all of a sudden I heard the song in my head.\nGoes to show you're never old unless you choose to be.\nWhat age do you think of yourself as?\nI'm 16 in some ways. I'm still a hopeless romantic! But I'm 35 in my spirit and in my mind. When I was 35, it was a pinnacle, a great time in my life - success and happiness and all that. And so I just decided \"I'm gonna claim that number and always be that in my state of mind.\"\nWhat inspired Can't Be That Wrong?\nThat was an easy one to write. I think it's the ultimate cheating song.\nI based it on someone very, very close to me, who was very much in love with the person at home, and their children, and they weren't looking for love, they just happened to fall for someone. They were so torn, because they loved both people. I saw the turmoil and the heartache, and how overwhelming and overpowering it was. And I just thought, \"That's a strong-ass love, right there\". You know, to be willing to go through all you have to, and put the other people through that. So I thought, \"wow, this would make a great song.\"\nThe last time I saw you on stage in the UK was at Glastonbury - and you've put that concert on this album as a bonus disc. What are your memories of it?\nThat'll be one of my greatest memories, actually. That'll be a real highlight in my career.\nI wasn't even certain about doing that show, because I didn't know if I was the type of artist that would fit in that type of a festival - because people are rowdy, they like to go dancing, and they like to drink and smoke and I thought, \"I wonder if they're even going to pay attention?\"\nAnd so, as soon as I went out and I saw the crowd and heard the roar, I thought, \"Ohhhh, my Lord, how did I miss this all these years?\"\nThey call that part of the day the \"legends slot\". If you were booking next year's Glastonbury, who would you put in there?\nI don't know. I hadn't even thought about it in those terms. Probably Adele.\nBut I'm not sure I'd do it again, because I don't know how I could ever top that.\nPure and Simple is out now on RCA Records.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.\n\nSummary:\nCountry music legend Dolly Parton releases her new album \"Pure & Simple\", featuring romantic songs inspired by her 50th wedding anniversary and her legendary Glastonbury performance.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

This is notably the case for Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council[18] and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council[19], where a third party conformity assessment is provided for medium-risk and high-risk products. [18] Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and repealing\n\nText continuation:\nDirective 90/385/EEC, and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2017 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices, amending Directive 98/79/EC and repealing Council Directive 98/79/EC, are examples of regulations that provide for a third party conformity assessment for medium-risk and high-risk products.\nIn the context of AI systems, this means that even if an AI system is considered high-risk under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the product or system that incorporates the AI system may not necessarily be considered high-risk under the relevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. This is because the risk associated with the AI system may be mitigated by other safety components or features of the product or system. For example, a medical device that uses AI to diagnose a medical condition may be considered medium-risk if it is designed to provide a diagnosis that is reviewed and confirmed by a human healthcare professional.\nFurthermore, the EU's Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and the EU's In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR) provide for a risk-based approach to the classification of medical devices, including those that use AI. Under these regulations, the risk associated with a medical device is determined by the device's intended use, the level of invasiveness, and the potential harm that the device may cause if it fails or is used incorrectly. If an AI system is used in a medical device, the risk associated with the device will depend on the specific use case and the level of risk associated with the AI system itself.\nIn conclusion, the classification of an AI system as high-risk under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) does not necessarily mean that the product or system that incorporates the AI system is considered high-risk under the relevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. The risk associated with an AI system must be assessed in the context of the specific product or system in which it is used, and the risk-based approach provided for in the EU's Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and the EU's In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR) should be used to determine the appropriate level of risk associated with the device.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

As regards stand-alone AI systems, meaning high-risk AI systems other than those that are safety components of products, or which are themselves products, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk if, in the light of their intended purpose, they pose a high risk of harm to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both the severity of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a number of specifically pre-defined areas specified in the Regulation. The identification of those systems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future amendments of the list of high-risk AI systems that the Commission should be empowered to adopt, via delegated acts, to take into account the rapid pace of technological development, as well as the potential changes in the use of AI systems.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "to", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston.\nThe Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has organized this event annually since 1897, except for 2020 when it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, it was held later, in October. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports, Inc., since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.\nThe event attracts 500,000 spectators each year, making it New England's most widely viewed sporting event. Starting with just 15 participants in 1897, the event now attracts an average of about 30,000 registered participants each year, with 30,251 people entering in 2015.

We analyze the effects of bonding type, molecular orientation, and geometry relaxation on the electronic properties and charge and spin transport across the single-molecule junction. We consider nine interface geometries leading to five bonding mechanisms and two molecular orientations: (i) Au-C bonding, (ii) Au-Au bonding, (iii) Au-S bonding, (iv) Au-H bonding, and (v) physisorption via van der Waals forces. The two molecular orientations of Mn$_{12}$ correspond to the magnetic easy axis of the molecule aligned perpendicular [hereafter denoted as orientation (1)] or parallel\n\nText continuation:\nto the Au(111) surface [orientation (2)]. In both cases, the Mn$_{12}$ molecule is centered above the Au(111) surface, with its magnetic axis perpendicular to the surface.\nThe electronic properties of the single-molecule junction are characterized by the transmission coefficient, which is calculated using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The transmission coefficient is a measure of the probability of an electron being transmitted from one electrode to the other through the molecule. We find that the transmission coefficient is strongly dependent on the bonding type, molecular orientation, and geometry relaxation. For example, the Au-C bonding mechanism leads to a higher transmission coefficient compared to the Au-Au bonding mechanism, while the Au-S bonding mechanism results in a lower transmission coefficient.\nThe spin transport properties of the single-molecule junction are characterized by the spin transmission coefficient, which is calculated using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The spin transmission coefficient is a measure of the probability of a spin-polarized electron being transmitted from one electrode to the other through the molecule. We find that the spin transmission coefficient is also strongly dependent on the bonding type, molecular orientation, and geometry relaxation. For example, the Au-C bonding mechanism leads to a higher spin transmission coefficient compared to the Au-Au bonding mechanism, while the Au-S bonding mechanism results in a lower spin transmission coefficient.\nIn addition to the electronic and spin transport properties, we also analyze the effects of geometry relaxation on the single-molecule junction. We find that the geometry relaxation leads to a significant change in the electronic properties of the junction, particularly in the case of the Au-C bonding mechanism. The geometry relaxation results in a reduction of the transmission coefficient and a shift of the Fermi level of the junction.\nOverall, our results show that the bonding type, molecular orientation, and geometry relaxation have a significant impact on the electronic and spin transport properties of the single-molecule magnet Mn$_{12}$ bridged between Au(111) electrodes. The results provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of single-molecule junctions for spin-based electronic devices.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The two molecular orientations of Mn$_{12}$ correspond to the magnetic easy axis of the molecule aligned perpendicular [hereafter denoted as orientation (1)] or parallel\n\nText continuation:\n[orientation (2)] to the direction of electron transport. We find that the electron transport is carried by the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level in all the cases that we have simulated. Relaxation of the junction geometries mainly shifts the relevant occupied molecular levels toward the Fermi energy as well as slightly reduces the broadening of the LUMO level. As a result, the current slightly decreases at low bias voltage. Our calculations also show that placing the molecule in the orientation (1) broadens the LUMO level much more than in the orientation (2), due to the internal structure of the Mn$_{12}$. Consequently, junctions with the former orientation yield a higher current than those with the latter. Among all of the bonding types considered, the Au-C bonding gives rise to the highest current (about one order of magnitude higher than the Au-S bonding), for a given distance between the electrodes. The current through the junction with other bonding types decreases in the order of Au-Au, Au-S, and Au-H. Importantly, the spin-filtering effect in all the nine geometries stays robust and their ratios of the majority-spin to the minority-spin transmission coefficients are in the range of 10$^3$ to 10$^8$. The general trend in transport among the different bonding types and molecular orientations obtained from this study may be applied to other single-molecular magnets.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

NBA stars such as Kobe Bryant may soon be seen on a regular basis in Europe. The astonishing claims come hard on the heels of plans by the football's English Premier League to play matches overseas and underline the growing trend of globalization in major sports leagues. This was further evidenced by Super Bowl champions New York Giants playing a regular NFL season game against the Miami Dolphins at Wembley Stadium in London, but the NBA's leaked plans go far beyond that. A report on the Sports Illustrated Web site, says NBA commisioner David Stern will reveal his proposals on the eve of the All-Star Game in New Orleans this weekend. The plans are understood to include the formation of a European division with five new teams in major markets. The teams would play a full 82-game schedule and compete for the NBA championship. It is not the first time that Stern has entertained the concept of overseas expansion. He broached the idea in 2003, saying at the time that the league would look into European expansion within a decade. Those plans were scrapped, however, with the NBA instead focusing on developing its relationship with China and other emerging basketball markets. The number of European and overseas players has steadily increased in the NBA and basketball enjoys a particularly high profile in Spain, France, Italy, Greece and the Balkans. The NBA has played regular-season games in Japan and Mexico, and played exhibition contests this season in London and Rome. Meanwhile, Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant is doubtful for Sunday's All-Star game with a damaged finger. Bryant, who dislocated his right pinkie last week, scored 29 points in 35 minutes in Wednesday's 117-92 win at Minnesota. Bryant sat out the fourth quarter and had the finger X-rayed after the game.

The calibration process can also be used to account for complex survey designs, such as stratification and clustering, by incorporating these design effects into the working model. Furthermore, the calibration weights can be used to adjust for non-response bias by weighting the complete cases by the inverse of the non-response probability.\nIn addition to the model-based calibration, other calibration methods have also been proposed, such as propensity score calibration and density ratio calibration. These methods are based on different assumptions and can be used in different contexts, such as when the inclusion probabilities are unknown or when the auxiliary variables are not available. The choice of calibration method depends on the specific survey design and the nature of the missing data.\nThe calibration methods can be applied to various types of survey data, including cross-sectional and longitudinal data, and can be used to estimate a wide range of parameters, such as population means, totals, and proportions. The methods can also be used to adjust for non-response bias in complex surveys, such as those with multiple stages of selection and non-response. Overall, the calibration methods provide a powerful tool for improving the accuracy and efficiency of survey estimates, and can be used in a variety of applications, including health surveys, economic surveys, and social surveys.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

This paper considers calibration using multiple working regression models for estimating a single or multiple parameters. Contrary to a common belief that overfitting hurts efficiency, we present three rather unexpected results. First, when the missing probability is correctly specified and multiple working regression models for the conditional mean are posited, calibration enjoys an oracle property: the same semiparametric efficiency bound is attained as if the true outcome model is known in advance. Second, when the missing data mechanism is misspecified, calibration can still be a consistent estimator when any one of the outcome regression models is correctly specified. Third, a common set of calibration weights can be used to improve efficiency in estimating multiple parameters of interest and can simultaneously attain semiparametric efficiency bounds for all parameters of interest. We provide connections of a wide class of calibration estimators, constructed based on generalized empirical likelihood, to many existing estimators in biostatistics, econometrics and survey sampling and perform simulation studies to show that the finite sample properties of calibration estimators conform well with the theoretical results being studied.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "respond", "answer_neg": "#"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Therefore public licenses, including FOSS (free, open source software) licenses, are usually publicly available in source code repositories.Objective: To compile a dataset containing as many documents as possible that contain the text of software licenses, or references to the license terms. Once compiled, characterize the dataset so that it can be used for further research, or practical purposes related to license analysis.Method: Retrieve from Software Heritage-the largest publicly available archive of FOSS source code-all versions of all files whose names are commonly used to convey licensing terms. All retrieved\n\nText continuation:\nfiles will be then parsed to extract the licensing information. This includes the license text, license name, and any relevant metadata. The extracted information will be stored in a structured format, allowing for efficient querying and analysis. The dataset will be made publicly available, enabling researchers and developers to utilize it for a variety of purposes, such as license compliance checking, software auditing, and open source software development.\nThe dataset will be characterized by analyzing the distribution of licenses, license types, and license versions. This will provide insights into the most commonly used licenses, the evolution of licensing practices over time, and the diversity of licensing terms. The dataset will also be used to identify potential issues with licensing, such as unclear or ambiguous license terms, and to develop tools and methods for automating license analysis. Additionally, the dataset will be used to study the relationship between licensing and software development, such as the impact of licensing on software adoption and the role of licensing in software evolution. By making this dataset publicly available, we aim to facilitate research in the field of software licensing and to contribute to the development of more effective and efficient licensing practices.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Therefore public licenses, including FOSS (free, open source software) licenses, are usually publicly available in source code repositories.Objective: To compile a dataset containing as many documents as possible that contain the text of software licenses, or references to the license terms. Once compiled, characterize the dataset so that it can be used for further research, or practical purposes related to license analysis.Method: Retrieve from Software Heritage-the largest publicly available archive of FOSS source code-all versions of all files whose names are commonly used to convey licensing terms. All retrieved\n\nText continuation:\ndocuments will be characterized in various ways, using automated and manual analyses.Results: The dataset consists of 6.9 million unique license files. Additional metadata about shipped license files is also provided, making the dataset ready to use in various contexts, including: file length measures, MIME type, SPDX license (detected using ScanCode), and oldest appearance. The results of a manual analysis of 8102 documents is also included, providing a ground truth for further analysis. The dataset is released as open data as an archive file containing all deduplicated license files, plus several portable CSV files with metadata, referencing files via cryptographic checksums.Conclusions: Thanks to the extensive coverage of Software Heritage, the dataset presented in this paper covers a very large fraction of all software licenses for public code. We have assembled a large body of software licenses, characterized it quantitatively and qualitatively, and validated that it is mostly composed of licensing information and includes almost all known license texts. The dataset can be used to conduct empirical studies on open source licensing, training of automated license classifiers, natural language processing (NLP) analyses of legal texts, as well as historical and phylogenetic studies on FOSS licensing. It can also be used in practice to improve tools detecting licenses in source code.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "J", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I was at a food and wine festival in Paris last year and discovered Grangers at a small boutique stand. The owner, Monsieur Granger, was there personally and introduced me to his entire range. I was blown away by the complexity and depth of flavors in each piece. I knew right then and there that I had to bring his chocolates to the US market.\nUser 2: That sounds like a fantastic experience. What kind of flavors do they offer?\nUser 1: Ah, that's the best part! Grangers has a range of unique and exotic flavors, like lavender and honey, champagne and strawberry, and even a truffle and orange combination. They also have some more traditional flavors like dark chocolate and sea salt, but with a twist. For example, their dark chocolate has a hint of smokiness from the cocoa beans being smoked over oak wood.\nUser 2: Wow, that does sound impressive. How do you plan to market these chocolates to your customers?\nUser 1: Well, I was thinking of partnering with your restaurant to offer a special promotion. We could create a customized chocolate tasting menu that pairs perfectly with your wine list. I also have some ideas for packaging and branding that would really make the chocolates stand out on your tables and in your gift shop. What do you think?

Yes I do use the typical glasses cleaner with cloth wipe...\ncrhaxter: Optician here. The best way to clean them is with regular isopropyl alcohol. Try to keep it mostly on the lenses as it is a solvent and can discolor certain plastic frames. Use only a cotton or microfiber cloth, no paper towels. Dish soap can work too. After the initial cleaning, a new microfiber cloth should keep them streak free for awhile.\nEDIT: I like to use two cloths. One for cleaning with alcohol then let lenses dry, then use a clean one to remove all residue\n\nText continuation:\nIt's great to hear that you're taking the time to clean your glasses regularly, TaylorHammond9. However, it's understandable that you're frustrated with the smears left behind. I completely agree with crhaxter's advice on using isopropyl alcohol and microfiber cloths. The key is to be gentle and avoid using too much liquid, as this can cause streaks and residue.\nIn addition to crhaxter's method, I would also recommend using a soft, dry cloth to wipe down the frames and temples after cleaning the lenses. This will help remove any dirt or debris that may have accumulated on the frame.\nAnother trick I've found helpful is to use a lens cleaning solution specifically designed for glasses. These solutions are usually ammonia-free and won't leave any streaks or residue. You can find them at most optical stores or online.\nIt's also important to note that some glasses cleaners can leave a residue on the lenses, which can attract dirt and dust. If you're using a cleaner that leaves a residue, try switching to a different brand or type of cleaner.\nIn your case, TaylorHammond9, since you only use your glasses at night, you may want to consider using a lens cleaning solution specifically designed for night use. These solutions are usually gentler and won't leave any streaks or residue.\nTo further minimize smears and streaks, I would recommend cleaning your glasses in a circular motion, starting from the center of the lens and working your way outwards. This will help prevent any dirt or debris from being pushed around and causing streaks.\nFinally, it's always a good idea to clean your glasses in a well-lit area, so you can see any streaks or smears as you clean. This will help you catch any imperfections and ensure that your glasses are clean and streak-free.\nBy following these tips and using the right cleaning solutions and cloths, you should be able to keep your glasses clean and streak-free. Remember to be patient and gentle when cleaning your glasses, and don't be afraid to experiment with different methods until you find what works best for you.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Before ordering the coating, decide if you are rough with glasses and if the coating will be worth getting. There is also a cosmetic component to the coating, it makes the lens less visible and brightens your under-eye area.\nGrouchyMcSurly: Not an optician, but I'd disagree with that method, if I may... I have never needed to wipe glasses except in emergencies.\nMy standard method is to go to a tap and:\n* rinse them of dust on both sides under the water jet\n* take some liquid soap on fingertips, check there are no abrasive inclusions by rubbing it around a second. Avoid dishwasher liquid as it's too concentrated. If you can dilute (moisten) the soap with a bit of water, that's even better.\n* wash the lenses gently on both sides with fingertips\n* rinse them out.\n* turn the lenses edge-first to the water-jet and 'scan' with them through from one side to the other, taking away almost all drops from the lens surfaces. Make sure the jet is not aerated (white water) when doing this because that leaves behind tiny droplets from bubble bursts. Just turn down the water intensity to prevent aeration, if needed.\n\n* blow away any remaining drops\n* wipe the bottom of the rim (not the lens!) on trousers, taking away dangling droplets.\nSounds long, but it takes less than 30 seconds, leaves the lenses in perfect condition and nothing except water and soapy fingertips ever touched them. I've been doing this for more than 12 years, and never had a scratch.

They also have a ton of information on their website about how to use the ingredients and how to mix them together to get the desired results.\nOne of the things I love about Making Cosmetics is that they have a wide range of products, from natural and organic options to more synthetic ingredients. This is great for people who have specific skin types or allergies, as you can choose ingredients that are gentle and non-irritating. They also have a great selection of fragrances and essential oils, which you can use to customize the scent of your products.\nAnother benefit of buying ingredients from Making Cosmetics is that you can customize the products to your specific needs. For example, if you have dry skin, you can add more moisturizing ingredients to your products. If you have oily skin, you can use ingredients that help to control oil production. This level of customization is hard to find in commercial products, which often have a one-size-fits-all approach.\nIn addition to the ingredients, Making Cosmetics also has a lot of great tutorials and recipes on their website. These can be super helpful if you're new to making your own products, as they provide step-by-step instructions on how to mix and use the ingredients. They also have a great community of users who share their own recipes and tips, which can be a great resource for inspiration and guidance.\nOverall, I've been really happy with my experience using Making Cosmetics. The prices are great, the selection is huge, and the community is super supportive. If you're interested in making your own personal care products, I would definitely recommend checking them out.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

E.g. the inclusion of water in products providing the environment for bacteria etc to grow.  I find the idea of making my own products very appealing but for things like cosmetics I feel like there's a lot that can go wrong if you don't know what you're doing (not saying you don't know what you're doing, I mean in a more general sense).\nZestfullyclean87: The first thing that comes to mind is fragrance oils.  A lot of those oils can become very dangerous if they come in contact with certain cleaning products (such as bleach)\nAll it takes is someone to throw a used towel with bleach on it, into a laundry basket with other towels with the wrong oils, maybe you have used that towel to wipe up  the ingredients you used to make soap, homemade lotion.  You can burn down your home\nBruceInc: That makes very little sense and the likelihood of it happening is zero. Bleach reacts with ammonia which isn\u2019t a likely ingredient in a skin care product.\nZestfullyclean87: I literally know someone that this happened to.  They used bleach to wash rags that were used to clean up fragrance oil.  The heat from the dryer made it worse, so it wasn\u2019t an immediate thing, but over the next day or so they had smoke filling up the house and the fire dept discovered the towels burning through the box it was sitting in\nBruceInc: Some Essential oils have very low flashpoint. Bleach likely had nothing to do with it.\nZestfullyclean87: We\u2019re not even talking essential oils, I can\u2019t speak to that.  I\u2019m talking fragrance oils, which are often very different - something you would use *just* for the fragrance\nAn essential oil is when you take a concentrated essence from something (like flowers, lemons, peppermint).  They may have a natural fragrance, but fragrance oils are not the same as essential oils.  Raw fragrance oils are flammable \nOnce they\u2019re mixed in with something like a skincare product it\u2019s fine, but if you wiped up spilled oil with a rag, don\u2019t use bleach.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "You", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In a Las Vegas Review-Journal article, Lipman stated: \"My biggest concern is to counter the propaganda from people who think that people who don't believe in a supernatural deity cannot live moral, ethical lives.\"  Lipman said his top priority \"is to change people's attitudes about Humanists\".  \"It is not OK\", said Lipman, in the Review\n\nText continuation:\n-Journal, \"to assume that just because someone doesn't believe in a higher power, they are somehow less worthy or less capable of making moral choices.\" He believed that Humanists, like himself, were often misunderstood and that by sharing their stories and values, they could help to dispel common misconceptions.\nThroughout his career, Lipman was dedicated to promoting the values of Humanism, including reason, compassion, and the pursuit of knowledge. He was a strong advocate for the separation of Church and State, and he believed that this principle was essential for protecting the rights and freedoms of all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof. Lipman was also a passionate advocate for social justice and equality, and he worked tirelessly to promote these values through his work with various organizations and community groups.\nIn addition to his work as an attorney and activist, Lipman was also a prolific writer and speaker. He wrote numerous articles and essays on topics related to Humanism, Church/State separation, and social justice, and he was a frequent guest speaker at conferences and events around the country.

He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education.\nFrom 1882 to 1922, Egypt was under British military occupation, and its government heavily under the influence (control) of the British Empire. The first Consul-General, Sir Evelyn Baring (later 1st Earl of Cromer), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian Ministry of Education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner.\nDunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant\n\nText continuation:\n) education system that would produce loyal and obedient citizens who would support British interests in the region. To achieve this, Dunlop introduced a number of reforms, including the creation of a new curriculum that emphasized Western-style education, the establishment of a network of schools and educational institutions, and the promotion of English language and culture.\nUnder Dunlop's guidance, the Egyptian education system was transformed, with a focus on producing students who were well-versed in Western subjects such as mathematics, science, and literature, but also familiar with British customs and values. The system was designed to produce a class of educated Egyptians who would be loyal to the British and supportive of their colonial rule. Dunlop's reforms were widely criticized by Egyptian nationalists, who saw them as a means of suppressing Egyptian culture and identity. Despite this, Dunlop's system remained in place for many years, shaping the course of Egyptian education and influencing the country's development for generations to come.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "D", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "D", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "D", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant\n\nText continuation:\n) educated governing class and civil service, modelled on their experiences in British India. The education policy of the Egyptian government prior to the occupation had been to create a meritocratic system. Dunlop, on the other hand, oversaw the creation of an elitist two-tier system, with fees introduced for the elite schools. Modernisation also occurred, with elemental schooling being both centralised and expanded.\nPrior to the British occupation, the administrative languages of Egypt had been French and Turkish. With British influence, English became the preferred language. This brought increasing controversy, as Egyptian nationalists sought to reassert Arabic. Dunlop, even after thirty years in Egypt, like Cromer, did not speak Arabic. He primarily promoted teaching in English, preferring to employ British teachers and attempting to marginalise teaching in Arabic and French.\nIn 1907, Saad Zaghlul (later revolutionary leader and post-independence prime minister) became Minister of Education. Zaghul strongly promoted Arabic in education, and necessarily locking horns with his British advisor. Dunlop became a figure associated with British resistance to Egyptian anti-colonialism. Dunlop resigned his post during the Egyptian revolution of 1919.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "D", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Both", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

An extension method is a method declared in a package other than the package of its host class. Thanks to extension methods, developers can adapt to their needs classes they do not own: adding methods to core classes is a typical use case. This is particularly useful for adapting software and therefore to increase reusability. Inquiry. In most dynamically-typed languages, extension methods are globally visible. Because any developer can define extension methods for any class, naming conflicts occur: if two developers define an extension method with the same signature in the same class, only one extension method is visible and overwrites the other. Similarly, if two developers each define an extension method with the same name in a class hierarchy, one overrides the other. To avoid such\n\nText continuation:\nconflicts, many languages provide a way to qualify the extension method with a namespace or an alias, which helps to disambiguate the method name.\nTo further mitigate this issue, some languages also provide a way to explicitly specify the order in which extension methods are resolved. For example, in languages like C# and F#, extension methods can be marked as \"static\" or \"instance\" to indicate whether they should be resolved based on the static type or the runtime type of the object. This allows developers to control the order in which extension methods are called and reduces the likelihood of naming conflicts.\nIn addition to addressing naming conflicts, extension methods can also be used to provide a more intuitive and natural interface to a class. By adding methods that are semantically related to the class, developers can make the class more usable and easier to understand. For example, in a class that represents a bank account, an extension method could be added to calculate the interest earned on the account over a given period. This would make the class more intuitive and easier to use, as developers would not need to write custom code to perform this calculation.\nOverall, extension methods are a powerful tool for adapting software and increasing reusability. By providing a way to add methods to existing classes, they allow developers to create more intuitive and natural interfaces to those classes, while also reducing the likelihood of naming conflicts.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "to", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

However, their semantics have not been fully described and compared. In addition, these solutions typically rely on a dedicated and slow method lookup algorithm to resolve conflicts at runtime. Approach. In this article, we present a formalization of the underlying models of Ruby refinements, Groovy categories, Classboxes, and Method Shelters that are scoping extension method solutions in dynamically-typed languages. Knowledge. Our formal framework allows us to objectively compare and analyze the shortcomings of the studied solutions and other different approaches such as MultiJava. In addition, language designers can use our formal framework to determine which mechanism has less risk of \"accidental overrides\". Grounding. Our comparison and analysis of existing solutions is grounded because it is based on denotational semantics formalizations. Importance. Extension methods are widely used in programming languages that support them, especially dynamically-typed languages such as Pharo, Ruby or Python. However, without a carefully designed mechanism, this feature can cause insidious hidden bugs or can be voluntarily used to gain access to protected operations, violate encapsulation or break fundamental invariants.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

However, other branches of artificial intelligence have designed crucial ingredients towards autonomous learning: curiosity and intrinsic motivation, social learning and natural interaction with peers, and embodiment. These mechanisms guide exploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep learning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made great advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human learning. As argued convincingly by Lake et al., differences include human capabilities to learn causal models of the world from very little data, leveraging compositional representations and\n\nText continuation:\nhierarchical abstraction. Moreover, humans exhibit a remarkable ability to generalize and adapt to new situations, often relying on incomplete or noisy data.\nOne of the key challenges in developing autonomous lifelong learning systems is the ability to balance exploration and exploitation. Humans are able to strike a delicate balance between exploring new possibilities and exploiting what they already know, allowing them to adapt to changing environments and learn from experience. In contrast, current DL systems often struggle to balance these two competing goals, leading to a lack of adaptability and flexibility. To overcome this challenge, researchers are exploring new approaches that combine elements of curiosity-driven exploration with reinforcement learning, allowing agents to learn through trial and error while also adapting to new situations.\nAnother important consideration is the role of embodiment in autonomous learning. Humans learn and adapt through a combination of sensory input and motor output, allowing them to interact with the world in a meaningful way. In contrast, current DL systems are often limited to processing abstract representations of data, without the ability to interact with the physical world. To develop more human-like autonomous learning systems, researchers are exploring new approaches that integrate sensory-motor feedback with deep learning, allowing agents to learn through direct interaction with the environment.\nIn conclusion, autonomous lifelong development and learning is a complex and multifaceted capability that is still beyond the reach of current artificial intelligence systems. However, by combining elements of curiosity, social learning, and embodiment with deep learning, researchers are making progress towards developing more human-like autonomous learning systems. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, we may eventually develop systems that are capable of truly autonomous lifelong learning, with the potential to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, education, and beyond.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "To", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "To", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

However, there are other fundamental differences between current DL systems and human learning, as well as technical ingredients to fill this gap, that are either superficially, or not adequately, discussed by Lake et al. These fundamental mechanisms relate to autonomous development and learning. They are bound to play a central role in artificial intelligence in the future. Current DL systems require engineers to manually specify a task-specific objective function for every new task, and learn through off-line processing of large training databases. On the contrary, humans learn autonomously open-ended repertoires of skills, deciding for themselves which goals to pursue or value, and which skills to explore, driven by intrinsic motivation/curiosity and social learning through natural interaction with peers. Such learning processes are incremental, online, and progressive. Human child development involves a progressive increase of complexity in a curriculum of learning where skills are explored, acquired, and built on each other, through particular ordering and timing. Finally, human learning happens in the physical world, and through bodily and physical experimentation, under severe constraints on energy, time, and computational resources. In the two last decades, the field of Developmental and Cognitive Robotics (Cangelosi and Schlesinger, 2015, Asada et al., 2009), in strong interaction with developmental psychology and neuroscience, has achieved significant advances in computational\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Both", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

However, I do have a few suggestions to consider:\n* For strengthening your back, you may want to consider adding some exercises that target the latissimus dorsi muscles, such as pull-ups or assisted pull-ups. You're already doing chin-ups, which is a great start, but you may want to consider increasing the difficulty by adding weight or using a resistance band.\n* For your wrists and forearms, you're doing a good job with the grip exercises and fingertip planks. However, you may want to consider adding some exercises that target the forearm muscles, such as wrist curls or forearm extensions.\n* For handstand push-ups, you may want to consider adding some exercises that target the shoulder muscles, such as push-ups or shoulder press. You're already doing decline pike push-ups, which is a great exercise for building strength, but you may want to consider adding some variations to target different muscle groups.\nHere's an example of how you could modify your routine to incorporate some of these suggestions:\nOn Days (every 2nd day):\n* Warm-Up w. Wrist Warm-Up (10min)\n* 4x3 Chin-Ups (Building strength for Pull-Ups)\n* 3x4 Beginner Shrimp Squats\n* 3x8 Decline Pike Push-Ups\n* 3x8 Flat Straight Leg Raises\n* 3x15s Fingertip Planks (Weak wrists, building strength for Fingertip Push-Ups)\n* 3x30s Arched Hold\n* 3x45s Reverse Plank Bridge\n* 3x30s Hollow Body Hold\n* 3x10 Wrist Curls (Forearm strength)\n* 3x10 Forearm Extensions (Forearm strength)\n* 3x8 Pull-Ups (Building strength for Handstand Push-Ups)\n* 3x60s Weighed Plank\n* 10s [Yaad Lean](http://antranik.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/yaad-lean.jpg)\n* Cool-Down (6-7min)\nOff Days\nYou could also consider adding some active recovery exercises on your off days, such as light cardio or yoga, to help with recovery and prevent injury. Additionally, you may want to consider increasing the difficulty of your exercises over time by adding weight, increasing the number of reps, or decreasing rest time between sets.\nOverall, your routine is a great start, and with a few modifications, you can continue to make progress towards your goals.

But why stop there ? Is time a constraint ?\nYou can strengthen pretty much the whole body if you add in progressions for horizontal push(PPPUs) and pull (Tuck lever rows) to your current routine which already has vertical push, pull and legs. You might have to split up the days into push/pull days like in the recommend routine or into verical/horizontal days (my current routine) with rest days inbetween. \nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Train everything so that there are no weak links. The choice is upto you though :)\nihatepepperballs: Back and forearms/wrists are my biggest weakness right now, so that's what I'm focusing on.\nBy the way: how could I split this into two parts? I would like to do the first half in the morning, then the second one in the afternoon.\nThanks for the input :)\nn3ox1ne: Its a 2 day split. For example, Monday would be horizontal day with pushups/rows/core. Tuesday would be rest day and Wednesday would be vertical day with pullups/dips(will move to hspu after getting good stable handstands)/legs. Thursday would be rest and Friday would be horizontal again and it just repeats like that every day, rest, train, rest.\nThis is my personal routine modified from the recommend one. It makes sense to me and works for me. It might be different for you. Stick to the recommend routine for 2 or 3 months atleast and then make changes if needed. Good luck and enjoy this journey :D\nihatepepperballs: I feel like that's too much rest time, especially for a teenager. I want action, dammit :D\nAre you sure it would be more beneficial to split it into two days when I could do the whole thing in one?\nn3ox1ne: Your recovery time will have to increase especially after progressing to the intermediate movements. The tendons and joints will need more rest between sessions. Otherwise you will overtrain the body and get injured. Remember this is not a race. Take it slow and stay injury free. This is all my opinion though. To praphrase Phi \"Stick to the goddamn recommend routine\" xD\nihatepepperballs: I always feel so lazy on rest days.\n*What do you mean I have to ACTIVELY do nothing?*\nOh well, I guess it must be so then.\nAlso, I love that you used an emoticon after every reply.\nxD\nn3ox1ne: You don't have to do nothing (double negatives ftw) on rest days.You can do some running or stretching or yoga or some light sports.

Conversely, we prove that holomorphic nondegeneracy is necessary for this property of CR mappings to hold. For the case of unequal dimensions, we also prove that if $M$ is an algebraic hypersurface in $ C^N$ which does not contain any complex variety of positive codimension and $M'$ is the sphere in $ C^{N+1 }$ , then extendability holds for all CR mappings with certain minimal a priori regularity. Theorem A. Let $M$ and $M'$ be two algebraic hypersurfaces in $C^N$ and assume that $M$ is connected and holomorphically\n\nText continuation:\nnondegenerate. Then any CR mapping $F$ from $M$ to $M'$ with Jacobian not identically zero can be extended to a holomorphic mapping from a neighborhood of $M$ to $M'$.\nWe will now provide a proof of this theorem. Let $F$ be a CR mapping from $M$ to $M'$ with Jacobian not identically zero. Since $M$ is connected and holomorphically nondegenerate, we can choose a point $p$ on $M$ such that the tangent space to $M$ at $p$ is not contained in any complex variety of positive codimension. Let $V$ be the complex variety of positive codimension in $C^N$ that contains the tangent space to $M$ at $p$. Then $V$ is a proper closed complex subvariety of $C^N$ that contains $M$.\nLet $U$ be a neighborhood of $M$ in $C^N$ such that $U$ does not intersect $V$ and $F$ is defined on $U$. Since $F$ is a CR mapping, we can write $F$ in the form $F(z)=\\left(f_1(z),\\ldots,f_N(z)\\right)$, where $f_1,\\ldots,f_N$ are real-valued functions on $U$ that satisfy the CR equations $\\overline{\\partial}f_j=0$ for $j=1,\\ldots,N$. Since $F$ is holomorphically nondegenerate, we can choose a point $q$ on $M$ such that the Jacobian matrix of $F$ at $q$ has rank $N$.\nLet $W$ be a neighborhood of $q$ in $U$ such that the Jacobian matrix of $F$ is invertible on $W$. Then $F$ is a diffeomorphism from $W$ to $F(W)$. Since $F(W)$ is a neighborhood of $F(q)$ in $M'$, we can choose a point $r$ on $M'$ such that $F(q)$ is in the connected component of $M'$ that contains $r$.

Conversely, we prove that holomorphic nondegeneracy is necessary for this property of CR mappings to hold. For the case of unequal dimensions, we also prove that if $M$ is an algebraic hypersurface in $ C^N$ which does not contain any complex variety of positive codimension and $M'$ is the sphere in $ C^{N+1 }$ , then extendability holds for all CR mappings with certain minimal a priori regularity. Theorem A. Let $M$ and $M'$ be two algebraic hypersurfaces in $C^N$ and assume that $M$ is connected and holomorphically\n\nText continuation:\nnondegenerate. If $H$ is a smooth CR mapping from $M$ to $M'$ with $ Jac H \\not\\equiv 0$, where $Jac H$ is the Jacobian determinant of $H$, then $H$ extends holomorphically in an open neighborhood of $M$ in $ C^N$. A recent example given by Ebenfelt shows that the conclusion of Theorem A need not hold if $M$ is real analytic, but not algebraic. Theorem B. Let $M$ be a connected real analytic hypersurface in $C^N$ which is holomorphically degenerate at some point $p_1$. Let $p_0 \\in M$ and suppose there exists a germ at $p_0$ of a smooth CR function on $M$ which does not extend holomorphically to any full neighborhood of $p_0$ in $C^N$. Then there exists a germ at $p_0$ of a smooth CR diffeomorphism from $M$ into itself, fixing $p_0$, which does not extend holomorphically to any neighborhood of $p_0$ in $C^N$. Theorem C. Let $M\\subset C^N$ be an algebraic hypersurface. Assume that there is no nontrivial complex analytic variety contained in $M$ through $p_0 \\in M$, and let $m=m_{p_0}$ be the D'Angelo type. If $H: M \\to S^{2N+1}\\subset C^{N+1}$ is a CR map of class $C^m$, where $S^{2N+1}$ denotes the boundary of the unit ball in $C^{N+1 }$, then $H$ admits a holomorphic extension in a neighborhood of $p_0$.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "&", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Barack Obama decisively defeated Sen. Hillary Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday, but Clinton's narrow victory in Indiana will likely send the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on to the next round of primaries. Sen. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, greet supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina. As polls closed in Indiana, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Obama, but by the end of the evening, Clinton's lead had shrunk, dragging the race out until early Wednesday. A clear winner did not emerge until 1:15 a.m. Wednesday -- seven hours after the polls closed -- because results were slow to come in from Lake County, a Chicago suburb in northwestern Indiana with several precincts that went strongly for Obama. By Wednesday morning, all absentee ballots had been counted in Lake County and the final results showed Obama had taken the county by 12 percentage points. There were 115 delegates at stake in North Carolina and 72 in Indiana. Because Democratic delegates are awarded proportionally, Obama added four delegates to his lead, according to CNN estimates. Obama earlier claimed a decisive victory in North Carolina. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Obama held a 14-point lead over Clinton.  Watch analysis of NC, IN primaries \u00bb . \"Some were saying that North Carolina would be a game-changer in this election. But today, what North Carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in Washington,\" Obama told supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Watch Obama thank his supporters \u00bb . Obama took an overwhelming 91 percent of the black vote in North Carolina, according to exit polls, while Clinton claimed only 6 percent. Clinton took 59 percent of the white vote compared to 36 percent for Obama, according to the polls. Clinton told her supporters in Indianapolis, \"it's full-speed on to the White House.\"  Watch Clinton greet her supporters \u00bb . Clinton made a strong pitch to blue-collar workers in Indiana. She pulled a majority of the votes in rural and suburban Indiana during Tuesday's primary. In CNN exit polling, Clinton took 53 percent of the vote in suburban areas, compared with 47 percent for Obama of Illinois. She took 68 percent of the rural vote compared with Obama's 32 percent. In all, 1,738 voters were polled. Clinton had pitched herself as the candidate best-suited to turn around a flailing economy and consciously courted working-class voters in the state -- even driving a pickup truck up to a gas pump once to help promote her proposed temporary rollback of federal tax on gasoline. \"I believe that Americans need a champion in their corners,\" she said at a rally in Indianapolis. \"For too long we've had a president who has stood up and spoken out for the wealthy and the well-connected, but I don't think that's what Americans need. \"Standing up for working people is about the American dream and about the Democratic Party; standing up for the middle class is who we are and what we can be if we stick together.\" Eighty-nine percent of Indiana voters said they have been affected by what they called a recession. Clinton had a slight edge when voters were asked who is most likely to improve the economy -- taking 49 percent to Obama's 47 percent. The candidates now turn their attention to the upcoming contests in West Virginia, Kentucky and Oregon. According to early exit polls, half of Clinton's supporters in Indiana would not vote for Obama in a general election matchup with Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.  Watch what the exit polls show \u00bb . A third of Clinton voters said they would pick McCain over Obama, while 17 percent said they would not vote at all. Forty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would back Obama in November. Obama got even less support from Clinton backers in North Carolina, where 45 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for him over McCain. Thirty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for McCain while 12 percent said they would not vote. Obama voters appear to be more willing to support Clinton in November. In Indiana, 59 percent of Obama backers said they'd vote for Clinton, and 70 percent of Obama backers in North Carolina said vote for her against McCain. Obama on Tuesday said he didn't agree with those who said his party would not be able to unite. \"Tonight, many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided -- that Sen. Clinton's supporters will not support me, and that my supporters will not support her,\" he said. \"I'm here tonight to tell you that I don't believe it. Yes, there have been bruised feelings on both sides. Yes, each side desperately wants their candidate to win. But ultimately, this race is not about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain. \"This election is about you -- the American people -- and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future.\" Obama currently leads in pledged delegates and in states won, and he is ahead in the popular vote, if Florida and Michigan are not factored into the equation. Those states are being penalized for moving their primaries up in violation of party rules. With neither candidate expected to win the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination by June 3, the end of the primary season, the final decision will most likely fall to the 796 superdelegates: Democratic governors, members of Congress and party officials.  Watch how superdelegates could come into play \u00bb . Both candidates have spent the past two weeks shuttling between Indiana and North Carolina, each arguing to crucial working-class voters that their rival is out of touch when it comes to the pocketbook issues that are dominating the campaign. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Dan Lothian and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.\n\nSummary:\nSen. Barack Obama defeats Sen.

Hillary Clinton rebounded from her third-place finish in last week's Iowa caucuses. Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent the past few days saying she has the experience to change Washington. She narrowly defeated Sen. Barack Obama in the New Hampshire primary, with 39 percent of the vote to Obama's 37. \"Last week, I listened to you, and in the process I found my own voice,\" the New York senator said after her victory. \"Now let's give America the kind of comeback that New Hampshire has just given me.\" Forty-three percent of self-styled independents said they voted for Obama, and 31 percent said they backed Clinton. Independents made up 43 percent of all voters polled. Addressing his roaring supporters after the race was called, Obama congratulated Clinton. But he was a candidate determined to draw a distinction between Clinton and himself. \"But the reason our campaign has always been different, the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago, is because it's not just about what I will do as president,\" he said. \"It is also about what you, the people who love this country, the citizens of the United States of America, can do to change it. That's what this election is all about.\" But Clinton was ahead of Obama 45 percent to 34 percent among those who said they were registered Democrats. Those voters made up a majority -- 54 percent -- of all respondents. Clinton also claimed the majority of women's votes, according to the polling. That's in contrast to last week's Iowa caucuses, in which Obama surprised observers by stealing the female vote from Clinton. Analysts say that shift among female voters was crucial to the Clinton turnaround. \"If I had a single word, the word would be 'women,' \" said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider. \"She got the women back.\" And Schneider said the support of union voters that put Clinton over the top. \"Union voters have her a 10 point lead,\" he said. CNN projected former Sen. John Edwards to finish third. College graduates, who made up 29 percent of the electorate, opted narrowly for Clinton -- 38 percent to Obama's 37 percent, according to the polling. Those polled who called themselves very liberal, and moderate, went with Clinton over Obama -- although by less than 2 percentage points in each -- and those who said they are somewhat liberal were evenly split. Pundits also were citing the role of former President Bill Clinton in helping his wife recover from what pre-primary polls were suggesting was a deficit of 9 percentage points to Obama in New Hampshire. The former president spent Tuesday in Hanover -- home to Dartmouth College -- where Obama had been expected to win handily. \"They dispatched him to the area that Obama was surging,\" said CNN analyst Donna Brazille, who managed former Vice President Al Gore's campaign in 2000. \"I think it had the effect of tamping down Obama support and giving Senator Clinton a real reason to come back in this race.\" New Hampshire was considered crucial to Clinton's campaign. If Obama had been able to sweep Iowa and New Hampshire -- after months of Clinton being considered the front-runner among Democrats -- it could have given him powerful momentum going into future primaries. \"Age is also playing a big factor -- older voters are overwhelmingly outnumbering younger voters -- a proportion that is clearly benefiting Clinton,\" Schneider said. \"Sixty-seven percent of Democratic primary voters are over the age of 40, and they are breaking heavily for Clinton over Obama.\" Over the past several days, Clinton has trumpeted her experience, saying that she has delivered change as both first lady and as a senator. After losing to Obama in last week's Iowa caucuses, it was unclear whether she could overcome what appeared to be Obama's ability to electrify American voters who had previously taken a sour and skeptical view of politicians and the political process. The duel between the Obama and Clinton campaigns grew especially testy Monday and Tuesday. She said she had more experience than he, and was therefore more qualified. He accused her of representing the status quo of Washington. And on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Bill Clinton criticized the media for not pressing Obama more fully on Iraq, and accused the Illinois senator of shifting his position to reflect changing attitudes about the war in Iraq. Then, there was an issue unto itself -- Hillary Clinton's almost-tears. Clinton's eyes welled up this week while responding to a voter's question about her health and appearance. Pundits and voters alike questioned whether Clinton's emotions were sincere or faked as part of some strategy to diminish criticism that she is too steely, too cold. In front of the crowd of mostly female New Hampshire voters, an admittedly fatigued Clinton responded to a question by saying: \"This is very personal for me, it's not just political, it's [that] I see what's happening, we have to reverse it.\" Her voice broke, and she was then applauded by the crowd. Polls indicated the show of emotions fared well with male voters, according to CNN's John King, but turned off some female voters. Edwards was followed in votes by New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich.

We'll reassess your workload after the first two weeks and adjust accordingly. You'll also have the opportunity to provide feedback and make any necessary adjustments to your schedule.\nUser 2: Alright, that sounds reasonable. What kind of support can I expect from the school in terms of resources and materials?\nUser 1: We provide all the necessary materials and resources for your classes, including textbooks, handouts, and technology. You'll also have access to our staff development program, which offers training and workshops on teaching techniques and curriculum development.\nUser 2: That's great to hear. What about office hours? Will I have dedicated time to meet with students or will I need to make arrangements with the school?\nUser 1: You'll have dedicated office hours, which will be scheduled with the school's administration. You'll also have access to our student services department, which can assist with any student-related issues or concerns.\nUser 2: Okay, I think that covers everything.

Others might call him crazy. I-Reporter Joshua Hanson offered a look at the Mark IV helmet from his \"Legendary Limited Edition Halo 3.\" Hanson waited more than eight hours outside a Woodbury, Minnesota, video game store on Monday evening to be the first in his town to buy one of the most anticipated video games in history -- \"Halo 3.\"  Watch Hanson buying the game amid cheers \u00bb . The final chapter in Microsoft's acclaimed video game series hit shelves at the stroke of midnight Monday in similar stores across the nation. The Xbox 360 game is expected to shatter entertainment sales records within its first 24 hours of release. Hanson is not alone in his loyalty to the game, and his belief in \"Halo's\" power to entertain and inspire. We asked other CNN.com readers for their take on \"Halo 3.\" Some offered comparisons to \"Star Wars\" and \"Harry Potter,\" while others discussed compelling new graphics and features. Below is a selection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Curt Otto of Springfield, Virginia I waited in line for two-and-half hours to get this game at midnight. I purchased the Legendary Edition of this game at a hefty $130! Totally worth it! Although I haven't slept since yesterday and I'm currently at work and very tired, I would do it all over again for \"Halo.\" This is the GREATEST game ever crafted by the hand of man. If you own a 360, buy this game. If you don't own a 360, buy one and go buy this game! The single player is incredible and the online multiplayer is MIND BLOWING! Totally worth $130!!! Tony Nash of Buffalo, New York  I've been playing \"Halo\" since the very first game came out in 2001. After getting the brand new Box with a copy of \"Halo\" and throwing myself into the game, I quickly realized this wasn't a standard gaming experience. It was something much, much more. The game had a great attitude and unique art style. Along with great audio and environments that brought the worlds to life. It also had the most addictive, natural, and fun game play I've ever experienced. It also contained a well written, downright intriguing story. Getting together with friends to play the multiplayer portion of the game only cemented this title's epic status. Then came November 2004, when, of course, a friend and I were in the lines for the Midnight release of \"Halo 2.\" It is no joke; \"Halo\" is more than just a game. Now, I plan on \"finishing the fight\" as soon as I leave work. I had \"Halo 3\" pre-ordered for about a month before it came out. Hey, after all, it's good to keep the kid inside you alive and well! Cody Chmelik of Clearwater, Florida  \"Halo 3\" is the most anticipated event since the trial of O.J., but the only difference is that \"Halo\" isn't disappointing. \"Halo 3\" was the best game I have ever played. The levels are choreographed perfectly, the players look real and the game play is phenomenal. I recommend this game to players of all ages. Wayne S. of Colorado Springs, Colorado  \"Halo\" is not just a game, it's a lifestyle, a booming culture of millions of Xbox fans who eat, sleep and live \"Halo.\" \"Halo\" has jumped started the major league gaming industry and will continue to do so with \"Halo 3.\" I will be getting my copy of \"Halo 3\" at midnight and plan on playing it for days straight. I have played the beta and let me tell you: This is the best video game of the year by far and will be played by the masses for years to come just like \"Halo 2.\" Brian Baker of Beatrice, Nebraska I am 30 years old, and for my 30th birthday my wife pre-ordered \"Halo 3\" for me as a birthday present. The 6 month wait for the present/game didn't bother me one bit. The story that is \"Halo\" is something that people can easily identify with. The late '70s to late '90s had Luke Skywalker and the alpha-male heroes of \"Star Wars.\" The Generation X, Y and Z now have an alpha-male hero of their own in the Master Chief that they can relate to, or use to associate different attitudes and help instill values of patriotism. In this case, patriotism is not for just a country, but an entire planet and species. I am a very patriotic person, a veteran and a father and see the values that may hide below the surface in this Trilogy, which is why I'm a \"Halo\" fan. Jarrod Leda of Tarentum, Pennsylvania  Despite the hype, I am very excited for this [new game]. Some question why \"Halo\" got so big, as there are other good shooters very similar to it. I think, like \"Star Wars\" before it, it just got things right. And now, it's become iconic: the characters, the universe, it's something everyone who loves games can talk about and share. The game allows things that most other games would not; the physics and mechanics of the engine are great. And it plays flawlessly on X-box live. I can't wait. Vivek Patel of Albany, New York  \"Halo\" can be compared to \"Harry Potter\" in that when you start reading or playing you have to finish. The third installment gamers will wait in line for hours; even bleed to finally finish the fight that was started years ago. To me \"Halo 3\" isn't even advertised that much, and they will achieve their records by sheer popularity. Alessandro Miglio of Walnut Creek, California  The \"Halo\" franchise is like a budding \"Star Trek\" phenomenon. There are a lot of hardcore fans, like myself, who are not just really into the games, but read all the books and comics that expand the universe. We even write tons of theories and fan fictions with all the potential created by the \"Haloverse.\" I consider myself a \"Trekkie\" of \"Halo,\" loud and proud.

A subreddit dedicated to building regular houses would be a fantastic resource. I'd recommend checking out r/HomeImprovement, r/DIY, and r/Architecture, as they cover a wide range of topics related to building and designing homes.\nAs for your concept, it sounds like you're planning to build a foundation slab, which is a common and effective way to create a solid base for your house. When it comes to preparing the ground for the slab, you'll want to make sure it's level, compact, and free of any debris or obstructions.\nTo do this, you can start by excavating the area to the desired depth, then compacting the soil using a plate compactor or a hand tamper. You may also need to add a layer of compacted aggregate material, such as crushed stone or gravel, to provide a stable base for the slab.\nOnce you've prepared the ground, you can pour the slab and let it set. After that, you can start building your walls using concrete blocks, which is a great choice for a DIY project. When it comes to cavity fill, you'll want to choose a material that provides good insulation and can withstand the elements.\nSome popular options for cavity fill include fiberglass batts, spray foam insulation, and rigid foam board. You can also consider using a combination of these materials to achieve the desired level of insulation and structural integrity.\nAnother thing to consider is the type of concrete blocks you'll be using. You'll want to choose blocks that are designed for exterior use and can withstand the weather conditions in Texas. You may also want to consider using blocks with a built-in insulation value, such as those made with foam inserts or filled with insulation material.\nIn terms of the design of your house, you may want to consider factors such as the orientation of the building, the placement of windows and doors, and the overall aesthetic you're aiming for. You can also look for inspiration online or in architecture books to get a sense of different styles and designs.\nFinally, don't forget to check with local building codes and regulations to ensure that your design meets all the necessary requirements. It's also a good idea to consult with a professional builder or architect to get their input and guidance on your project.\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\nphylet: Ah, great point about the local building codes!

Perhaps the focus would shift from the fetus's rights to the mother's autonomy and bodily integrity.\nIt's interesting to consider how societal attitudes towards pregnancy and childbirth have evolved over time. In many ancient cultures, women were seen as vessels for childbirth, and their bodies were often treated as mere containers for the growing fetus. This perspective has slowly changed, and today we recognize the importance of respecting a woman's right to make decisions about her own body.\nBut what about the moral implications of abortion? Do we truly believe that a fetus is a human being, deserving of the same rights and protections as a born individual? Or do we recognize that the moral status of a fetus is more complex, and that the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be left to the individual woman?\nUltimately, the debate around abortion is a deeply personal and emotional one, and it's difficult to find a clear-cut solution. However, by acknowledging the complexity of the issue and engaging in respectful dialogue, we can work towards creating a more compassionate and just society for all individuals, regardless of their gender or reproductive status.\nIn the end, the decision to have an abortion is a difficult one that should be made with careful consideration and respect for all parties involved. While it's impossible to know for certain what the moral status of a fetus is, we can strive to create a world where every individual, regardless of their age or stage of development, is treated with dignity and respect.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "To", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

His home and birthplace at 2639 Monmouth Avenue has been designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. He was a member of a prominent Illinois political family. His grandfather and namesake Adlai Stevenson I was Vice President of the United States under President Grover Cleveland from 1893 to 1897. His father, Lewis Stevenson, never held an elected office, but was appointed Illinois Secretary of State (1914\u20131917) and was considered a strong contender for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination in 1928. A maternal great-grandfather, Jesse W. Fell, had been a close friend and campaign manager for Abraham Lincoln in his 1858 US Senate race; Stevenson often referred to Fell as his favorite ancestor. Stevenson's eldest son, Adlai E. Stevenson III, became a U.S. Senator from Illinois (1970\u20131981). His mother was Helen Davis Stevenson, and he had an older sister, Elizabeth Stevenson Ives, an author who was called \"Buffie\". Actor McLean Stevenson was a second cousin once removed. He was the nephew by marriage of novelist Mary Borden, and she assisted in the writing of some of his political speeches.\nStevenson was raised in the city of Bloomington, Illinois; his family was a member of Bloomington's upper class and lived in one of the city's well-to-do neighborhoods. On December 30, 1912, at the age of twelve, Stevenson accidentally killed Ruth Merwin, a 16-year-old friend, while demonstrating drill technique with a rifle, inadvertently left loaded, during a party at the Stevenson home. Stevenson was devastated by the accident and rarely mentioned or discussed it as an adult, even with his wife and children. However, in 1955 Stevenson heard about a woman whose son had experienced a similar tragedy. He wrote to her that she should tell her son that \"he must now live for two\", which Stevenson's friends took to be a reference to the shooting incident.\nStevenson left Bloomington High School after his junior year and attended University High School in Normal, Illinois, Bloomington's \"twin city\", just to the north. He then went to boarding school in Connecticut at The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall), where he played on the tennis team, acted in plays, and was elected editor-in-chief of The Choate News, the school newspaper. Upon his graduation from Choate in 1918, he enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve and served at the rank of seaman apprentice, but his training was completed too late for him to participate in World War I.\nHe attended Princeton University, becoming managing editor of The Daily Princetonian, a member of the American Whig-Cliosophic Society, a member of the Quadrangle Club, and received a B.A. degree in 1922 in literature and history. Under prodding from his father he then went to Harvard Law School, but found the law to be \"uninteresting\", and withdrew after failing several classes. He returned to Bloomington where he wrote for the family newspaper, The Daily Pantagraph, which was founded by his maternal great-grandfather Jesse Fell. The Pantagraph, which had one of the largest circulations of any newspaper in Illinois outside the Chicago area, was a main source of the Stevenson family's wealth. Following his mother's death in 1935, Adlai inherited one-quarter of the Pantagraph's stock, providing him with a large, dependable source of income for the rest of his life.\nA year after leaving Harvard, Stevenson became interested in the law again after talking to Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. When he returned home to Bloomington, he decided to finish his degree at Northwestern University School of Law, attending classes during the week and returning to Bloomington on the weekends to write for the Pantagraph. Stevenson received his J.D. degree from Northwestern in 1926 and passed the Illinois state bar examination that year. He obtained a position at Cutting, Moore & Sidley, one of Chicago's oldest and most prestigious law firms.\n\nSummary:\nAdlai Stevenson II spent his early life in Los Angeles, California, and Bloomington, Illinois.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "St", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "St", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Put it around the edge\n\nText continuation:\n...\nYou know, I think Wolfiesden has a point. If the purpose of the LED strip is to illuminate the animal head, it might be more effective to place it in a way that creates a subtle glow rather than a harsh, direct light. Maybe you could try placing it around the edges of the plaque or along the contours of the animal's body. This would create a soft, ambient light that adds depth and interest to the overall design without being too overpowering.\nAnother option would be to use a diffuser to soften the light emitted by the LED strip. This could be a transparent or translucent material that is placed over the strip to scatter the light and reduce its intensity. This would help to create a more subtle, even illumination that wouldn't be too overwhelming.\nOf course, if you're looking to make the LED strip more of a decoration, Wolfiesden's suggestion to place it around the edge of the plaque is a great idea. This would create a nice, subtle border that adds visual interest to the overall design without being too distracting. You could also consider using a different color or pattern for the LED strip to match the overall aesthetic of the plaque and animal head.\nUltimately, the key is to experiment and find the right balance between light and shadow. By playing around with different placements and intensities, you should be able to find a solution that works for your specific needs and creates a visually appealing display.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "To", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Put it around the edge\n\nText continuation:\n.  Think Bar rope lights.\nIf you are going eye-catcher but want subtle, don't put it on the front.  Make the mount so it stands off the wall an inch or so and angle the led strip outward and back so it illuminates the WALL around the plaque.  That would draw attention to it but not make it an in-your-face light making it hard to look into.  Here is the wall effect I am thinking:\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/01/a4/a7/01a4a71296c19077fe300113f7fe0eb5.jpg\n\nAnother option is to edge light plexi.  You would put a plexiglas plate between the head and the wood plate and edge light the plexiglass.  The plexi could be routed (standard router) with a design or if you have a laser cutter, plexi is extremely easy to cut and etch, expecially with a CO2 laser.  Mine cuts very quickly and etches very well.  Here is an edge lit sign to get an idea:\nhttp://www.valleydesignsnd.com/catalog/images/products/ac10212015_2.jpg\nAnother option to look at is tossing the LED thing and looking at EL wire.  Its very flexible, easy to work with and isn't extremely intense like LED is.  Is more of a subtle but distinctive look.  Doesn't put out much light so won't do anything for lighting up your head.  But for eyecandy effects, its hard to discount.  Its soft and flexible enough to be woven into clothes and has been used in halloween costumes for quite a few years now.  Here is an example off google (not endorsing this site, just has a decent pic): \nhttps://glowproducts.com/media/catalog/product/cache/5/thumbnail/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/e/l/el_wire_kits_gp2.jpg\nYusunoha: Thank you for your reply and all the information. \nTo quickly summarize the project that I have in mind, I have a giraffe animal head that I want to put on a plaque, and make it look like the imguraffe. Imgur is about the color green, so I had the idea of adding LED's to the plague that you can set to green.\nThe effect what I'm trying to go after though is having the head be illuminated in a dark room. Having the back of the plague is an option I considered, but I wanted to focus the light on the head than rather on the plague. And by diffusing the light you will not be directly staring into the light.\nI had not considered the edge lit option, I'll take it into consideration, but I think it may be a step too far for me.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "To", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The pope arrives to address U.S. bishops in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He spoke at a prayer service with U.S. bishops at Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Roman Catholic church in North America. Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a \"deep shame\" and called it \"gravely immoral behavior.\" \"Many of you have spoken to me of the enormous pain that your communities have suffered when clerics have betrayed ... their obligations,\" he told the bishops. Responding to the situation has not been easy and was sometimes very badly handled, the pope admitted.  Watch the pope address the issue \u00bb . \"It is vitally important that the vulnerable are always shielded from souls who would cause harm,\" he said. The pope then turned his attention to a different concern involving kids. \"What does it mean to speak of child protection when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many homes through media widely available today?\" he asked. Benedict urged the media and entertainment industry to take part in a \"moral renewal.\" Earlier Wednesday, President Bush, first lady Laura Bush and more than 13,500 spectators welcomed Benedict in an elaborate ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. In remarks greeting the pope to the White House, Bush called the United States \"a nation of prayer.\" Bush was interrupted by applause as he said, \"In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded, we need your message that all human life is sacred and that each of us is willed.\" Benedict responded by praising the role of religion in the United States. \"From the dawn of the republic, America's quest for freedom has been guided by the conviction that the principles governing political and social life are intimately linked to a moral order based on the dominion of God the creator,\" he said.  Watch Benedict talk about his hopes for the trip \u00bb . Earlier, a U.S. Marine Corps band performed the national anthem of the Holy See as well as \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" A fife and drum corps in Colonial costumes also played tunes, including \"Yankee Doodle,\" and soprano Kathleen Battle sang \"The Lord's Prayer.\" The day, with perfect spring weather, was also the pontiff's 81st birthday.  After the ceremony concluded, the crowd, led by Battle, serenaded Benedict with \"Happy Birthday\" as he smiled from a White House balcony.  Watch a priest who has known Benedict for years tell what he's like \u00bb . Guests on the South Lawn included Catholic clergy, ecumenical representatives, Catholic schoolchildren, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Sisters of the Poor and Knights of Columbus. Event planners faced an enormous demand for tickets for what White House press secretary Dana Perino called \"one of the largest arrival ceremonies ever held at the White House.\" Following the ceremony, Bush and the pope had a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office. The pope left the White House at about noon in his distinctive \"popemobile.\" His massive motorcade moved slowly down the wide avenues of the U.S. capital to the Vatican Embassy, where the pope is staying. Crowds of enthusiastic spectators waved U.S. and Vatican flags and screamed as the pontiff rode past. A smiling Benedict arrived Tuesday at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to cheers from a crowd of invited guests. The pontiff was greeted by Bush, the first lady and their daughter Jenna, each of whom shook his hand. It was believed to be the first time an American president has greeted a world dignitary on arrival at Andrews. It marks Benedict's first visit to the United States as pope.   Watch how the pope's visit could affect the presidential campaign \u00bb . Security will be tight during the six-day visit, with 27 state, local and federal agencies protecting the pope as he meets with religious leaders, celebrates Mass at two baseball stadiums and makes his way around in the popemobile. Benedict faces no specific threats, according to the FBI, but a March audio message from Osama bin Laden mentioned the pontiff. The centerpiece of the trip's Washington leg will be Thursday's Mass at Nationals Park, a new baseball stadium where 46,000 people will gather to see the pope. Everyone must go through metal detectors on entering, and nearby roads and bridges will be closed. Temporary flight restrictions will be in place over the stadium, and a 1\u00bd-mile section of the adjacent Anacostia River will be closed during the Mass. Benedict will travel to New York on Friday and address the U.N. General Assembly, linking the visit to the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He'll celebrate Mass on Sunday morning at Yankee Stadium.  Where will the pope be? \u00bb . One of the stated goals of the pope's visit is to energize the U.S. Catholic community with its estimated 70 million members. Three years after succeeding Pope John Paul II, Benedict is likely to also address the church's relationship with other faiths, the U.S.-led war in Iraq and the upcoming U.S. presidential election, said John Allen, a CNN Vatican analyst.

The pope arrives to address U.S. bishops in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He spoke at a prayer service with U.S. bishops at Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Roman Catholic church in North America. Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a \"deep shame\" and called it \"gravely immoral behavior.\" \"Many of you have spoken to me of the enormous pain that your communities have suffered when clerics have betrayed ... their obligations,\" he told the bishops. Responding to the situation has not been easy and was sometimes very badly handled, the pope admitted.  Watch the pope address the issue \u00bb . \"It is vitally important that the vulnerable are always shielded from souls who would cause harm,\" he said. The pope then turned his attention to a different concern involving kids. \"What does it mean to speak of child protection when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many homes through media widely available today?\" he asked. Benedict urged the media and entertainment industry to take part in a \"moral renewal.\" Earlier Wednesday, President Bush, first lady Laura Bush and more than 13,500 spectators welcomed Benedict in an elaborate ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. In remarks greeting the pope to the White House, Bush called the United States \"a nation of prayer.\" Bush was interrupted by applause as he said, \"In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded, we need your message that all human life is sacred and that each of us is willed.\" Benedict responded by praising the role of religion in the United States. \"From the dawn of the republic, America's quest for freedom has been guided by the conviction that the principles governing political and social life are intimately linked to a moral order based on the dominion of God the creator,\" he said.  Watch Benedict talk about his hopes for the trip \u00bb . Earlier, a U.S. Marine Corps band performed the national anthem of the Holy See as well as \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" A fife and drum corps in Colonial costumes also played tunes, including \"Yankee Doodle,\" and soprano Kathleen Battle sang \"The Lord's Prayer.\" The day, with perfect spring weather, was also the pontiff's 81st birthday.  After the ceremony concluded, the crowd, led by Battle, serenaded Benedict with \"Happy Birthday\" as he smiled from a White House balcony.  Watch a priest who has known Benedict for years tell what he's like \u00bb . Guests on the South Lawn included Catholic clergy, ecumenical representatives, Catholic schoolchildren, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Sisters of the Poor and Knights of Columbus. Event planners faced an enormous demand for tickets for what White House press secretary Dana Perino called \"one of the largest arrival ceremonies ever held at the White House.\" Following the ceremony, Bush and the pope had a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office. The pope left the White House at about noon in his distinctive \"popemobile.\" His massive motorcade moved slowly down the wide avenues of the U.S. capital to the Vatican Embassy, where the pope is staying. Crowds of enthusiastic spectators waved U.S. and Vatican flags and screamed as the pontiff rode past. A smiling Benedict arrived Tuesday at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to cheers from a crowd of invited guests. The pontiff was greeted by Bush, the first lady and their daughter Jenna, each of whom shook his hand. It was believed to be the first time an American president has greeted a world dignitary on arrival at Andrews. It marks Benedict's first visit to the United States as pope.   Watch how the pope's visit could affect the presidential campaign \u00bb . Security will be tight during the six-day visit, with 27 state, local and federal agencies protecting the pope as he meets with religious leaders, celebrates Mass at two baseball stadiums and makes his way around in the popemobile.

This is always their way of rejecting me instead of inviting me out.\nI\u2019m not introverted. I genuinely enjoy being around people and partying, drinking, having nights out, etc yet I end up spending most of my time going to bars, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, and the gym alone.\nI\u2019m not weak and I definitely have a bit of an attitude about me. I know how to say no to people and I\u2019m not afraid to let someone know when they\u2019ve done something wrong.\nBut I also know where to help\n\nText continuation:\n. I volunteer at a local animal shelter and I love it. It's a great way to get out of my comfort zone and do something that makes me feel good about myself. But even there, I don't really connect with anyone. I just go through the motions and get the job done.\nI've been thinking a lot about why I'm having such a hard time making friends. Is it because I'm too picky? Am I not putting myself out there enough? Do I just not have that \"friend-making\" gene? I've been trying to figure it out, but the more I think about it, the more confused I get.\nI've also been wondering if it's because I'm not \"cool\" enough. I mean, I like the same things as everyone else, but I'm not into the whole \"scene\" thing. I don't go to raves or concerts, and I don't have a fancy car or a trendy haircut. Am I just not \"cool\" enough for people to want to hang out with me?\nI've tried to put myself in other people's shoes and see things from their perspective. I've tried to be more understanding and less judgmental. But no matter what I do, I just can't seem to connect with anyone.\nI've been feeling really down about it lately. I feel like I'm just stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it. I've been thinking about talking to a therapist, but I'm not sure if that's the right step for me.\nI guess what I'm saying is that I'm just really frustrated and confused about why I can't make friends. I know I'm a good person, and I know I have a lot to offer. But for some reason, I just can't seem to connect with anyone.\nI'm not sure what the future holds, but I'm hoping that things will get better. I'm hoping that I'll find some people who share my interests and values, and that we'll be able to have some meaningful conversations and connections. I'm hoping that I'll be able to find a sense of belonging and community, and that I'll be able to feel like I'm a part of something bigger than myself.\nI know it's not going to be easy, but I'm willing to put in the work. I'm willing to keep trying and to keep pushing forward, even when it feels like nothing is working.

This is always their way of rejecting me instead of inviting me out.\nI\u2019m not introverted. I genuinely enjoy being around people and partying, drinking, having nights out, etc yet I end up spending most of my time going to bars, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, and the gym alone.\nI\u2019m not weak and I definitely have a bit of an attitude about me. I know how to say no to people and I\u2019m not afraid to let someone know when they\u2019ve done something wrong.\nBut I also know where to help\n\nText continuation:\npeople where they need it. I buy homeless people food and drinks. I also saw a coworker to their apartment after an incident that shook them the night beforehand (the coworker actually talked badly about me afterwards which I wasn\u2019t happy about)\nIt\u2019s extremely depressing. I know I need to be surrounded by people. I\u2019ve had to cut off my family too which isn\u2019t helping.\nIm genuinely exhausted of trying to make new friends should I just give up at this point?\nStrongWarmSweet: Do you have mental health problems? I\u2019m asking because you sound interesting, so it must be the opposite problem of being boring.\nAquaticUndercover: What kind of mental health problems? I have a lot of depression and I\u2019m still living with an ed and trauma lol that\u2019s bout it but idk if there\u2019s anything more?\nStrongWarmSweet: That\u2019s probably it. Unfortunately depression repels people\u2026 which only contributes to depression, obviously. That\u2019s probably why they are telling you to smile too. \nI am also depressed. Don\u2019t give up. Try just saying whatever comes to your head when you are around people (as long as it is polite). You may eventually find your people.\nAquaticUndercover: No they tell me to smile as a way of rejecting me. It\u2019s not obvious I\u2019m depressed\nStrongWarmSweet: How do you know that?\nAquaticUndercover: Just common sense\nStrongWarmSweet: Hmmm. I have never heard of that one tbh. I would take it as genuine feedback.\nAquaticUndercover: If they wanted to invite me out then they would\u2019ve right there instead of redirecting me\nStrongWarmSweet: Well yeah but I mean they may be rejecting you because they perceive you to be depressed. Unfortunately that can happen, which creates more depression. It can be a vicious cycle.\nAquaticUndercover: Maybe you are right but if I\u2019m depressed then surely the logical thing to do would be to make sure I\u2019m ok like inviting me out or smth idk. Even if I force a smile and I\u2019m more welcoming I don\u2019t feel like it makes me any closer to people usually they just feel like it\u2019s easier to ask me for favors :/\nStrongWarmSweet: Yeah I agree. People can be awful like that. I tend to have the same experience tbh. I have friends but not many and I tend to run into a lot of entitled people too. It is depressing. \nHave you tried meetups?\nAquaticUndercover: I\u2019ve sort of seen the app is it good?\nStrongWarmSweet: I have just a few friends. Two from back in high school that I see once or twice a year. One from uni I see monthly. One I met in a church group I see once or twice a year. Another I met on meetup that I see monthly. I am also in a relationship with someone I met in uni. But I recommend finding a few buddies before looking for a relationship because that\u2019s easier. \nSo yeah my go-to for myself is school, church and meet up apparently. Don\u2019t worry if the one-on-one hangouts are infrequent because over the years it ends up meaning something. \nMeet up is good because you can enjoy a hobby at the same time.

The only reason they exist is to be of material use to Homo sapiens. It makes sense for humans to care for these animals, though I understand modern food production is blurred with profit margins, unfortunately. Most farmers genuinely care for the livestock they manage. \nWhy would anyone look after cows if they have no end use? Because they\u2019re cute? What a joke... The only way to totally end cruelty to cows is for there to be no cows at\n\nText continuation:\nall. But what about the consequences of such a drastic change? Would we be willing to sacrifice the livelihoods of millions of farmers and their families, not to mention the impact on the environment and the economy? \nIt's not as simple as just abolishing livestock, as it would have far-reaching effects on our entire food system. We would need to find alternative sources of protein and nutrients, which could lead to unintended consequences such as increased reliance on industrial farming methods or the exploitation of other animal species. \nFurthermore, the idea that animals exist solely for human use is a simplistic view that neglects the complex relationships between humans and animals. Many animals have evolved alongside humans, and their existence has shaped our cultures, societies, and environments. The loss of these species would not only be a tragedy for the animals themselves but also for humanity. \nRather than seeking to eradicate livestock, perhaps we should focus on reevaluating our relationship with animals and the way we produce and consume food. We could strive for more sustainable and humane farming practices, such as regenerative agriculture, which prioritizes soil health, biodiversity, and animal welfare. \nThis approach would not only benefit the animals but also the environment, as it would promote soil carbon sequestration, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase ecosystem resilience. It would also support local communities and small-scale farmers, ensuring that the benefits of food production are shared equitably. \nIn conclusion, while the idea of a world without livestock animals may seem appealing at first glance, it is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of the consequences. Rather than seeking to eradicate animals, we should work towards a more compassionate and sustainable food system that prioritizes animal welfare, environmental stewardship, and social justice.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

We all need to try to buy local &amp; welfare quality assured produce. \nThe death of an animal is not a big deal. Poor treatment of them while they are alive is.\nTinac4: &gt; The death of an animal is not a big deal. Poor treatment of them while they are alive is.\nHow universally do you apply this principle?\nConsider a hypothetical human society where a number of kids are raised under the best possible conditions.  All of them are happy and satisfied, until they are killed painlessly and without warning at the age of 15.  Is this ethical?  If not, what makes this scenario different?\n[deleted]: Depends on your definition of 'ethics'. I argue that it wouldn't be unethical to kill 'isolately'. To kill any living being is 'fine' as long as their death does not inflict suffering on other living beings. For example, to kill a calf would be 'wrong' because their mother would suffer by cause of their death.\nHowever, if said calf existed in isolation and their death did not cause emotional or physical harm on others \u2013 and the procedure was to be done painlessly \u2013 I can see no problem with their murder. It does not matter if it is an individual of our species or another's.\nTinac4: I personally disagree--I'm more of a preference utilitarian than a classical utilitarian--but I see where you're coming from.  It does seem to me that your position leads to some unintuitive results, though.  For instance, if you came across a sleeping homeless man, you had a method to kill him painlessly and take his money, and you knew with certainty that nobody would care about or notice his death, would it be ethical to kill him?  (Obviously, this involves a lot of simplifications that don't apply in real life.)\n[deleted]: &gt; would it be ethical to kill him?\nI suppose we're having a mature discussion here so I'm going to answer honestly. Simply put, yes. But then again, that's according to MY definition of 'ethics' as I stated in the earlier comment.\nAs long as the procedure is done in a peaceful and painless manner, I really can't see how that would be a bad thing. It may help if I clarify that I'm an atheist who doesn't believe in afterlife, so to me death isn't anything gruesome.\nTinac4: Fair enough!  I think that the scenario you described would be bad, but only on the basis of my own ethical intuitions, and those intuitions definitely aren't universal.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Shame on those judgemental bums\nlightknight7777: I think it's important to understand that these people grew up being fed these answers by the government. It's easy to get mad at them,  but they're victims too. I can't imagine not being able to appreciate women and yet their society saw fit to rob them of that through ignorance and misdirection.

In the same way, the government and societal structures that perpetuate these beliefs about women are also responsible for creating an environment that is hostile towards them. We can't just focus on the individuals who carry out these actions, but also the systems and institutions that enable and perpetuate them.\nAs we continue to discuss this topic, it's essential to recognize that the issue of misogyny and oppression is deeply rooted in societal structures and power dynamics. It's not just about individual people, but about the systems and institutions that perpetuate these beliefs and actions.\nIn the case of Najmia, she is a victim of these societal structures, but she is also a symbol of resistance and defiance. Her decision to not wear her hijab despite being harassed is a powerful statement against the oppressive norms that seek to control her and other women. It's a reminder that women have the power to resist and challenge these norms, and that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.\nAs we move forward, it's crucial that we continue to have these conversations and challenge the societal structures that perpetuate misogyny and oppression. We need to recognize that these issues are complex and multifaceted, and that they require a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of these problems.\nUltimately, it's up to us to create a society that values and respects all individuals, regardless of their gender, race, religion, or any other characteristic. We need to work towards a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential, free from the constraints of oppressive societal structures.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "We", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Shame on those judgemental bums\nlightknight7777: I think it's important to understand that these people grew up being fed these answers by the government. It's easy to get mad at them,  but they're victims too. I can't imagine not being able to appreciate women and yet their society saw fit to rob them of that through ignorance and misdirection. Women absolutely have it worse, but direct your anger at the government and programs that made them this way, first and foremost.\nSakuraba85: Would you say the same thing about Hitler?\nlightknight7777: Hitler formed the society that overthrew\n\nText continuation:\nthe previous system and installed his insane beliefs. I would say the children in Hitler youth were first generation victims. \nYou don't get to be a victim of the system when you installed it.\nWhat's more is a bully who was made a bully by the system is still a bully.  You can be a victim and also an asshole. You can be mad at Hitler and the environment that raised him. But Hitler had access to different viewpoints and picked the one he arrived at despite education. These kids don't have that luxury. When someone disagrees,  men with sticks show up and beat the hell out of them.\nSakuraba85: What do you mean? Hitler was shaped by his education and upbringing just like these men. \nHe grew up with being ashamed of how Germany acted and was treated after WW1 and was taught about that in school and his society.\nlightknight7777: The reason Hitler was evil wasn't him being mad at how Germany was treated.  It wasn't even him wanting to make Germany powerful again.  Conquerers have existed all throughout history without being known from then on as evil.  It was the \"genocide\" bit that made him the image of evil. Out of a plethora of perfectly viable options, he decided on concentration camps and murder. \nThere's a massive difference between being raised to think something bad is \"the truth\" vs specifically seeking out something bad to believe in from options. He arrived at his particular brand of insanity after significant research and adult social circles. You can be mad at him even having that path to come to. Heck, antisemitism was super common at the time (even in the US), but him going \"therefore let's remove them\" was  on him. Every other government was managing to not round them up and murder them.\nSakuraba85: Ok, i understand. It\u2019s not evil wanting to hang children because they don\u2019t want to have fabric on their heads. Got it. It\u2019s not their fault.\nlightknight7777: As I stated,  a bully who was made a bully by their system is still a bully. Them espousing the evil beliefs they were taught is still bad but they are also victims as well. \nWhat you don't seem to be accepting is my primary point that the system that produces evil is more evil than the individuals.

The train, inaugurated in 1946, originally ran from Cincinnati, Ohio, to New Orleans, Louisiana, via Louisville, Nashville, Birmingham, Montgomery and Mobile and later via a connection at Bowling Green, Kentucky, to Memphis, Tennessee. A connection to Chicago was provided by the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad.\nThe Humming Bird had separate sections in the north and the south. The main northern part originated in Cincinnati; other sections (of the L&N's Georgian) originated in St. Louis and from Chicago. These sections linked with the main part of the train in Nashville. At Bowling Green, Kentucky, a southwest-bound section broke off, bound for Memphis; whereas the main southern route continued south to\n\nText continuation:\nMobile, Alabama, where it connected with the Gulf Coast Limited, a train operated by the Illinois Central Railroad.\nThe Humming Bird was known for its luxurious accommodations, including sleeping cars, dining cars, and observation cars. The train featured a distinctive silver and blue color scheme, with a logo featuring a hummingbird, which was a symbol of the railroad. The train was also famous for its on-board amenities, including fine dining, entertainment, and comfortable sleeping quarters.\nAs the years went by, the Humming Bird continued to operate, with occasional changes to its route and schedule. In the 1960s, the train was modified to include air-conditioned cars, and in the 1970s, it was upgraded to include diesel locomotives. Despite these changes, the Humming Bird remained a popular choice for travelers, particularly those looking for a comfortable and convenient way to travel between the Midwest and the Gulf Coast.\nIn the 1980s, the Humming Bird was merged with other trains operated by the L&N, and it was eventually discontinued in the 1990s. However, its legacy lives on, with many railroad enthusiasts still fondly remembering the train's luxurious accommodations and scenic route. Today, the Humming Bird is remembered as a symbol of the golden age of American rail travel, a time when trains were the primary mode of transportation and the railroad was a vital part of the country's infrastructure.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Train 6 was the northbound number.\nThe original equipment was part of a 28-car order of four train sets of lightweight stainless steel cars built in 1946 by ACF. Fourteen cars were assigned to the Humming Bird and fourteen to the Georgian. Many of those cars were removed from service in the late 1960s due to severe corrosion problems.\nThe L&N Railroad served the old Union Station in Memphis, until its closure on April 1, 1964.

At that time, the L&N Railroad earned some unwanted publicity when it terminated the final run of the train en route southbound at Birmingham when a federal judge lifted the order keeping the train running after the Interstate Commerce Commission approved its permanent discontinuance.

However, user-defined operators\n\nText continuation:\nare difficult to implement language constructs involving static name binding. Name binding is association between names and values (or memory locations). Our inquiry is whether we can design a system for user-defined operators involving a new custom name binding. This paper proposes a module system for user-defined operators named a dsl class. A dsl class is similar to a normal class in Java but it contains operators instead of methods. We use operators for implementing custom name binding. For example, we use a nullary operator for emulating a variable name. An instance of a dsl class, called a dsl object, reifies an environment that expresses name binding. Programmers can control a scope of instance operators by specifying where the dsl object is active. We extend the host type system so that it can express the activation of a dsl object. In our system, a bound name is propagated through a type parameter to a dsl object. This enables us to implement user-defined language constructs involving static name binding. A contribution of this paper is that we reveal we can integrate a system for managing names and their scopes with a module and type system of an object-oriented language like Java. This allows us to implement a proposed system by adopting eager disambiguation based on expected types so that the compilation time will be acceptable. Eager disambiguation, which prunes out semantically invalid abstract parsing trees (ASTs) while a parser is running, is needed because the parser may generate a huge number of potentially valid ASTs for the same source code. We have implemented ProteaJ2, which is a programming language based on Java and it supports our proposal. We describe a parsing method that adopts eager disambiguation for fast parsing and discuss its time complexity. To show the practicality of our proposal, we have conducted two micro benchmarks to see the performance of our compiler. We also show several use cases of dsl classes for demonstrating dsl classes can express various language constructs. Our ultimate goal is to let programmers add any kind of new language construct to a host language. To do this, programmers should be able to define new syntax, name binding, and type system within the host language. This paper shows programmers can define the former two: their own syntax and name binding.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "Yes", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "To", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "Yes", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

We adapt the approach of Dennis Sullivan, which treats a spin structure on a Riemann surface M as a complex line bundle S whose square is the canonical line bundle K=T(M). Given a conformal immersion of M into \\bbR^3, the unique spin strucure on S^2 pulls back via the Gauss map to a spin structure S on M, and gives rise to a pair of smooth sections (s_1,s_2) of S. Conversely, any pair of sections of S generates a (possibly periodic) conformal immersion of M under a suitable integrability condition, which for a minimal surface is simply that the spinor sections are meromorphic. A spin structure S also determines (and is determined by) the regular homotopy class of the immersion by way of a \\bbZ_2-quadratic\n\nText continuation:\n.\nThis spinor representation provides a powerful tool for studying conformal immersions of Riemann surfaces into space. By analyzing the properties of the spinor sections, we can gain insight into the geometry and topology of the immersion. For example, the meromorphicity of the spinor sections is closely related to the existence of a conformal metric on the surface, and the regular homotopy class of the immersion is determined by the spin structure.\nFurthermore, the spinor representation can be used to study the relationship between conformal immersions and other geometric objects, such as holomorphic curves and harmonic maps. For instance, a holomorphic curve in \\bbC^2 can be viewed as a conformal immersion of a Riemann surface into \\bbC^2, and the spinor representation can be used to study the properties of this immersion.\nIn addition, the spinor representation has applications in other areas of mathematics and physics, such as the study of topological invariants and the classification of conformal field theories. The spinor representation provides a powerful tool for studying these topics, and has been used to make important advances in these areas.\nIn conclusion, the spinor representation is a powerful tool for studying conformal immersions of Riemann surfaces into space. By analyzing the properties of the spinor sections, we can gain insight into the geometry and topology of the immersion, and the spinor representation can be used to study the relationship between conformal immersions and other geometric objects.

We adapt the approach of Dennis Sullivan, which treats a spin structure on a Riemann surface M as a complex line bundle S whose square is the canonical line bundle K=T(M). Given a conformal immersion of M into \\bbR^3, the unique spin strucure on S^2 pulls back via the Gauss map to a spin structure S on M, and gives rise to a pair of smooth sections (s_1,s_2) of S. Conversely, any pair of sections of S generates a (possibly periodic) conformal immersion of M under a suitable integrability condition, which for a minimal surface is simply that the spinor sections are meromorphic. A spin structure S also determines (and is determined by) the regular homotopy class of the immersion by way of a \\bbZ_2-quadratic\n\nText continuation:\nform q_S. We present an analytic expression for the Arf invariant of q_S, which decides whether or not the correponding immersion can be deformed to an embedding. The Arf invariant also turns out to be an obstruction, for example, to the existence of certain complete minimal immersions. The later parts of this paper use the spinor representation to investigate minimal surfaces with embedded planar ends. In general, we show for a spin structure S on a compact Riemann surface M with punctures at P that the space of all such (possibly periodic) minimal immersions of M\\setminus P into \\bbR^3 (upto homothety) is the the product of S^1\\times H^3 with the Grassmanian of 2-planes in a complex vector space \\calK of meromorphic sections of S. An important tool -- a skew-symmetric form \\Omega defined by residues of a certain meromorphic quadratic differential on M -- lets us compute how \\calK varies as M and P are varied. Then we apply this to determine the moduli spaces of planar-ended minimal spheres and real projective planes, and also to construct a new family of minimal tori and a minimal Klein bottle with 4 ends. These surfaces compactify in S^3 to yield surfaces critical for the \\Moebius invariant squared mean curvature functional W. On the other hand, Robert Bryant has shown all W-critical spheres and real projective planes arise this way. Thus we find at the same time the moduli spaces of W-critical spheres and real projective planes via the spinor representation.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "and", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Both", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, pictured late last month during a visit to France. The attack happened while the plane was about to take off from Mogadishu's airport Sunday around 11 a.m. local time, spokesman Hussien Mohammed Huubsireb said. \"Al-Shaabab has actually tried to harm to president, but thank God nobody was hurt,\" Huubsireb said. Al-Shaabab is an Islamic militia that is trying to seize control of Somalia. It is a splinter group of the Islamic Courts Union, which ousted Somalia's transitional government in 2006. The ICU was deposed in December of that year following Ethiopia's military invasion. Bloody battles between Al-Shaabab and the Ethiopian-backed government forces in Mogadishu have forced residents to flee the capital. More than 40,000 displaced civilians have taken shelter in dozens of makeshift settlements west of Mogadishu, described by the United Nations as \"precarious conditions.\" Sunday's mortar attack is the second assassination attempt on Ahmed. The president survived a car bombing in September 2006 outside Somalia's parliament in Baidoa that killed at least eight others. Somalia's Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi has been more frequently targeted by the Islamic insurgents seeking to destabilize the government. Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. Somalia's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital, with the help of the better-equipped Ethiopian forces. But the presence of the Ethiopians has united various Islamic militant groups in Somalia, including Al-Shaabab, who are trying to oust the Ethiopian forces and gain control of Mogadishu. The United States classified Al-Shaabab as a terrorist organization in March, partly because of what Washington says is the group's close ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda militant group.\n\nSummary:\nSuspected Islamic insurgents fired mortar rounds at Somalia's transitional president's plane.\nNo one was harmed, including President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, according to his spokesman.\nThis is the second assassination attempt on Ahmed, who survived a car bombing in 2006.\nAl-Shaabab, an Islamic militia, is seeking to seize control of Somalia and destabilize the government.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "(Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "I"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Z", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The queen's birthday is actually April 21, but she officially celebrates it every year on a Saturday in June when good weather is more likely, according to Buckingham Palace. During the ceremony, which is open to the public, the queen inspects the troops. They then march past the queen, who rides in a carriage back to the palace. The Royal Air Force then conducts a colorful fly-past over Buckingham Palace while the queen and her family watch from the balcony. The queen has attended Trooping the Color every year of her reign except for one -- 1955, when a national rail strike canceled the event, the palace says. The ceremony gets its name from a tradition where colors of the battalion were carried, or \"trooped,\" down the ranks so they could be seen and recognized by the soldiers, Buckingham Palace says.\n\nSummary:\nQueen Elizabeth celebrates her 82nd birthday with a parade and military ceremony, \"Trooping the Color\", in London.\nThe ceremony is open to the public and features a colorful fly-past by the Royal Air Force.\nThe queen inspects the troops and watches from the balcony as they march past her.\nThe ceremony has been held every year of her reign, except for 1955 due to a national rail strike.\n\n\nPlease respond with only \"Yes\" or \"No\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "answer_neut": "No", "steered": {"layer12_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Note"}, "layer12_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "It", "answer_neg": "#"}, "layer13_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer13_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer13_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}, "layer12,13,14_mult2": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "No", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult8": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "No"}, "layer12,13,14_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "No", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "Yes"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the word \"Yes\" or \"No\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.
