It uses electrical scattering matrices and noise wave vectors to describe receiver architectures of arbitrary topology and complexity. It differs from existing freely-available software mainly in that the scattering matrices used to describe the receiver and its components are analytic rather than numeric. This allows different types of modeling and analysis of receivers to be performed. Non-ideal behavior of receiver components can be parameterized in their scattering matrices. SNS enables the instrument designer to then derive analytic expressions for the signal and noise at the receiver outputs in terms of parameterized component imperfections, and predict their contribution to receiver\n\nText continuation:\nsystematic errors precisely. This can drive the receiver design process by, for instance, allowing the instrument designer to identify which component imperfections contribute most to receiver systematic errors, and hence place firm specifications on individual components. Using SNS to perform this analysis is preferable to traditional Jones matrix-based analysis as it includes internal reflections and is able to model noise: two effects which Jones matrix analysis is unable to describe. SNS can be used to model any receiver in which the components can be described by scattering matrices. Of particular interest to the sub-mm and terahertz frequency regime is the choice between coherent and direct detection technologies. Steady improvements in mm and sub-mm Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) mean that coherent receivers with LNAs as their first active element are becoming increasingly competitive, in terms of sensitivity, with bolometer-based receivers at frequencies above ~100 GHz. As an example of the utility of SNS, we use it to compare two polarimeter architectures commonly used to perform measurements of the polarized Cosmic Microwave Background: differencing polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in polarization sensitive bolometer-based polarimeters; and pseudo-correlation polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in coherent, LNA-based, polarimeters. We parameterize common sources of receiver systematic errors in both architectures and compare them through their Mueller matrices, which encode how well the instruments measure the Stokes parameters of the incident radiation. These analytic Mueller matrices are used to demonstrate the different sources of systematic errors in differencing and correlation polarimeters.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

It added that the action was designed to save about $375m (\u00c2\u00a3236m) a year.\nThe move follows a period of turmoil at the firm.\nCarol Bartz was dismissed as chief executive in September after failing to turn around the company's fortunes. Chairman Roy Bostock and co-founder Jerry Yang also later resigned from its board.\nIn January, former Paypal executive Scott Thompson was named the organisation's fourth chief executive in five years.\nA recent study by the analytics company Comscore suggested that Yahoo's share of online search queries in the USfell below 14% for the first time in February, putting it further behind Google and Microsoft.\nA statement issued by Mr Thompson's said: \"We are intensifying our efforts on our core businesses and redeploying resources to our most urgent priorities. Our goal is to get back to our core purpose -putting our users and advertisers first - and we are moving aggressively to achieve that goal.\"\nIt added that the firm would now focus on a \"deep\" personalised experience for users and a return on investment for investors.\nThe firm has not given any indication of when the cuts would be made. It said it would provide more information about its \"future direction\" when it released an earnings update on 17 April.\nAs Yahoo shrinks, Skype is growing. Once all the new positions are filled, the business expects to have 1,600 employees worldwide.\nAs part of the expansion it is launching a new technology centre in central London. It says the move would increase its headcount in the city by 40% to 330 posts.\nThe UK government's desire to monitor people using its services did not influence Skype's decision\nIt aims to have completed the first stage of the hiring process by the end of June.\nSkype's vice-president of product and design told the BBC the new jobs would cover software engineering, product management and design.\n\"We have one project about 'big data', which is about making use of data that our users generate when using the product to improve the quality of the products we offer,\" said Rick Osterloh.\n\"We also a number of initiatives we are working on in the web area, and we are hiring some positions for our newly formed Xbox division.\"\nSkype's move signals that it is not overly concerned about the UK government's intention to give the country's security services increased access to internet data.\nDeputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has specifically identified Skype as one of the services that the government wants to be monitored.\nA statement from Skype said that: \"We are not in a position to comment on the UK government's proposed legislation. We do of course comply with legislation in all countries in which we operate.\"\nSkype's use of peer-to-peer technology for its call and instant-messaging services means that it does not store the contents of communications on its servers, and so could not hand the information over unless it changed its systems.\n\nSummary:\nYahoo has confirmed it is axing about 2,000 posts, which amounts to 14% of its workforce being laid off.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Sk", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Biometric systems which are intended to be used solely for the purpose of enabling cybersecurity and personal data protection measures should not be considered as high risk systems. As regards the management and operation of critical infrastructure, it is appropriate to classify as high-risk the AI systems intended to be used as safety components in the management and operation of critical digital infrastructure as listed in Annex I point 8 of the Directive on the resilience of critical entities, road traffic and the supply of water, gas, heating and electricity, since their failure or malfunctioning may put at risk the life and health\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Atomic and molecular line emissions from shocks may provide valuable information on the injection of mechanical energy in the interstellar medium (ISM), the generation of turbulence, and the processes of phase transition between the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) and the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM).Aims. In this series of papers, we investigate the properties of shocks propagating in the WNM. Our objective is to identify the tracers of these shocks, use them to interpret ancillary observations of the local diffuse matter, and provide predictions for future observations. Methods. Shocks propagating in the WNM are studied using the Paris-Durham shock code, a multi-fluid model built to follow the thermodynamical and chemical structures of shock waves, at steady-state, in a plane-parallel geometry\n\nText continuation:\n.\nResults. The simulations reveal that the shocks are characterized by a complex interplay between the thermal and chemical structures, which in turn affect the emission properties of the gas. We find that the shocks produce a range of emission lines, including those of atomic and molecular species, which can be used as tracers of the shock properties. The simulations also suggest that the shocks can lead to the formation of dense, clumpy structures, which can be the precursors of star-forming regions.\nDiscussion. The results of our simulations have important implications for our understanding of the role of shocks in the ISM. The shocks can inject significant amounts of mechanical energy into the gas, which can drive the formation of turbulence and the generation of complex structures. The emission lines produced by the shocks can be used as a diagnostic tool to study the properties of the shocks and the surrounding gas. Furthermore, the simulations suggest that the shocks can play a key role in the formation of star-forming regions, by providing the necessary conditions for the collapse of dense gas.\nFuture Work. In future studies, we plan to explore the effects of the shocks on the surrounding gas in more detail, including the formation of dense structures and the injection of mechanical energy. We will also investigate the role of the shocks in the formation of star-forming regions, and explore the potential for using the emission lines produced by the shocks as a diagnostic tool to study the properties of the ISM.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

AMC's \"Mad Men\" and FX's \"Damages\" made Emmy history Thursday as the first basic-cable series to be nominated for best drama. The pair, which had made the 10-series Emmy shortlist, have been widely hailed by critics and have received good ratings for basic-cable series -- though \"Damages\" star Glenn Close said she hopes the Emmys help boost the show's audience. \"We need all the help we can get,\" she told The Associated Press. On the other hand, HBO's \"The Wire\" -- which concluded its fifth and final season this year -- once again came up empty in the best drama nominations. It did receive one nod, for writing. The series, though much praised and dissected by a hard-core group of fans, has received little recognition from the Emmys, with just one previous nomination -- also for writing -- in 2005.  Check out some of the top Emmy nods this year \u00bb . Indeed, HBO has struggled to find a drama to take the place of the much-lauded \"The Sopranos,\" which won best drama last year after a storied run. \"Mad Men,\" which has made AMC into a player, was allegedly turned down by the cable giant, and shows such as the quickly canceled \"John From Cincinnati\" and \"Rome\" haven't had the same impact. On the other hand, \"In Treatment\" received a nomination for Gabriel Byrne's performance as a therapist, and the network's comedies, particularly \"Entourage,\" have performed strongly. Moreover, the network's short-form programming, such as the miniseries \"John Adams\" and the TV movie \"Recount,\" dominated their Emmy categories: \"John Adams\" led all nominees with 23 nominations, and \"Recount,\" about the 2000 presidential election battle, received 11. \"The network has made up for [its lack of drama series success] in other forms,\" Variety TV editor Michael Schneider told CNN. \"It's still the most nominated network and has the most nominated program.\" HBO led all networks with 85 nominations. Among broadcast networks, ABC led with 76 nominations. Among regularly scheduled TV series, \"30 Rock\" earned 17 nominations and \"Mad Men\" received 16. The 17 nominations for \"30 Rock\" were a record number in a single year for a comedy series. Newcomer \"Pushing Daisies,\" the whimsical series on ABC, received 12 nominations. Given that the show only aired nine episodes -- and hasn't been on the air in months due to the writers strike -- its recognition was a surprise, Schneider said. \"It was nice that voters still remembered it,\" he said. Along with \"Damages\" and \"Mad Men,\" nominees for best drama include \"Boston Legal,\" \"Dexter,\" \"House\" and \"Lost.\" Comedy series nominees are \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Entourage,\" \"The Office,\" \"30 Rock\" and \"Two and a Half Men.\" Cable series dominated the dramatic acting nominations, with four of the six actors and three of the five actresses appearing on basic or pay cable. Best actor in a drama nominees are Byrne (\"In Treatment\"), Bryan Cranston (\"Breaking Bad\"), Michael C. Hall (\"Dexter\"), Jon Hamm (\"Mad Men\"), Hugh Laurie (\"House\") and James Spader (\"Boston Legal\"). \"Dexter,\" which originated on Showtime, earned a short run on CBS following the writers strike. The nominees for best actress in a drama are Close (\"Damages\"), Sally Field (\"Brothers and Sisters\"), Mariska Hargitay (\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\"), Holly Hunter (\"Saving Grace\") and Kyra Sedgwick (\"The Closer\"). A number of familiar names were included among nominees for comedies. The nominees for best actor in a comedy are Alec Baldwin (\"30 Rock\"), Steve Carell (\"The Office\"), Lee Pace (\"Pushing Daisies\"), Tony Shalhoub (\"Monk\") and Charlie Sheen (\"Two and a Half Men\"). Only Pace is a newcomer. The nominees for best actress in a comedy are Christina Applegate (\"Samantha Who?\"), America Ferrera (\"Ugly Betty\"), Tina Fey (\"30 Rock\"), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (\"The New Adventures of Old Christine\") and Mary-Louise Parker (\"Weeds\"). Sarah Silverman earned three nominations, all for different programs: one for a guest shot on \"Monk,\" another for contributing to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and a third for producing her own \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\" Kristin Chenoweth, Neil Patrick Harris and TV academy Chairman John Shaffner announced the nominations Thursday. Chenoweth was particularly bubbly, throwing in a non sequitur about once dating \"Survivor\" host Jeff Probst and declining to sing \"Happy Birthday\" because \"the Emmys can't afford me to sing that song\" due to licensing arrangements. Both Chenoweth (\"Pushing Daisies\") and Harris (\"How I Met Your Mother\") were nominated in supporting actor categories. Two highly rated shows, \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Desperate Housewives,\" were snubbed. \"Grey's,\" a regular nominee for best drama, was left off that list, though star Sandra Oh was nominated for best supporting actress. \"Housewives,\" which won six Emmys its debut season, was ignored in both best comedy series and best actress in a comedy series categories. Two guest stars did receive nominations.

No excuses.\nPlankLengthIsNull: Speaking a former cook, I can assure you not a single person in that establish gave a shit, nor was your absence noticed.\ncasra888: And, why should I care what a cook thinks???\nI only care what I do with my money.\ngeazleel: You sound like a real charmer\ncasra888: I'm honest and I expect to get what I pay for.\nYou're the whiny child who is crying about my walking out of a restaurant that can't keep hair out of its food.\nYou tried to play off like I'm a nobody. Fine, I keep my money.\nBut, always remember, you're just a cook who doesn't care about health standards\n\nText continuation:\ncasra888: And don't even get me started on the whole \"I'm just a cook\" thing. You think that's an excuse? Newsflash, buddy: as a customer, I don't care what your job title is. What I care about is the service I receive, and if that includes a side of hair with my meal, then I'm outta there. And don't try to spin it as me being some kind of \"entitled\" customer. I'm not entitled to anything except for what I pay for, and if that's not good enough for you, then maybe you should rethink your business model.\nPlankLengthIsNull: Oh, spare me the drama. You're just a customer who can't handle a little bit of hair in their food. Get over it.\ncasra888: A little bit of hair? You're the one who's being dramatic. I'm talking about a hair that's literally in my food. That's not just a little bit of hair, that's a health hazard. And don't try to downplay it by saying it's just a little bit of hair. You know as well as I do that food safety is a serious issue, and if you're not taking it seriously, then maybe you shouldn't be running a restaurant.\ngeazleel: Wow, you're really passionate about this. Maybe you should start a blog or something.\ncasra888: Ha! You think I'm passionate about this? You have no idea. I'm just fed up with the lack of accountability in this industry. Restaurants think they can get away with anything and still expect customers to keep coming back. Well, not me. I'll take my business elsewhere, and I'll make sure to tell all my friends and family about the horrible experience I had at your dump.\nPlankLengthIsNull: Oh, great, now you're threatening to ruin our reputation. Go ahead, try it. See how far you get.\ncasra888: I'm not threatening anything. I'm just telling you how it is. And if you don't like it, then maybe you should start taking your customers seriously. Because right now, it's clear that you don't care about anything except for your own ego and your own profits. Well, I'm not going to be a part of that.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nMotivation. Association studies have been widely used to search for associations between common genetic variants observations and a given phenotype. However, it is now generally accepted that genes and environment must be examined jointly when estimating phenotypic variance. In this work we consider two types of biological markers: genotypic markers, which characterize an observation in terms of inherited genetic information, and metagenomic marker which are related to the environment. Both types of markers are available in their millions and can be used to characterize any observation uniquely. Objective. Our focus is on detecting interactions between groups of genetic and metagenomic markers in order to gain a better understanding of the complex relationship between environment and genome\n\nText continuation:\nin the expression of a given phenotype. Contributions. We propose a novel approach for efficiently detecting interactions between complementary datasets in a high-dimensional setting with a reduced computational cost. The method, named SICOMORE, reduces the dimension of the search space by selecting a subset of supervariables in the two complementary datasets. These supervariables are given by a weighted group structure defined on sets of variables at different scales. A Lasso selection is then applied on each type of supervariable to obtain a subset of potential interactions that will be explored via linear model testing. Results. We compare SICOMORE with other approaches in simulations, with varying sample sizes, noise, and numbers of true interactions. SICOMORE exhibits convincing results in terms of recall, as well as competitive performances with respect to running time. The method is also used to detect interaction between genomic markers in Medicago truncatula and metagenomic markers in its rhizosphere bacterial community. Software availability.

The country's distinctive group of Moroccan Arabic dialects is referred to as Darija. Approximately 89.8% of the whole population can communicate to some degree in Moroccan Arabic. The Berber language is spoken in three dialects (Tarifit, Tashelhit and Central Atlas Tamazight). In 2008, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Deroche estimated that there were 12 million Berber speakers, making up about 40% of the population. The 2004 population census reported that 28.1% of the population spoke Berber.\nFrench is widely used in governmental institutions, media, mid-size and large companies, international commerce with French-speaking countries, and often in international diplomacy. French is taught as an obligatory language in all schools.

Lewis Hamilton will be able to afford a lot more champagne in the future. The Briton is set to become one of the most marketable sport stars in the world -- perhaps second only to Tiger Woods -- and earn more than a billion dollars if he can maintain the buzz created by his first season in Formula One, experts say. On Sunday he started his second season in perfect fashion, easily winning the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. The 23-year-old signed a five-year contract with McLaren worth an estimated $140m in January. It leaves him lagging along way behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who is paid an estimated $50m a year for driving, but it is through endorsements that he stands to reap a greater windfall. Stephen Cheliotis, chief executive of the Centre for Brand Analysis and UK Superbrands and CoolBrands Councils' chairman, said Hamilton was the most marketable driver because he was a breath of fresh air. He had helped drive up race attendance and television fewer figures dramatically in his first season. \"He is young, mixing with the right people everyday -- rappers, film stars -- and a lot more articulate than Kimi Raikkonen,\" Cheliotis said. \"He is also the first black driver and it does have a bearing, much like Tiger Woods in golf. He is also the most marketable because he is going to be the best, much like Michael Schumacher.\" Pippa Collett, Sponsorship Consulting's managing director, said Hamilton was certainly the most marketable driver in the short term. His performance meant he was the dominant member of a group of \"young turks\" -- Nelson Piquet Jr, Nico Rosberg, Heikki Kovalainen -- who had great potential. Collett said in terms of the media Hamilton's performance, friendliness, English speaking background and professionalism were key assets. If he could maintain these he would earn more than Schumacher -- the sport's first billionaire driver. Indeed, Schumacher set an example which Hamilton would be wise to follow. He was the first driver to win personal sponsors after Ferrari allowed him to sign a $10m annual deal with a German bank to place its logo on his cap. The German also actively pursued the development of his own retail range, which included caps -- he sold hundreds of thousands at $30 a pop -- and even a branded vacuum cleaner. Collett said Schumacher's manager, Willi Weber, was very good. \"Schumacher was a nice guy but not very charming. However, he was very professional and you knew he would turn up,\" Collett said. Cheliotis agreed Hamilton would earn considerably more than Schumacher, and that there would be a big gap between his earnings and that of the other drivers. However, there were pitfalls. Lewis had already made the mistake of saying he was moving to Switzerland to avoid the limelight when it was all about avoiding tax, Cheliotis said. \"He said that and then turned up at every awards night for a month.\" Cheliotis said appearing arrogant, being caught out by the tabloid press, endorsing a brand and then using another and over selling himself could also damage his value. \"The big danger with someone like Hamilton is that he is so in demand and that he has so many sponsors it leads to brand confusion. There is a danger of being one of 50 sponsors and not getting any value.\" Collett said Hamilton needed to develop his \"life-time brand\". While Raikkonen may not be a media darling he had developed an \"Iceman\" image, which was just as important in the long term. English footballer David Beckham, whose performance had dropped off, had successfully developed a life-time brand that would out last his playing career. Collett said Hamilton's one weakness may be his father, Anthony. \"His dad is his manager. Your brand positioning is as an individual... having your dad around too much could affect your brand.\" Collett said Hamilton would have to be wary of bad press, but a little bit of young turk behaviour could enhance his image as long as he continued to excel. \"I think that is part of the glamour... some of that and continued brilliant performances will make his life very easy.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nSummary:\nExperts say Lewis Hamilton is set to earn more than Michael Schumacher\nDavid Beckham's \"life-time brand\" provides valuable lessons\nA little bit of scandal is good for the bank balance\nRaikkonen's \"Iceman\" persona allows sponsors to find perfect match\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Good", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations. Half of the continuations contain people's names and half don't, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nChoosing the Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) ternary alloy for thin films solar cells might yield high benefits concerning efficiency and reliability, because its bandgap can be tuned through the Indium composition and radiations have little destructive effect on it. It may also reveal challenges because good quality p-doped InGaN layers are difficult to elaborate. In this letter, a new design for an InGaN thin film solar cell is optimized, where the player of a PIN structure is replaced by a Schottky contact, leading to a Metal-IN (MIN) structure. With a simulated efficiency of 19.8%, the MIN structure performs better than the previously studied Schottky structure, while increasing its fabrication tolerance and thus functional reliability a. Owing to its good tolerance to radiations [1], its\n\nText continuation:\nhigh light absorption [2, 3] and its Indium-composition-tuned bandgap [4, 5], the Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) ternary alloy is a good candidate for high-efficiency-high-reliability solar cells able to operate in harsh environments. Unfortunately, InGaN p-doping is still a challenge, owing to InGaN residual n-doping [6], the lack of dedicated ac-ceptors [7] and the complex fabrication process itself [8, 9]. To these drawbacks can be added the uneasy fabrication of ohmic contacts [4] and the difficulty to grow the high-quality-high-Indium-content thin films [10] which would be needed to cover the whole solar spectrum. These drawbacks still prevent InGaN solar cells to be competitive with other well established III-V and silicon technologies [11]. In this letter, is proposed a new Metal-IN (MIN) InGaN solar cell structure where the InGaN p-doped layer is removed and replaced by a Schottky contact, lifting one of the above mentioned drawbacks. A set of realistic physical models based on actual measurements is used to simulate and optimize its behavior and performance using mathematically rigorous multi-criteria optimization methods, aiming to show that both efficiency and fabrication tolerances are better than the previously described simple InGaN Schottky solar cell [12].\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nThe influence of cooling rate on the intensity of thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) and the necessity to correct archaeo/palaeointensities for this effect have long been recognized. However the reliability of the correction is still questioned. We studied 35 bricks baked in two modern kilns (SK and BK) in known experimental conditions and with measurements of the direction and intensity of the geomagnetic field at the site. The smallest kiln (SK, 0.2 m 3) cooled in around 12 hours and the biggest kiln (BK, 8 m 3) in around 40 hours. Thermomagnetic, hysteresis and backfield curves indicated that the main magnetic carriers were Ti-poor titanomagnetites and Tipoortitanohematites. The fraction of the TRM carried by Ti-poor titanohematites is the maindifference between the two sets of bricks. This\n\nText continuation:\nfraction is around 5-10% in bricks from BK kilnand up to 40% in those from SK kiln. Intensities of the Earth's magnetic field were determinedusing the original Thellier-Thellier protocol with correction of TRM anisotropy. The averageintensities overestimate the expected field intensity by 5% (SK) and 6% (BK). This resultemphasizes the necessity of the cooling rate correction. In order to have a detailed evaluation ofthe cooling rate effect, we used several slow cooling rates: 0.8, 0.4, 0.2 and 0.1{\\textdegree}C/min. Thecorrection factors obtained with the 0.8{\\textdegree}C/min cooling ranged between -2% and 21% and wereproportional to the TRM fraction carried by Ti-poor titanohematite. The higher proportion ofthese grains in bricks from SK kiln led to an overestimate of the correction factor and anunderestimate of the intensity by 7%. However, the expected intensity is recovered whentemperature steps higher than 580{\\textdegree}C (i.e. in the range of Ti-poor titanohematites unblockingtemperatures) were excluded from the calculation of archaeointensity and cooling rate correction.In the case of the BK kiln bricks, for which Ti-poor titanohematites does not contributesignificantly to the TRM, all tested cooling rates give average intensities close to the expectedvalue. Incorrectly estimating the duration of the archaeological cooling has therefore a lowimpact on the accuracy of the archaeointensity data on these kinds of material.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\nThe Needle is a fictional character, a mutant supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Mark Gruenwald, Carmine Infantino, and Al Gordon, the character first appeared in Spider-Woman #9 (December 1978). Creator Mark Gruenwald brought the character back during his run on the West Coast Avengers as a member of the villain team Night Shift, which included other former Spider-Woman foes.\nAfter being mugged one night while leaving work, Josef Saint, an elderly tailor, lost an eye and his ability to speak. While recuperating, he discovered that he has the power to paralyze with his gaze. Seeking revenge, Saint assumed the guise of the vigilante the Needle. Armed with a yard-long needle, the mute villain attacked young men on the streets at night, sewing their mouths shut. After victimizing S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jerry Hunt, the Needle incurred the wrath of Spider-Woman, the agent's girlfriend, and she took him out with a close-range venom blast. He was subsequently arrested.\nWith other superhuman adventurers and criminals, the Needle was imprisoned by the Locksmith, but then freed by Spider-Woman.\nThe Needle joined the Night Shift, and teamed with Captain America against the Power Broker and his augmented mutates. Alongside the Night Shift, he tested Moon Knight to take over as the leader of the Night Shift. Later, alongside the Night Shift, he battled the West Coast Avengers. Alongside the Night Shift, the second Hangman, and Satannish, he battled the Avengers West Coast; his abilities had been enhanced by Satannish's black magic.\nThe Needle was later defeated by Armory.\nNeedle appears with the Night Shift, as part of the Hood's gang. They battle the Midnight Sons, and Needle impales Daimon Hellstrom with his needle, before Jennifer Kale knocks him off with a spell. He and the Night Shift are killed when the zombie virus mutates and becomes airborne. The virus cloud begins to rain blood, and reanimates the Night Shift as zombies. Dormammu assumes control of the Night Shift and uses them to fight the Midnight Sons. When Jennifer Kale and the Black Talon contain the virus within the Zombie (Simon Garth), the Night Shift members are apparently restored to normal, and the Hood teleports away with them.\n\nSummary:\nThe Needle is a mutant supervillain created by Mark Gruenwald, Carmine Infantino, and Al Gordon. He first appeared in Spider-Woman #9 in December 1978. Josef Saint, an elderly tailor, lost an eye and his ability to speak after being mugged. He gained the power to paralyze with his gaze while recuperating and became the vigilante the Needle, seeking revenge by sewing the mouths of young men shut. He was eventually arrested and later joined the villain team Night Shift, battling various superheroes and teams, including the West Coast Avengers and the Midnight Sons.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nColdBoreShooter: Finally found the urge to train again after a week-long hiatus.\nNormally I'm training 6 days a week. Last week, I think the election coverage just sapped any motivation I had left. It's been a really rough time lately. I've been unemployed for over a month and getting lots of interviews but no offers yet. Things with the girlfriend have been bad and it's really hurt my outlook. Money is tight and up until Saturday my roommate and I had been unsuccessfully looking for a new tenant. Well now the election is decided, we have a new roommate, I had two promising interviews today and several scheduled for this week, and my girlfriend and I are gonna try to heal things tonight. So I forced myself to go outside and do some shit, although I admit it wasn't fucking easy to take that first\n\nText continuation:\nstep.\nI walked out the door, feeling the crisp autumn air hit my face, and immediately regretted not wearing a jacket. The sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the neighborhood, but I barely noticed. My mind was elsewhere, replaying all the negative thoughts and worries that had been plaguing me for weeks. I had to shake them off, though. I had to focus on the present moment and what I could control.\nAs I started my warm-up, my legs felt like lead and my lungs burned from lack of use. It was like my body was screaming at me to stop, to give up and go back to the comfort of my couch. But I pushed through the discomfort, gradually increasing my pace and intensity. The sweat started dripping down my face, and my muscles began to ache, but I kept going.\nThe first few reps of my workout were a struggle, but as I got into a rhythm, I started to feel a sense of accomplishment. I was doing it. I was taking control of my life, one rep at a time. The stress and anxiety that had been weighing me down started to lift, replaced by a sense of empowerment.\nAs I finished my workout and walked back into my apartment, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had faced my demons and come out on top. I knew that tomorrow would bring new challenges, but I was ready. I was ready to tackle whatever life threw my way, one rep at a time.\nAnd as I sat down to write this, I realized that maybe, just maybe, this little workout was more than just a physical exercise. Maybe it was a metaphor for life. Maybe it was a reminder that no matter how tough things get, we always have the power to take control, to push through the pain and come out stronger on the other side.\nI know that I still have a long way to go. I still have to face the uncertainty of my job search and the challenges of my relationship. But for now, I'm taking things one rep at a time. I'm taking control of my life, one workout at a time. And who knows, maybe someday I'll look back on this tough time and realize that it was the catalyst for something greater. Maybe someday I'll look back and say, \"You know what? That was the best thing that ever happened to me.\"\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

How do i learn about wells, what are the propper terms for this?\nclothespin: Have you been on this forum - http://countryplans.com/smf/index.php ? They have a lot of info. There are also a ton of progress pics, very inspiring!\nphylet: Amazing! found [so many plans](http://bioengr.ag.utk.edu/extension/extpubs/PlanList97.htm)\nclothespin: Oh yeah, that place is like a bible of build-your-own house! \nAre you going to build totally by yourself or will you have family helping you occasionally? Working alone by John Carroll is a pretty good book, lots of tips if you are going to get the job done primarily by yourself. \nAlso, this is one of my favorite projects - http://countryplans.com/smf/index.php?topic=9527.0. The guy did an amazing job, I am in love with the kitchen. \nAll in all, good luck! If you create a subreddit, I will gladly follow it - there not too many people who realize what a great deal it is to build your own house. \nphylet: Ill do most of it by myself, i might hire day labour ocasionally or have friends help for as many hours as they care to; Basically it will be mostly me, but i dont have to worry about things that are impossible solo.\nthews: I have had to use help several times.  I have done the majority of things myself, but some things are best left to people who are very skilled at those things.   I had to have people help with concrete forming and pouring, and drywall finishing.   \nI did a lot of drywall myself, but it isn't very pleasant, and I don't really have the knack for it.  \nphylet: I would 100% be ok with having someone work the concrete. I expect to buy ready-mix, which comes with the truck and crew anyway so i see no other way of doing it, plus, my buddy is high in a local concrete firm, so he will look after me.\nthews: One of my friends owns a shipping company and has dump trucks and connections with concrete companies.   He returns some of my favors with letting his employees help me out some.  I didn't have to do any of the rebar work or pay for the concrete getting poured or the crew to do the finishing.  I did help out some on the digging of the footings.   A guy brought over a tractor, and I had watered the area down for a day so it wasn't  huge struggle to dig out the footers.  The tractor just helped do some grading and move sand around for the middle of the foundation.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Good", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

One thing that really stuck out to me is that most restrooms here don't have paper towels or an electric hand dryer.  I didn't really know what to think, and I spent the first few weeks drying my hands on my hair, (killing two birds with one stone by conveniently styling it at the same time, haha) or on my pants.  Then I happened to be in the bathroom at the same time as one of my coworkers and I had to wait while he washed his hands before me.  Lo and behold, he pulls a handkerchief out of his pocket and dries his hands before leaving...  I was speechless!  Such a simple solution that solves many problems and is\n\nText continuation:\nenvironmentally friendly as well.  Think about how many rolls of paper towel are used in every US bathroom every year...  Long story short - carry a handkerchief to dry your hands instead of using paper towels.  Other benefits include:  wiping your brow while performing stressful tasks, use as a pocket square in a pinch (if it looks nice and isn't too dirty), or blowing your nose when absolutely necessary.\nClintHammer: How is that environmentally friendly?  Paper is a farmed product.  The trees they grow for paper are grown for paper.  If you reduce demand for paper, you reduce the number of trees.\nThe only reason people say paper is bad for the environment is because to make the nice white paper that people like to print things on, the pulp has to be thoroughly treated with chemicals.  Brown men's room towels don't.  \nAlso your \"lifehack\" is carry a handkercheif?  That's not what a lifehack is, you dope.  That's a \"thing I like to do\" \nsupersasuke: I get your point about paper being a farmed product and that cutting down on using tons of it in bathrooms might not technically be any better for the environment, however, I was merely pointing out a very simple (maybe obvious) use of a handkerchief that anyone can choose to start implementing.  I also want to point out that cutting down on the amount of paper towels used will reduce the amount of plastic trash bags used in bathrooms as well, because without the trash constantly filling up, there is less of a need to empty it regularly.  My observation was simply that I never see people in the US carrying or using handkerchiefs, and it seems to be a staple EDC item in India.  I'm sorry if I offended your definition of a \"lifehack\", I just wanted to point out a difference in culture that I noticed that may appeal to certain people who don't find satisfaction in wiping their hands on paper towels every time they visit a restroom...\nClintHammer: &gt; I was merely pointing out a very simple (maybe obvious) use of a handkerchief\n\nYeah, you suggested someone use something for its intended purpose. \nhttp://i.imgur.com/OFi6aaV.png \nsupersasuke: You got me.  I guess I thought it might be worth it because I don't see many people using them at all...  It's interesting how much of a different perspective I'm gaining just being in India for the last few weeks.  Maybe I'll find something a little better to post about, haha\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the  North American Leaders summit in Canada. On Wednesday in Kansas City, Missouri, Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that \"then, as now, people argued that the real problem was America's presence and that if we would just withdraw, the killing would end,\" according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House. \"Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left,\" Bush will say. \"Whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' \" the president will say. The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility, citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam, according to the excerpts. \"Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently,\" Bush will say. On Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, \"President Bush's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two. Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history. \"While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government. It is time to change direction in Iraq, and Congress will again work to do so in the fall.\" The White House is billing the speech, along with another address next week to the American Legion, as an effort to \"provide broader context\" for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad. President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop \"surge\" in Iraq until the report comes out in September.  Watch Bush criticize the Iraqi government \u00bb . It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill, particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin. Bush's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq, as public support for the war continues to sag. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war, and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress, it won't change their opinion. The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq. In addition to his analogy to Vietnam, Bush in Wednesday's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia, including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s, according to the excerpts. \"In the aftermath of Japan's surrender, many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy. Then, as now, the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom,\" Bush will say. \"Today, in defiance of the critics, Japan ... stands as one of the world's great free societies.\" Speaking about the Korean War, Bush will note that at the time \"critics argued that the war was futile, that we never should have sent our troops in, or that America's intervention was divisive here at home.\" \"While it is true that the Korean War had its share of challenges, America never broke its word,\" Bush will say. \"Without America's intervention during the war, and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war, millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nSummary:\nPresident Bush will compare Iraq war to Vietnam, arguing against US withdrawal.\nBush will cite historical lessons, including the price of America's withdrawal in Vietnam.\nHe will also invoke comparisons to US defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II.\nBush will argue that US credibility was compromised by withdrawing from Vietnam.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Bush", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

So I think it's unfair to comment on that,\" he says.\n\"But he's done a great job, got some talented players there at the moment and I think the focus with Wales at the moment will be just winning those next four games and getting to the World Cup.\"\nOK, then, leaving Coleman out of the equation for now, theoretically, would Giggs at least want to manage Wales one day?\n\"I've seen Mark Hughes do it, Cookie [Coleman] do it, Gary Speed do it. It is a good job,\" he adds, still not giving an inch.\n\"And I think, when you are a coach, in my experience United would be a great job and coaching your country. Whether it be soon or in 10 or 15 years' time, we'll just have to wait and see.\"\nAt this point, Giggs bursts into laughter, admitting with a mischievous grin: \"I've not given you an answer there, have I?\"\nYou can understand why Giggs is reluctant to state outright his ambition of managing Wales.\nHe considers Coleman a friend and would not like to be seen to be eyeing his job.\nBesides, if Wales' players and other coaches had their way, Coleman would change his mind and lead them beyond this campaign.\n\"That's totally up to Cookie. What he's done for Welsh football is remarkable,\" says Giggs.\n\"The whole team just captured the imagination at the (2016) Euros and a large part of that is down to him. The team he's built, the character he is, the team spirit.\n\"Teams are very much a shadow of the manager and I think this Welsh team is, knowing Chris as well I do, because he is larger than life, he is a great character, a great person to be around, but also a serious football man.\"\nAs someone who has spent more than half of his life as a professional player or coach, Giggs is also very much a \"serious football man\".\nBut the success and all-consuming nature of his playing career means he is happy to spend some time away from the sport's firing line.\nAnd although a year out may mean a clean break from your profession for most, football has still featured prominently in Giggs' sabbatical-of-sorts.\n\"Life's good. I've just completed my first year without football and it's been good,\" he says.\n\"I've been really busy doing some TV work for the Euros when I finished, then I went to India playing futsal, then a bit more punditry, doing some work for Uefa as a technical observer, which is good keeping me in football, and then just doing the normal dad stuff, watching your son play football, and watching Salford City, who I'm co-owner of. So it's been really busy and really good.\n\"You find out there's a whole big old world out there outside football, so I'm enjoying it.\n\"I think the pressure you put yourself under, be it as a player or a coach, that pressure's sort of come off. It's a strange feeling but it's good.\n\"I'm exactly where I was last summer, more or less got the next six months planned but, with the chance if a club does come in and want to talk, then I can do that.\"\nWhile being football-centric, what the last 12 months have given Giggs is some time away from the pressure cooker of the Premier League and its myriad, relentless demands.\nThat breathing space has allowed the Welshman to contemplate his options, speak to former managers - Sir Alex Ferguson most regularly - and also learn from coaches of other sports.\n\"Rugby is a big love for me because my dad [Danny Wilson] played rugby and I'm a rugby fan, whether it be league or union,\" Giggs says.\n\"I know Rob Howley [former Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half and current assistant coach], I've met Warren Gatland [Wales and Lions head coach], I've spent an evening next to Eddie Jones [England head coach], who was constantly asking me about football - it was brilliant.\n\"I was asking him all about his coaching career, but he was asking me more about football and Sir Alex.\"\nGiggs appears to be refreshed by his time off, chatting excitedly about the previous 12 months and his future managerial career.\nSo does a 'gap year' like this revitalise one's passion for football?\n\"I think it does,\" Giggs says.\n\"It's brilliant I can step out because I was two years as a coach, you're constantly putting yourself under pressure, you're always thinking how you can improve the team, so to step away from it and be a bit more relaxed, you can look at things in a different way.\n\"I think I am ready [to return] but, also, I'm enjoying life and busy doing other stuff. If it happens then great, I'm ready because I've prepared myself as best I could with all my badges and the two years under Louis [van Gaal] at United.\n\"Whether that be in the lower leagues or a foreign club, I don't know. I honestly don't know and that's exciting for me because I've enjoyed this last year. But at some stage, I'm sure I will be back in football, coaching or managing.\"\n\nSummary:\nA little over a decade has passed since Ryan Giggs' final game for Wales yet, even at 43 years old, the former Manchester United winger can still be devilishly elusive.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "assistant", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\n[deleted]: Hard Determinism. Discuss.\nschawt: Determinism is true, but... If you don't know the future you don't know what you are going to do, therefore you don't feel obligated to do a certain thing, therefore you aren't being forced to make a certain choice a certain way (as far as you know). Freedom is the ability to do what you chose to do, which is preserved even in a deterministic universe. However, what you eventually choose to do is determined.\nBeing able to choose and being able to choose what you will choose are different. I don't know how else to explain it.\n[deleted]: You're redefining freedom in a way that would make the compatibilists (Stace, Ayer) proud, but most of us wouldn't say that's what it means to be free. Freedom isn't about thinking you have free will, it's about\n\nText continuation:\nactually having free will.\nschawt: Isn't freedom a subjective experience though?  \nI dunno. This has always confused me. What is it to 'actually' have free will? Cause I thought that was it.\nHow would 'actual' free will actually show up? The entire universe goes about reacting mindlessly, but as soon as you get some gray matter into the equation, the laws of physics are suspended? It seems like a big assumption to make based on a personal impression.\n[deleted]: Actually having free will isn't just thinking you have free will. The example I use in my class is this: If I was a jedi master and I used the force on one of my students and made him say \"I really enjoy this class and I have made this decision freely\". He clearly wouldn't actually have free will.\n'Actual' free will enters the equation if you posit something like an immaterial soul *or* if you change the definition of freedom like the compatibilists do. I don't like either of these options, hence I am a determinism.\nschawt: I dunno, there's a difference between being a slave to a jedi's will and being a slave to your own will. You are a slave to your own will, but that, to me, is the same as being free; doing what you want to do. If you're a slave to someone else, then it kinda transitions into actual slavery right?\n\n[deleted]: Well for one person, what's the difference between being a slave to the laws of physics and being a slave to the jedi's will? In both cases, you think that you have free will, but in both cases you're actually entirely under the control of something other than your will.\n[deleted]: In determinism is there really any such thing as a 'will'?\n[deleted]: Depends on what you mean by \"will\" obviously. If you're talking about an immaterial force that \"emerges\" from an agent, then no.\n[deleted]: Well I figured that. I was just wondering what you, as the determinist, meant by will (I'm also a determinist). Maybe you meant sort of a desire?\nnooneelse: I would add a couple of things to \"desire\" before calling it \"will\".  Things along the lines of \"intention to act\", maybe something about the \"mental action of trying\", though that second one is in more sketchy terms.\nBut it seems clear that \"desire\" and \"will\" come apart.  I can desire something without willing to have it at all.  Indeed, I might have to exercise strong \"willpower\" to overcome a desire.  That could be countered with founding that willpower on a separate desire.  Which just leads me to the point that desires can obviously contradict each other, and we still say that we have each of the desires that contradicts the others.  I don't think that kind of dynamic is ever said of the will.\n[deleted]: agreed. I don't know why I just mentioned 'desire'. I feel like a complete tool.

The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Please give me a short bulleted list of what happened in the 2023 Covenant School shooting incident\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\nOn March 27, 2023, a mass shooting occurred at The Covenant School, a private Presbyterian Church in America parochial school in the Green Hills neighborhood of Nashville, Tennessee. Local resident and former student of the school Aiden Hale (formerly Audrey Elizabeth Hale) killed three children and three adults. Hale, 28, was killed by two Metropolitan Nashville Police Department officers responding to the incident.\nHale was initially reported to be a woman and referred to by his birth name by police. Later, it was confirmed that Hale was a trans man who went by the name Aiden and used he/him pronouns.\nHale drove a Honda Fit to the school, arriving at 9:54 a.m. CDT and parking it in the lot. At 9:57, Hale sent an Instagram message to an old friend saying an earlier post he made was \"basically a suicide note\" and that he planned to die that day. His friend called a crisis hotline before contacting the Davidson County Sheriff's Office at 10:13.\nAt 10:11, Hale shot through a set of glass side doors and entered the building. He was armed with two rifles and a pistol. At 10:13, police received a call about an active shooter. He walked across the second floor of the school before opening fire. He fired into several classrooms; no one in the classrooms was injured because the teachers had fortified doors and sheltered the students. The police first arrived at the school at 10:24. A teacher told an officer that the students were in lockdown and two were missing.\nOfficers entered the building at 10:25 and they searched each room for Hale. They heard gunshots coming from the second floor. Five Metro Nashville police officers went upstairs and saw him in a lobby area, firing through a window at arriving police vehicles.

They were believed to have been focusing their attention on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign chair Paul Manafort, among others.\nAs it turns out, the first bit of concrete public evidence that someone in the president's inner circle might be open to Russian assistance in the presidential election involved Mr Trump's eldest son.\nThe president, Trump Jr and his administration have quickly reformed their defences and are now dismissing the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June as a minor event during a hurly-burly political season, largely lost in the fog of time, that led to nothing and which they have been admirably \"transparent\" in discussing.\nKey members of Congress seem to think otherwise, with senators like Republican Susan Collins of Maine calling for Trump Jr to be questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa eager to bring Manafort before his Senate Judiciary Committee.\nBut while Congress gears up for more hearings, Mr Mueller operates quietly behind the scenes. Where might he look first? What threads, revealed in Trump Jr's emails, will he and his team tug on, to see what unravels?\nHere are a few of the tempting questions he might be tempted to ask.\nNestled toward the end of music publicist Goldstone's explosive first email to Trump Jr about the \"official documents and information\" the Russian government supposedly had about Hillary Clinton was that this constituted just \"part of\" Russia's support for his father, \"helped along by Aras and Emin\" Agalarov, the father-son Moscow-based real estate duo.\nIt's a rather stunning detail for Goldstone to have offhandedly mentioned - and one that Trump Jr, in his \"love it\" response, seems to have breezed past with no comment.\nThat kind of remark, however, would cause anyone looking for evidence of a Trump-Russia campaign collusion to stop dead in their tracks and ask: \"What's the rest of the story?\"\nWhy is this British guy emailing Trump Jr?\nEven if one takes Veselnitskaya at her word that she is not an agent of the Russian government and did not know or provide any damaging information about Mrs Clinton to the Trump team during the 9 June meeting, her own recent admissions raise some pressing questions.\nOn Tuesday she told an NBC interviewer that Trump Jr, Manafort and Kushner may have been \"longing for\" the dirt on their Democratic opponent.\n\"They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted,\" she said.\nIn other words, Veselnitskaya walked out of that meeting in New York with the belief that Mr Trump's campaign both was desperately seeking damaging information about Mrs Clinton and were open to talking to Russian nationals about what they might have to offer.\nGiven that Veselnitskaya is at the very least a well-connected figure in Moscow, it doesn't require a great leap of faith to think this information eventually made its way to the Russian government. If the US intelligence community is to be believed, that government soon would acquire a trove of damaging information about Mrs Clinton and the Democrats as a result of hacks it co-ordinated into the Democratic National Committee server and the personal email of a senior member of Mrs Clinton's campaign team.\nIn the ensuing months, details from those hacks would be made public via Wikileaks at times that were particularly damaging to Mrs Clinton.\nDerogatory statements about Mrs Clinton's Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders were produced the week before Democrats gathered for their national convention. Transcripts of Mrs Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs were published just days before the final presidential debate - and cited during that showdown by Mr Trump himself.\nThe Trump campaign wanted dirt on Mrs Clinton. The Russian government had it in spades. Mr Mueller might want to see if those dots can be connected.\nAnother choice tidbit in that first Goldstone email was his suggestion that he might \"send this info to your father via Rhona\" - a reference to Rhona Graff, the elder Trump's personal assistant.\nGraff has served as the gatekeeper to Mr Trump at the Trump organisation - and, according to a profile in Politico, still is the preferred method for the president's business associates to contact him outside of White House channels.\n\"If I really wanted to whisper something in his ear, I would probably go to Rhona,\" Trump business associate John Catsimatidis told the publication.\nThe White House has said that Mr Trump did not know about the meeting with Veselnitskaya - despite the fact that his son, son-in-law and campaign chief were in attendance and it took place in his New York tower.\nIf this assertion is proven to be inaccurate, Rhona could be the key.\nTrump Jr meeting scandal: The key players\nThe middle portion of the email chain released on Tuesday morning involved Trump Jr and Goldstone trying to set up a phone conversation with Russian pop star/businessman Emin Agalarov.\nAfter a fair bit of wrangling the two apparently spoke, and the very next email was Goldstone informing Trump Jr he was scheduling the meeting with the \"Russian government attorney\" (Veselnitskaya) for later in the week.\nMr Mueller and congressional investigators may be interested in learning what Agalarov said that convinced Mr Trump to move ahead with the plans for a face-to-face gathering.\nAnd what was the nature of the relationship between Agalarov and the Trump clan, in light of Goldstone's observation that Emin and his father were helping Russia's support of the Trump campaign?\nDid Donald Trump Jr break the law?\nFour days after the first email from Goldstone to Trump Jr about the incriminating information the Russia government was said to have about Mrs Clinton, candidate Trump promised to give a \"major speech\" the following week discussing \"all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons\", including Mrs Clinton's alleged misdeeds while serving as secretary of state.\n\"I think you're going to find it very informative and very, very interesting,\" he added.\nThat speech, originally announced for the Monday after the Trump camp's New York meeting with Veselnitskaya, never took place.\nWas this an indication that the elder Trump may have known about the meeting - which, according to Trump Jr, did not produce the promised dirt on Mrs Clinton?\nThat's one more question Mr Mueller might be mulling.\nFollow Anthony Zurcher on Twitter.\n\nSummary:\nThe FBI is investigating the Trump campaign's potential ties to Russia, focusing on Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer and emails suggesting the campaign sought damaging information on Hillary Clinton.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "That", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nFrothySolutions: How can I [46M] be popular when I don't have a community/social environment like a school to be popular in?\nI don't necessarily need everyone to like me, I don't think that's the same as being \"popular.\" I consider it more that... people know about you because they've heard about you. \nWait, I think that's fame. But you wouldn't call a popular kid at school \"famous\" would you?\nGod0fMadness: Kinda as the other commenter is saying but in a different scope.\nThe trick is FIND your own community. If it\u2019s work, a hobby, or a local hang out. Find a place or something you like to do and make it a common everyday place. Over time that\u2019s how you become popular, as well as being good or like able!\nFrothySolutions: But I'm looking for a community, not a club. Work would be a community\n\nText continuation:\n, but I'm not sure if that's the right fit. Maybe I can find a community online, like a forum or a social media group dedicated to a specific topic or interest. But how do I go about finding it? And once I find it, how do I make sure I'm a valued member of that community?\nI think the key is to be genuine and authentic. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. People can usually tell when you're being insincere, and it's a major turnoff. Instead, be yourself and share your unique perspective and experiences. This will help you stand out and make meaningful connections with others.\nAnother important thing is to be active and engaged. Don't just lurk in the shadows, waiting for others to initiate conversations. Take the initiative and start discussions, ask questions, and share your thoughts and opinions. This will show that you're interested and invested in the community, and it will also help you build relationships with others.\nIt's also important to be respectful and open-minded. Listen to others and try to understand their perspectives, even if you don't agree with them. Avoid being confrontational or argumentative, and try to find common ground with others. This will help you build trust and rapport with others, and it will also help you avoid conflicts and drama.\nFinally, be patient and persistent. Building a community and becoming a valued member of it takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results. Keep showing up, being yourself, and engaging with others, and eventually, you'll start to see the fruits of your labor.\nI think the most important thing is to focus on building meaningful relationships with others, rather than trying to be popular or well-known. When you focus on building genuine connections with others, you'll find that popularity and recognition will follow naturally. And even if they don't, you'll still have the satisfaction of knowing that you've made a positive impact on others and that you've built a community that values and appreciates you for who you are.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

two weeks ago but he was delayed by adverse weather.\nMr Robertson, who decided to undertake the challenge after surviving brain surgery, is raising money for charity.\nIf all goes to plan, he will spend Christmas on the South Pole.\nUnassisted and unsupported, he will receive no outside help such as a re-supply by air, and no support from animals or vehicles.\nIn an interview last month with the BBC, Mr Robertson - who also has a pacemaker fitted - said his final preparations for the South Pole attempt included eating \"three hot dogs a day\" so he would put on some weight.\nIt is estimated he will consume 6,500 calories each day, but burn off about 10,000.\nThe 30-year-old, who is from just outside Stonehaven, will drag 110kg (17 stone) of his equipment across 730 miles of snow and ice for about 35 days, experiencing temperatures of -50C and winds of 100mph.\nEvery day, he will consume packets of freeze-dried food - ranging from Thai chicken to spaghetti carbonara - which he will cook on a stove.\nMr Robertson has already managed to raise over \u00c2\u00a334,000 for Marie Curie, exceeding an initial target of \u00c2\u00a325,000 which he had hoped to achieve by the end of the journey to the South Pole.\nAfter arriving on Antarctica two weeks ago, Mr Robertson was delayed as adverse weather delayed his final departure to the starting point of Hercules Inlet.\nA break in the weather allowed the finance worker to finally make the journey on Saturday.\nReaders can follow his progress on social media, and also track his movements on his website.\n\nSummary:\nLuke Robertson, a 30-year-old finance worker, is attempting to reach the South Pole unassisted and unsupported, consuming 6,500 calories daily, to raise over \u00a334,000 for Marie Curie.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nscottd3363: How do you Achieve Happiness?\nI feel as though in the fourteen years of my life I\u2019ve lived I haven\u2019t really experienced true happiness. Of course I still have memorable experiences with friends and family, I live a privileged life, I go to a good school, I have many close friends, and get good grades. As a whole, I feel like as I grow up in a world where social media controls every being around me and everyone posts everything and anything they do and attempt to portray their life as something much better than it is, it becomes exponentially harder to appreciate my life and experience this foreign term \u201chappiness.\u201d Every person I know as a middle schooler constantly posts on their stories or on their other accounts the highlights of their life, they post selfies with filters that\n\nText continuation:\nmake them look flawless, and they share their accomplishments as if they\u2019re the only ones who have achieved something worthwhile. It's as if they're trying to prove to everyone that their life is better than anyone else's.\nBut the truth is, no one's life is perfect. Everyone has their own struggles and insecurities, and social media only serves to mask those imperfections. I've seen people post about their \"perfect\" relationships, their \"amazing\" grades, and their \"incredible\" vacations, but what about the times they're struggling to get out of bed, or the times they're feeling lonely and isolated? What about the times they're dealing with anxiety and depression, or the times they're struggling to make ends meet? Those aren't the things they post about, of course. They only post about the good times, the times that make them look good, the times that make them feel like they're living the \"perfect\" life.\nAnd that's what makes it so hard for me to achieve happiness. I feel like I'm constantly comparing my life to the highlight reels of others, and I always come up short. I feel like I'm not good enough, smart enough, or successful enough. I feel like I'm just a small, insignificant speck in the grand scheme of things, and that no one really cares about me or my life.\nBut the truth is, everyone's life is unique, and everyone's struggles are valid. Everyone has their own \"perfect\" moments, and everyone has their own \"imperfect\" moments. And that's what makes life so beautiful. It's the imperfections, the struggles, and the impermanence that make life worth living. It's the imperfections that make us human.\nSo, how do I achieve happiness? I don't know. But I do know that I need to stop comparing my life to the highlight reels of others, and start embracing my own imperfections. I need to stop trying to be perfect, and start being okay with being me. I need to start focusing on the good things in my life, and stop worrying about what others think of me. I need to start being kind to myself, and stop beating myself up over my mistakes.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, that's the key to true happiness. Maybe it's not about achieving some sort of mythical \"perfect\" life, but about embracing the imperfections and impermanence of life. Maybe it's about being okay with being human, and finding joy in the little things. Maybe it's about being grateful for what I have, and not comparing myself to others. Maybe it's about being kind to myself, and loving myself for who I am, imperfections and all.\nI don't know if I'll ever achieve true happiness, but I do know that I'll keep trying. I'll keep embracing my imperfections, and I'll keep being kind to myself. And maybe, just maybe, that's all it takes to find happiness.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nSNS is a MATLAB-based software library written to aid in the design and analysis of receiver architectures. It uses electrical scattering matrices and noise wave vectors to describe receiver architectures of arbitrary topology and complexity. It differs from existing freely-available software mainly in that the scattering matrices used to describe the receiver and its components are analytic rather than numeric. This allows different types of modeling and analysis of receivers to be performed. Non-ideal behavior of receiver components can be parameterized in their scattering matrices. SNS enables the instrument designer to then derive analytic expressions for the signal and noise at the receiver outputs in terms of parameterized component imperfections, and predict their contribution to receiver\n\nText continuation:\nsystematic errors precisely. This can drive the receiver design process by, for instance, allowing the instrument designer to identify which component imperfections contribute most to receiver systematic errors, and hence place firm specifications on individual components. Using SNS to perform this analysis is preferable to traditional Jones matrix-based analysis as it includes internal reflections and is able to model noise: two effects which Jones matrix analysis is unable to describe. SNS can be used to model any receiver in which the components can be described by scattering matrices. Of particular interest to the sub-mm and terahertz frequency regime is the choice between coherent and direct detection technologies. Steady improvements in mm and sub-mm Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) mean that coherent receivers with LNAs as their first active element are becoming increasingly competitive, in terms of sensitivity, with bolometer-based receivers at frequencies above ~100 GHz. As an example of the utility of SNS, we use it to compare two polarimeter architectures commonly used to perform measurements of the polarized Cosmic Microwave Background: differencing polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in polarization sensitive bolometer-based polarimeters; and pseudo-correlation polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in coherent, LNA-based, polarimeters. We parameterize common sources of receiver systematic errors in both architectures and compare them through their Mueller matrices, which encode how well the instruments measure the Stokes parameters of the incident radiation. These analytic Mueller matrices are used to demonstrate the different sources of systematic errors in differencing and correlation polarimeters.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Ex: /u/&lt;username&gt;.\n/u/vaughannt asked: \n&gt;I'm trying to work up to the arch hold. Currently just doing the leg lift portion for 30 seconds. Should I be feeling muscle activation in my core? It seems like I only feel it in my legs. I was feeling it in my lower back momentarily but I think I've corrected that. Anyone have tips?\nstickysweetastytreat: u/vaughannt\nYeah feeling it in your legs is fine, like along your butt &amp; backs of your thighs. For low back, there are two ways you can do it-- by moving your low back with it, or not. If you want to keep it out of your low back, then tuck your tailbone while you lift your legs solely with your butt + legs.

Michael Essien has made a big impression on new Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. The midfielder, who is in China for the start of the club's pre-season tour, is now tied to the London outfit until the summer of 2013. The 25-year-old has made 143 appearances since moving to Stamford Bridge from French club Lyon in a $49 million transfer in August 2005, scoring 14 goals in total and helping Chelsea win the league title that season. Essien's decision to commit his long-term future to the club is a boost for new manager Luiz Felipe Scolari, who allowed veteran holding midfielder Claude Makelele to join Paris St Germain on Monday. \"I have not been here long but it is clear to me that Michael Essien is one of the best midfield players in the world,\" Scolari said. \"I have always admired him and it is good news for me and for Chelsea that he signs for so long.\" The Accra-born Essien, who started his career in France with Bastia in 2000 before moving to Lyon three years later, was also pleased with the deal. \"I am really pleased to have extended my career with Chelsea,\" he said. \"I am very happy here. We have a great team and fantastic fans who have always made me welcome. \"With the addition of the new manager, I am feeling very positive about the season ahead.\" Chelsea announced on Monday that Czech Republic goalkeeper Cech signed a new five-year deal, while England full-back Wayne Bridge committed himself to four more years last week. Scolari is still seeking to keep England midfielder Frank Lampard, who has ended talks over a new deal and now appears to be resigned to waiting until his contract runs out before joining Inter Milan following the upcoming season. The Brazilian has so far added only Portugal playmaker Deco to his midfield ranks. His first match in charge will be Wednesday's friendly against Guangzhou Pharmaceutical, one of the three games the team will play in China. Striker Didier Drogba, who has been linked with moves to AC Milan and Barcelona, is not among the touring squad due to a recurring knee problem. Khalid Boulahrouz, meanwhile, completed his transfer from Chelsea to Stuttgart on a four-year contract with the Bundesliga club. The Netherlands central defender was released Monday by Chelsea and arrived in Stuttgart's training camp in Austria shortly before midnight after passing a medical exam in Stuttgart. The deal between Stuttgart and Chelsea was completed Tuesday. Details were not given. The Dutchman played for Hamburger SV for two seasons before going to Chelsea in 2006. He was loaned to FC Sevilla last season. Boulahrouz's departure came a day after 35-year-old former France international Claude Makelele signed a two-year deal with Paris-Saint Germain after joining from Chelsea on a free transfer.\n\nSummary:\nGhana international Michael Essien signs new five-year contract with Chelsea\nMidfielder follows Petr Cech and Wayne Bridge in agreeing long-term deals\nThe 25-year-old has made 143 appearances since joining from Lyon in 2005\nDutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz leaves Chelsea for Stuttgart on 4-year deal\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "The", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

A subreddit dedicated to building regular houses would be a fantastic resource. I'd recommend checking out r/HomeImprovement, r/DIY, and r/Architecture, as they cover a wide range of topics related to building and designing homes.\nAs for your concept, it sounds like you're planning to build a foundation slab, which is a common and effective way to create a solid base for your house. When it comes to preparing the ground for the slab, you'll want to make sure it's level, compact, and free of any debris or obstructions.\nTo do this, you can start by excavating the area to the desired depth, then compacting the soil using a plate compactor or a hand tamper. You may also need to add a layer of compacted aggregate material, such as crushed stone or gravel, to provide a stable base for the slab.\nOnce you've prepared the ground, you can pour the slab and let it set. After that, you can start building your walls using concrete blocks, which is a great choice for a DIY project. When it comes to cavity fill, you'll want to choose a material that provides good insulation and can withstand the elements.\nSome popular options for cavity fill include fiberglass batts, spray foam insulation, and rigid foam board. You can also consider using a combination of these materials to achieve the desired level of insulation and structural integrity.\nAnother thing to consider is the type of concrete blocks you'll be using. You'll want to choose blocks that are designed for exterior use and can withstand the weather conditions in Texas. You may also want to consider using blocks with a built-in insulation value, such as those made with foam inserts or filled with insulation material.\nIn terms of the design of your house, you may want to consider factors such as the orientation of the building, the placement of windows and doors, and the overall aesthetic you're aiming for. You can also look for inspiration online or in architecture books to get a sense of different styles and designs.\nFinally, don't forget to check with local building codes and regulations to ensure that your design meets all the necessary requirements. It's also a good idea to consult with a professional builder or architect to get their input and guidance on your project.\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\nphylet: Ah, great point about the local building codes! It's always important to check with the authorities to ensure that your design meets all the necessary requirements.\nAs for the design of your house, you may want to consider factors such as the orientation of the building, the placement of windows and doors, and the overall aesthetic you're aiming for. You can also look for inspiration online or in architecture books to get a sense of different styles and designs.\nFor example, you could consider a modern design with large windows and a sleek, minimalist aesthetic. Or, you could opt for a more traditional design with a rustic, earthy feel. The possibilities are endless, and it's all about finding the style that resonates with you and your family.\nIn terms of the materials you'll need for your project, you'll want to make sure you have a good supply of concrete blocks, insulation material, and other necessary materials. You may also want to consider using recycled or sustainable materials to reduce your environmental impact.\nAnother thing to consider is the size of your house. Will it be a small, cozy home or a larger, more spacious one? You'll want to make sure you have enough space for your family and any future additions.\nFinally, don't forget to plan for any necessary permits and inspections. You'll want to make sure you have all the necessary approvals before you start building, and that you're in compliance with local building codes.\nI hope this helps!

It's always important to make sure you're in compliance with local building codes and regulations.\nAs for the size of your house, you may want to consider factors such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms you need, the amount of living space you require, and the overall layout of the house. You can also look at different floor plans online or in architecture books to get a sense of different designs and layouts.\nFor example, you could consider a single-story home with a large open-plan living area, or a two-story home with a master bedroom and bathroom on the second floor. The possibilities are endless, and it's all about finding the design that works best for you and your family.\nIn terms of the materials you'll need for your project, you'll want to make sure you have a good supply of concrete blocks, insulation material, and other necessary materials.

Sen. Hillary Clinton's eyes welled with tears as she spoke in New Hampshire Monday. At the close of a Portsmouth campaign stop, Marianne Pernold-Young, 64, asked Clinton: \"How do you do it? How do you keep up ... and who does your hair?\" Clinton said she had help with her hair on \"special days,\" and that she drew criticism on the days she did not. Then she added: \"It's not easy, and I couldn't do it if I just didn't, you know, passionately believe it was the right thing to do. \"You know, I have so many opportunities from this country, I just don't want to see us fall backwards,\" she said, her voice breaking a bit. The audience applauded. \"This is very personal for me, it's not just political, it's [that] I see what's happening, we have to reverse it,\" she said emotionally, adding that some \"just put ourselves out there and do this against some pretty difficult odds. \"But some of us are right and some of us are wrong. Some of us ready and some of us are not. Some of us know what we will do on day one, and some of us really haven't thought that through enough.\" \"So as tired as I am and I am. And as difficult as it is to try and keep up what I try to do on the road, like occasionally exercise and try to eat right -- it's tough when the easiest food is pizza -- I just believe so strongly in who we are as a nation. So I'm going to do everything I can and make my case and you know the voters get to decide.\"  Watch Clinton become emotional as she's answering a question \u00bb . The New York senator is under pressure after some weekend surveys show opponent Barack Obama with a sudden almost double digit lead, with less than a day to go until the New Hampshire primary. At a New Hampshire campaign event, presidential rival John Edwards told reporters he was unaware of Clinton's emotional reaction and would not respond to it. But he did say, \"I think what we need in a commander in chief is strength and resolve, and presidential campaigns are a tough business, but being president of the United States is also a very tough business. \"And the President of the United States is faced with very, very difficult challenges every single day, difficult judgments every single day.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nSummary:\nHillary Clinton became emotional during a New Hampshire campaign event, her eyes welling with tears.\nShe spoke about her passion for her work and her desire to reverse the country's current direction.\nClinton said she couldn't do it without believing it was the right thing to do.\nThe audience applauded, and her emotional response was met with applause.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations. Half of the continuations contain people's names and half don't, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\n[deleted]: The Neverending Fence is 8 years in the making and made using still alive willow saplings\n[deleted]\nClaxonic: Really cool!\nBut then in a few years the fucking Property Brothers buy the house to flip and \u201cupdate\u201d the landscape by tearing it out.\nMattTheProgrammer: Honestly this look isn\u2019t for me. I respect the technique and the effort but I would never want this in front of my house. Maybe if I had a wooded lot as a partition in the back. But that\u2019s a big if.\nPuzzled-Delivery-242: Which is fair. I think they were trying to make the point that alot of the time diy shows do things that remove character from the homes in favor of mass appeal. Which makes sense because of resale value but at the same time it would be nice to see houses that have their own character and dont look like\n\nText continuation:\n... cookie-cutter versions of each other. I mean, who wants to live in a house that could be easily mistaken for someone else's? Where's the personality? The uniqueness? The story behind the walls? It's like the DIY shows are trying to erase the soul of the home, leaving behind a bland, generic shell that could be replicated a thousand times over.\nAnd don't even get me started on the so-called \"experts\" who claim that this is the way to go. They'll tell you that a modern, sleek design is the key to success, that it's all about creating a \"wow factor\" that will make potential buyers swoon. But what about the people who actually live in these homes? What about the families who want to make memories, who want to create a sense of community and belonging? Do they really care about the \"wow factor\"? I think not.\nI've seen it time and time again - a beautiful, unique home, full of character and charm, gets torn down and replaced with some soulless, cookie-cutter monstrosity. And for what? So that some real estate agent can make a quick buck? So that some developer can line their pockets with gold? It's a travesty, plain and simple.\nBut I digress. Back to the Neverending Fence. I have to admit, it's a impressive feat of engineering, even if it's not my personal cup of tea. I mean, who wouldn't want to live in a house with a fence that's been growing for 8 years? It's like having your own personal work of art, right in your backyard. And the fact that it's made from willow saplings is just the cherry on top. It's like a living, breathing, ever-changing piece of art.\nOf course, as Puzzled-Delivery-242 pointed out, it's not just about the fence itself, but about the message it sends. It's a statement about the importance of preserving character, of holding onto what makes us unique and special. It's a reminder that we don't have to conform to some arbitrary standard of beauty or design. We can be different, we can be bold, we can be ourselves.\nAnd who knows? Maybe one day, the Neverending Fence will be seen as a pioneering work of art, a game-changer in the world of DIY design. Maybe it will inspire a new generation of homeowners to think outside the box, to push the boundaries of what's possible, to create something truly unique and special.\nBut until then, I'll just keep on admiring the Neverending Fence, and the message it sends about the importance of preserving character, and the beauty of being different.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Approved", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

It added that the action was designed to save about $375m (\u00c2\u00a3236m) a year.\nThe move follows a period of turmoil at the firm.\nCarol Bartz was dismissed as chief executive in September after failing to turn around the company's fortunes. Chairman Roy Bostock and co-founder Jerry Yang also later resigned from its board.\nIn January, former Paypal executive Scott Thompson was named the organisation's fourth chief executive in five years.\nA recent study by the analytics company Comscore suggested that Yahoo's share of online search queries in the USfell below 14% for the first time in February, putting it further behind Google and Microsoft.\nA statement issued by Mr Thompson's said: \"We are intensifying our efforts on our core businesses and redeploying resources to our most urgent priorities. Our goal is to get back to our core purpose -putting our users and advertisers first - and we are moving aggressively to achieve that goal.\"\nIt added that the firm would now focus on a \"deep\" personalised experience for users and a return on investment for investors.\nThe firm has not given any indication of when the cuts would be made. It said it would provide more information about its \"future direction\" when it released an earnings update on 17 April.\nAs Yahoo shrinks, Skype is growing. Once all the new positions are filled, the business expects to have 1,600 employees worldwide.\nAs part of the expansion it is launching a new technology centre in central London. It says the move would increase its headcount in the city by 40% to 330 posts.\nThe UK government's desire to monitor people using its services did not influence Skype's decision\nIt aims to have completed the first stage of the hiring process by the end of June.\nSkype's vice-president of product and design told the BBC the new jobs would cover software engineering, product management and design.\n\"We have one project about 'big data', which is about making use of data that our users generate when using the product to improve the quality of the products we offer,\" said Rick Osterloh.\n\"We also a number of initiatives we are working on in the web area, and we are hiring some positions for our newly formed Xbox division.\"\nSkype's move signals that it is not overly concerned about the UK government's intention to give the country's security services increased access to internet data.\nDeputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has specifically identified Skype as one of the services that the government wants to be monitored.\nA statement from Skype said that: \"We are not in a position to comment on the UK government's proposed legislation. We do of course comply with legislation in all countries in which we operate.\"\nSkype's use of peer-to-peer technology for its call and instant-messaging services means that it does not store the contents of communications on its servers, and so could not hand the information over unless it changed its systems.\n\nSummary:\nYahoo announces plans to cut 2,000 jobs to save $375 million annually and focus on core businesses, while its subsidiary Skype creates 400 new positions in five cities.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\ndata constitutes a special category of sensitive personal data, it is appropriate to classify as high-risk several critical use cases of biometric systems, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law. Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. This is particularly relevant when it comes to age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. Therefore, remote biometric identification systems should be classified as high-risk in view of the risks that they pose. This excludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she claims\n\nText continuation:\n.\nIn addition, it is crucial to establish clear guidelines and regulations for the development, deployment, and use of biometric systems, to ensure that they are designed and implemented in a way that respects the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. This includes ensuring that biometric systems are transparent, explainable, and accountable, and that individuals have the right to access, correct, and delete their biometric data. Furthermore, it is essential to establish robust mechanisms for monitoring and auditing the use of biometric systems, to detect and prevent potential biases and discriminatory effects.\nMoreover, it is important to recognize that biometric systems can have a significant impact on vulnerable populations, such as children, older adults, and individuals with disabilities. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that biometric systems are designed and implemented in a way that takes into account the specific needs and circumstances of these populations, and that they are not used in a way that perpetuates or exacerbates existing inequalities.\nIn conclusion, the use of biometric systems raises significant ethical and legal concerns, and it is essential to establish clear guidelines and regulations to ensure that they are used in a way that respects the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. By doing so, we can ensure that biometric systems are used to promote social justice and equality, rather than to perpetuate discrimination and inequality.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

In Sierra County, Proctor worked as a lawyer and as the assessor of Sierra County. In 1858, he moved with a group of four members from Downieville to Eagle Valley in the area that is now known as Nevada. When they arrived, three members of the group, Curry, Musser, and Proctor, bought the Eagle Ranch for $1,000 and a down payment of $300. The ranch was situated on the current location of Carson City and thus the group founded Carson City with Proctor as a co-founder. In 1864, he claimed to have named the city, but Abraham Curry is generally given credit for that. Proctor owned one\n\nText continuation:\n-third of the Eagle Ranch, but gave half of it to Benjamin F. Green, who was the fourth member of the group. In 1859, Proctor was vice-president of a constitutional convention, that had as objective to create Nevada Territory. During the convention, Proctor represented Humboldt County. After Nevada became a territory, he filed his candidacy to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the territory, but he lost.\nProctor was a member of the 1864 Nevada Constitutional Convention, that started on July 4 and produced an approved constitution. He was elected member with 118 votes. Proctor was one of the two members representing Nye County and he was the only Democrat at the Convention; all others were Unionists. Records from the Convention stated that Proctor was married. He was elected senator of Nye County in the Nevada Senate on November 8, 1864, and his term began the following day. He served in three regular sessions and one special session. In the first and second regular session, he was the only Democratic member of the Nevada Senate. Proctor advocated states' rights and legislation to extend suffrage to women and to make it possible for women to hold public office. His term ended in 1868 and he was succeeded by Robert Mullen. During the 1860s or 1870s, he moved to another state and he died in 1892. East and West Proctor Street in Carson City were named after Proctor and in 1995 he was inducted by a senate resolution into the Senate Hall of Fame of Nevada.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

He then moved to Tennessee, where he established the town of LaFollette. His company, LaFollette Coal, Iron, and Railway Company, eventually employed more than 1500 people and was the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States.\n\nSummary:\nHarvey Marion LaFollette (September 8, 1858 \u2013 September 20, 1929) was an American teacher and educator, who as a young man, served two terms as Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. He then moved to Tennessee, where he established the town of LaFollette. His company, LaFollette Coal, Iron, and Railway Company, eventually employed more than 1500 people and was the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States.\nEarly life and education\nHarvey M. LaFollette was born in Primrose, Wisconsin. His first cousin, Robert Marion La Follette Sr., was three years old at the time and living on the adjoining farm. Harvey's father (also named Harvey M. LaFollette) was a farmer and served in local government both as sheriff and commissioner. When Harvey was two years old, his family relocated to join relatives in Thorntown, Indiana. Harvey's brother, William La Follette, was born shortly after they arrived in Indiana. When he was seven years old, his father was killed in an industrial accident while working on a piece of machinery in the flour mill he owned.\nYoung Harvey was always an avid reader, and after studying at the nearby Friends School and a short stint at Wabash College, he left for France, the land of his Huguenot ancestors, to continue his education. He studied in Paris at several institutions focusing on languages and civil engineering. He left Paris, travelling on foot and staying with peasant families to better understand the local dialects. He took additional courses in Germany and in Italy. He returned to Indiana in 1880 as a well-educated and travelled young man. He spoke five languages fluently.\nIndiana educator\nHe began teaching in the public schools as soon as he returned from abroad and became a school principal and a county superintendent before running for statewide office at the age of 28. He was elected to two terms as Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. In this job, he established a number of reforms as he standardized the textbooks and regularized the financial systems.\nLaFollette, Tennessee\nAlong with his youngest brother, Grant LaFollette, Harvey then moved some 400 miles (640 km) to the south and purchased more than 37,000 acres (150 km2) of land in the Tennessee mountains. He established and served as president and general manager of a company that eventually employed 1,500 people and became the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States. He built a railroad that allowed his product to be shipped. The town that grew up around his business venture was named LaFollette in his honor and became the county seat of Campbell County.\nPersonal life\nGlen Oaks\nHarvey built and lived in Glen Oaks, a 27\u2013room mansion in the center of LaFollette designed by Knoxville architect George Franklin Barber. The home on Indiana Avenue is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As his company grew, he traveled extensively and remained close to his extended family. During the glare of the Wisconsin governor's race of 1900, his mother and older brother and sister returned to Primrose with cousin Robert and other family members to visit the old log cabin where Harvey was born and to relive memories of the pioneering days of a half century earlier. During the next decade, Harvey and his wife were often in Washington, DC, visiting family members and meeting political allies. Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks was a friend from his younger days in Indiana. His brother and cousin both moved to the nation's capitol as members of Congress, and he visited them often. Later in his life, when the mines no longer produced and his business failed, he returned to his academic roots, corresponding with Abraham Lincoln scholar Louis A. Warren, who wrote The Lincoln and LaFollette Families in Pioneer Drama, a history of the Lincoln and LaFollette families on the Kentucky frontier in the years before Jesse LaFollette and Thomas Lincoln took their families across the Ohio River to settle in Indiana Territory.\nFamily\nHe was a member of the La Follette family. William La Follette was a younger brother. Robert M. La Follette Sr. was his first cousin. William Leroy LaFollette Jr. and Chester La Follette were nephews. Suzanne La Follette was a niece.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nAkashh23_pop: what kind of questions to ask when opening your first bank account?\nI feel like some banks have hidden fees when it comes to using their services. What are minimum balances, are there any interest rates. What are the benefits of using a credit card &amp; debit card? Are there any ways to invest money?  What benefit do you provide stuff like that comes to my mind but I want to save as much money as possible as a college student since I'm working a minimum wage part time job in a fast food place. I don't know much about finance and I'm not really sure where to ask so I'm trying to Google.\ntexaseclectus: Use a credit union. Also ask if it has overdraft protection, and if so have them remove it immediatly. \nUnder no circumstances should you ever have over draft protection.\nBearcarnikki\n\nText continuation:\n: Why?\ntexaseclectus: Everyone at some point, for a variety of reasons, will not have enough money in there account to cover something they're paying for. \nIt's going to happen. A LOT. It's not a big deal.\nSo here's what happens when you run out of money and try to pay for something with no \"protection\"-\nThe sale or transfer is declined and you are immediately notified. There are no penalties and you have an opportunity to investigate/transfer money/ or just decline the sale. Nothing happens and you dont lose anything you dont owe anything.\nEssentially you are promptly made aware of your financial status and are able - FREE OF CHARGES - to make decisions regarding that status.\nThis prevents you from spending what you dont have and costs nothing. Its essential. \nWith overdraft \"protection\"\nYou are NOT notified that there isn't enough money to cover something. The bank instead agrees to the sale on your behalf, gives you a loan to cover it and charges you 30 bucks for the service. You're giving them permission to fine you 30 bucks for not having money to cover something, WHY? \nNot having enough money sucks but for the love of God do not ask a bank to take 30 bucks from you every time it happens.\nEdit adding example for context:\nImagine you wake up payday, and it's a federal holiday you weren't aware of. You haven't been paid but you *think* you have so you go about your day. \nIf you have overdraft protection every purchase you make that day will have a 30$ fee tied to it. Get gas, buy coffee, buy lunch and BOOM you owe 90 bucks because you didnt know it was veterans day.\nWithout protection you'll be notified you dont have $ instantly and learn your bank doesn't process checks on veterans day so nothing happens.\nJJ_burrito: My bank just charges interest on the overdraft balance, can\u2019t believe yours charges $30 per transaction.\nMaybe look for another bank?\ntexaseclectus: I can't believe youre ok with paying interest for no reason. \nI could literally just tell your bank \"no overdraft protection\" and I'm being charged less than you. Maybe tell your bank \"no overdraft protection\"?\nJJ_burrito: I\u2019m paying interest on a loan. It comes out to cents per day which is much preferred to $30 per transaction.\nSometimes I need the overdraft\ntexaseclectus: \"Cents per day\" amounts to the same thing as that 30 bucks when you compare the alternative of 0.\nBoth sums are this equation:\n I'm not paying any money and you're paying *some* money.\nMicro loans are never necessary and you never need overdraft.\nJJ_burrito: Not true.

If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says journalists don't serve the public if they push rumors. (CNN) -- Two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the Internet. One week before comedian Bernie Mac passed away, text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died. I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead. The rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times. What makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition. Then there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards. The story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging. Ultimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened. There has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\" Sorry, Rick, I disagree. The most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control. Running with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion. The rumors kept going and going\u00ad and when the story hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire. In one week, Bear Stearns was no more, and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the Wall Street behemoth. We should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story. The rules are simple: Either you have the facts or you don't. If you do, you run with the story. If you don't, you leave it alone. The National Enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront Edwards as he was leaving the Beverly Hills Hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair. Then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the Enquirer said was the child of the mistress. With other major media outlets turning up the heat, Edwards admitted the affair in an interview with ABC's Bob Woodruff. No media executive should be pulling his or her hair out, trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor. If they had, and the facts didn't support the rumor, then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more. We have an obligation to stick with the facts, and nothing else. And no matter what a blogger, Web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with, the day we choose to alter our standards, our credibility and integrity will be shot. In the end, as former ABC News anchor Max Robinson said in 1988, that's all we've got. Nothing is worth losing that, even getting the scoop on an affair involving a candidate whose political career is likely over. Roland S. Martin is an award-winning journalist and CNN contributor.

an umbrella body for providers of housing support and social care services - analysed responses from 332 homeless people from 21 out of 22 local authority areas.\nIt was commissioned by the Welsh Government to look at the experiences of people who had slept rough, stayed in a hostel or B&B, stayed with friends or relatives, or applied to the council as homeless.\nA third of the sample stated their homelessness was caused, at least in part, by a health problem, when drug or alcohol problems were included as part of a broadly defined health issue.\nNearly a quarter who were admitted to hospital said they were discharged to the streets or \"unsuitable accommodation\".\nMore than two-thirds of respondents had not had a hepatitis B or flu vaccination and half the eligible female respondents did not have cervical smears or breast examinations on a regular basis.\nWaiting times, the inability to make an appointment, as well as drug and alcohol problems are some of the factors which prevent people from accessing health services, the report said.\nCymorth Cymru director Katie Dalton said the results suggested poor health was a cause as well as an effect of homelessness.\n\"People can start to experience a physical or mental health problem and that can impact on their ability to engage in employment - they could see their income reduce or stop, not be able to afford their rent or mortgage and lose their home,\" she said.\n\"We know that around 30% of people who are homeless saw their health get worse in the past 12 months and that many of them face barriers to accessing a range of health services that could have prevented that deterioration from happening.\"\nRecommendations\nMs Dalton added: \"It's really important that we think more creatively to improve those health stats in future\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 this isn't necessarily about more resources - it's about being smarter.\n\"Significant proportions of homeless people use emergency departments and ambulances to access hospital - we believe that if early intervention was working, those people could be prevented from needing those services and reduce pressure on the NHS.\n\"We actually found that 63% of people who filled out the questionnaire didn't have a drug or alcohol problem - that's probably in contrast to what public perception is around substance misuse.\"\nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We continue to work closely with Public Health Wales, health boards, local authorities and homelessness organisations to ensure appropriate services are planned and delivered to meet the health needs of homeless people and those at risk of homelessness.\"\n\nSummary:\nHomeless people are struggling to access healthcare, according to a new Wales-wide report.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

It is now the main attraction at Hartlepool's Maritime Experience and attracts 54,000 visitors a year.\nBryn Hughes, general manager of the HMS Trincomalee Trust said: \"The positive links with the NMRN in Portsmouth will heighten public awareness of HMS Trincomalee.\n\"It is a wonderful long-term scheme following hard on the profile of the recent Tall Ships Races so successfully staged in Hartlepool.\"\nThe rarely seen journals will eventually be included in the static Trincomalee exhibition in Hartlepool.\nOne journal dates from 1852 and was kept by midshipman William Dawson. It contains a detailed log and tracking maps of the journeys that HMS Trincomalee took during that period.\nDr Dominic Tweddle, director general of the NMRN, said: \"The opportunity to welcome HMS Trincomalee as a part of the museum means that the story of the Royal Navy, its ships and its people can now be told on a national scale.\"\nHMS Trincomalee was built for the Admiralty in Bombay and served in the West Indies and the Pacific.\nIt was stationed in West Hartlepool between 1862 and 1877 as a training ship.\n\nSummary:\nThe journals of HMS Trincomalee, written by sailors on board the 1817 vessel, will be incorporated into the National Museum of the Royal Navy, providing a unique glimpse into the ship's history.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations. Half of the continuations contain people's names and half don't, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nThe influence of cooling rate on the intensity of thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) and the necessity to correct archaeo/palaeointensities for this effect have long been recognized. However the reliability of the correction is still questioned. We studied 35 bricks baked in two modern kilns (SK and BK) in known experimental conditions and with measurements of the direction and intensity of the geomagnetic field at the site. The smallest kiln (SK, 0.2 m 3) cooled in around 12 hours and the biggest kiln (BK, 8 m 3) in around 40 hours. Thermomagnetic, hysteresis and backfield curves indicated that the main magnetic carriers were Ti-poor titanomagnetites and Tipoortitanohematites. The fraction of the TRM carried by Ti-poor titanohematites is the maindifference between the two sets of bricks. This\n\nText continuation:\ndifference is likely to be responsible for the observed variations in TRM intensity and direction. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the relationship between cooling rate and TRM intensity, as well as to develop a reliable method for correcting archaeo/palaeointensities for this effect. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering the cooling rate of a sample when interpreting TRM data, and demonstrate the need for careful consideration of the experimental conditions under which the sample was baked.\nIn this study, we have demonstrated the significant impact of cooling rate on the intensity of TRM, and the need for careful consideration of this effect when interpreting TRM data. The results of this study have important implications for the field of archaeomagnetic dating, and highlight the need for further research into the relationship between cooling rate and TRM intensity. The use of modern kilns to simulate the conditions under which ancient ceramics were baked provides a valuable tool for understanding the magnetic properties of these materials, and can help to improve the accuracy of archaeomagnetic dating. By combining this approach with careful consideration of the experimental conditions under which the sample was baked, it is possible to develop a more accurate and reliable method for correcting archaeo/palaeointensities for the effect of cooling rate.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Good", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries. Half of the summaries contain people's names and half don't, but I don't know which is which. The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Provide a one-sentence summary (no more than 30 words) with no other text.\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\nThe lovelorn ballad only reached number 108, but it set the \"dirt poor\" Tennessee singer on the path to fame.\nSince then, she's sold more than 100 million albums, topped the country chart 25 times, and won eight Grammy Awards - but she shows no signs of slowing down.\n\"Almost every day I come up with a few song titles or a sweet melody,\" says the 70-year-old, who claims to have written more than 3,000 songs in her career.\nHer latest album, Pure & Simple, came out on Friday, featuring new songs with stripped-down arrangements that recall the early days of her career.\nIt has an overwhelmingly romantic theme, inspired by renewing her wedding vows earlier this year. And just like her chart career, her marriage to Carl Dean turned 50 this year.\n\"I thought, well, this would be a good year to write an album of love songs,\" she says. \"I've never done that before. I've usually had a story song or a gospel song, but this was all love stories.\"\nThe BBC caught up with the star to discuss the new record, her legendary Glastonbury set, and why she admires Adele.\nFirst of all, congratulations on celebrating your golden wedding anniversary!\nThank you so much. That's a long time to do anything, ain't it? Especially to be married.\nWhat's the secret?\nWe've always been good buddies. We have a lot of fun and a lot of respect for one another. It was his first marriage and mine and we never thought we'd ever want to do that again. Why bother?\nYou renewed your vows earlier this year. What was that like?\nThat was sweet. There was no pressure at all. We had our own little ceremony in a little chapel on our property, then we went in our little RV down to Ringgold, Georgia, and spent the night where we had married 50 years before. We took some beautiful pictures and got all dressed up. It was fun really.\nDid you wear your original wedding dress? Could you still fit into it?\nWell, I could but I don't know where it is now! I only had a simple little white dress that my mother had made for me for that wedding, but I had always wanted a beautiful, long, beaded wedding gown, so I dressed completely to the nines. I made a right nice bride!\nThat sense of romance permeates your new album.\nOh yes! In fact a lot of the songs were written just because of that.\nYou've written so many love songs over the years - how do you find new ways to talk about it?\nLove is always growing, and we grow as people as well, so you just automatically take on new twists and turns. And it's amazing. I've always been amazed by that myself, how people can just write, year in and year out, about love and it all is different. I could write one right now!\nHow often do you write?\nI write something almost every single day unless I'm sick or on a movie set.\nIs that ever an inconvenience? Do you ever find yourself going, \"I don't have time to write a song right now, I need to finish this casserole?\"\nWell, no! In fact, I write a lot when I cook. If my cooking's really good that day, my songs are really good.\nIn Head Over High Heels, you sing about \"painting my eyes like Adele.\" What made you write about her?\nEveryone loves Adele. With all my little nieces, it's all \"Adele this\" and \"Adele that!\" And I love how she does her make-up, and so I'm always saying to my little nieces, \"can you fix my eyes like Adele?\"\nWhen I started that song, I had not planned to write that line. I was just thinking, \"This needs to be about a girl dressing up sexy, so she's got to have some make-up, and she's got to paint her eyes\". And all of a sudden it's like, \"And my eyes like Adele!\"\nWhat do you think her reaction will be?\nI think she'll have to be complimented, just like I'm always complimented when people write songs about me!\nI just meant I wanted to look like Adele. I hope she thinks it's cute.\nYou both like to talk to your audience in between songs, but she swears a lot more than you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I wondered what you made of that?\nOh, I don't pay any attention to that! Words are just an exchange, like money. I don't think the Lord holds that against us. I think that's just the way we communicate. And some people are just born cussers.\nWhat's the worst thing you've ever said on stage?\nOh, I've never said anything real bad. I try to respect the audience.\nThe song I'm 16 is based on one of your sisters, is that right?\nYeah, she had a couple of bad relationships and she thought it wasn't meant for her to have true love. Then all of a sudden, in her 60s, she met someone and they fell in love, and it's just like they were born again. It's just the sweetest thing.\nAnother one of my sisters and I were laughing. We said, \"Look at her, she thinks she's 16!\" and all of a sudden I heard the song in my head.\nGoes to show you're never old unless you choose to be.\nWhat age do you think of yourself as?\nI'm 16 in some ways. I'm still a hopeless romantic! But I'm 35 in my spirit and in my mind. When I was 35, it was a pinnacle, a great time in my life - success and happiness and all that. And so I just decided \"I'm gonna claim that number and always be that in my state of mind.\"\nWhat inspired Can't Be That Wrong?\nThat was an easy one to write. I think it's the ultimate cheating song.\nI based it on someone very, very close to me, who was very much in love with the person at home, and their children, and they weren't looking for love, they just happened to fall for someone. They were so torn, because they loved both people. I saw the turmoil and the heartache, and how overwhelming and overpowering it was. And I just thought, \"That's a strong-ass love, right there\". You know, to be willing to go through all you have to, and put the other people through that. So I thought, \"wow, this would make a great song.\"\nThe last time I saw you on stage in the UK was at Glastonbury - and you've put that concert on this album as a bonus disc. What are your memories of it?\nThat'll be one of my greatest memories, actually. That'll be a real highlight in my career.\nI wasn't even certain about doing that show, because I didn't know if I was the type of artist that would fit in that type of a festival - because people are rowdy, they like to go dancing, and they like to drink and smoke and I thought, \"I wonder if they're even going to pay attention?\"\nAnd so, as soon as I went out and I saw the crowd and heard the roar, I thought, \"Ohhhh, my Lord, how did I miss this all these years?\"\nThey call that part of the day the \"legends slot\".

There has been numerous studies that show a correlation between saturated and trans fat intake with atherosclerosis.  Here is one of the many.\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18175752\n&gt; CONCLUSION: Higher habitual intakes of saturated and trans fats are independently associated with increased subclinical atherosclerosis, and alcohol intake may attenuate the relation between saturated fat and subclinical atherosclerosis.\nI appreciate WSJ opinion piece but *it should not be confused with actual science*.  It is one individual casting doubt on a very large body of evidence, which is admittedly still understudied.  I would put\n\nText continuation:\nthis in the same vein as climate change denial \u2014 a necessary skepticism that has the unfortunate side effect of confusing the populace.\njeff303: So against a meta-analysis of 76 other studies, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, you're putting up a single food-questionnaire study.  That's great, people should consider all evidence.  The point that the article is making is that the **weight** of *all* the evidence does not support the hypothesis that saturated fat consumption is inherently dangerous for one's heart.\nkarmature: Here's a decent wikipedia article that discusses this controversy.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat_and_cardiovascular_disease_controversy\n&gt; Medical, heart-health, and governmental authorities, such as the World Health Organization, the American Dietetic Association, the Dietitians of Canada, the British Dietetic Association, American Heart Association, the British Heart Foundation, the World Heart Federation, the British National Health Service, the United States Food and Drug Administration, and the European Food Safety Authority advise that saturated fat is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).\nThere are a handful of deniers who stand against a massive consensus that there is both a correlation and causal relationship between saturated/trans fat and atherosclerosis.\nliatris: Post your sources. So far you only posted a single food questionnaire. \nkarmature: The [link in the post above](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat_and_cardiovascular_disease_controversy) provides discussion and evidence for both those of the majority, who claim a causal link, and those of the minority, which deny a correlation.

During IODP Expedition 362, total porosity of the sedimentary section entering the North Sumatra subduction zone was measured. This total porosity is derived from the total water content of core samples thus including pore water and water bound to hydrous minerals like smectite. Clay mineral composition varies over the sedimentary section and is mainly kaolinite/illite in the Nicobar Fan units and smectite/illite in the prefan pelagic unit below. The prefan pelagic unit shows anomalously high total porosity values and is stratigraphically\n\nText continuation:\ncorrelated to a high amplitude negative polarity (HANP) seismic reflector located landward. This HANP reflector has been previously interpreted as a porous fluid-rich layer where the d{\\'e}collement may develop along parts of the margin as a consequence of pore pressure buildup. We estimate clay bound water content from Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) which gives information about the smectite/illite composition and soluble chloride content data. Interstitial porosity corresponds to onboard total porosity corrected from clay bound water and is more relevant in terms of sediment compaction state and fluid flow properties. Interstitial porosity versus vertical effective stress curve shows no evidence of undercompaction and suggests that the input section 2 has been experiencing normal consolidation due to high sediment accumulation rate. The porosity anomaly observed in the prefan pelagic unit results from the local occurrence of water-bearing minerals like smectite rather than excess pore pressure, which might, however, buildup more landward in the basin. We also estimate fracture porosity using a resistivity model for shales used in previous works based on wireline resistivity log and show that fracture porosity yields 4-6% in damaged parts of the sedimentary section investigated.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Mehmed, pronounced [icin\u02c8d\u0292i \u02c8mehmed]; 30 March 1432 \u2013 3 May 1481), commonly known as Mehmed the Conqueror (Ottoman Turkish: \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062a\u062d, romanized: Eb\u016b'l-fet\u1e25, lit.\u2009'the Father of Conquest'; Turkish: F\u00e2tih Sultan Mehmed), was an Ottoman sultan who ruled from August 1444 to September 1446, and then later from February 1451 to May 1481.\nIn Mehmed II's first reign, he defeated the crusade led by John Hunyadi after the Hungarian incursions into his country broke the conditions of the truce Peace of Szeged. When Mehmed II ascended the throne again in 1451, he strengthened the Ottoman navy and made preparations to attack Constantinople. At the age of 21, he conquered Constantinople and brought an end to the Byzantine Empire. After the conquest, Mehmed claimed the title Caesar of the Roman Empire (Ottoman Turkish: \u0642\u06cc\u0635\u0631\u200e \u0631\u0648\u0645, romanized: Qayser-i R\u00fbm), based on the fact that Constantinople had been the seat and capital of the surviving Eastern Roman Empire since its consecration in 330 AD by Emperor Constantine I. The claim was only recognized by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Nonetheless, Mehmed II viewed the Ottoman state as a continuation of the Roman Empire for the remainder of his life, seeing himself as \"continuing\" the Empire rather than \"replacing\" it.\nMehmed continued his conquests in Anatolia with its reunification and in Southeast Europe as far west as Bosnia. At home he made many political and social reforms, encouraged the arts and sciences, and by the end of his reign, his rebuilding program had changed Constantinople into a thriving imperial capital. He is considered a hero in modern-day Turkey and parts of the wider Muslim world. Among other things, Istanbul's Fatih district, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge and Fatih Mosque are named after him.\n\nSummary:\nRuled from August 1444 to September 1446, and then from February 1451 to May 1481\nDefeated the crusade led by John Hunyadi in 1444\nStrengthened the Ottoman navy and prepared to attack Constantinople in 1451\nConquered Constantinople at the age of 21, bringing an end to the Byzantine Empire\nClaimed the title Caesar of the Roman Empire\nContinued conquests in Anatolia and Southeast Europe, including Bosnia\nMade political and social reforms, encouraged arts and sciences, and rebuilt Constantinople into a thriving imperial capital\nViewed the Ottoman state as a continuation of the Roman Empire, seeing himself as continuing rather than replacing it\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nWe present a new convenient and efficient \"grafting from\" method to obtain well defined polystyrene (PS) silica nanoparticles. The method, based on Nitroxide-Mediated Polymerization (NMP), consists to bind covalently the alkoxyamine, which acts as initiator controller agent, at the silica nanoparticles surface in two steps. The first step is a reaction between the aminopropylsilane and the silica particles in order to functionalize the particles surface with amino group. In a second step, the initiating-controlling alkoxyamine moiety is introduced via an over grafting reaction between the amino group and the N-hydroxysuccinimide based MAMA-SG1 activated ester. To simplify both their chemical transformation and the polymerization step, the native silica particles, initially dispersed in water\n\nText continuation:\n, are first modified with aminopropylsilane to introduce amino groups on their surface. This modification enables the subsequent covalent binding of the alkoxyamine moiety, which serves as both an initiator and a controller for the polymerization reaction.\nThe resulting PS-silica nanoparticles exhibit a well-defined structure and a high degree of dispersion, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including biomedicine, catalysis, and optoelectronics. The grafting-from approach used in this method offers several advantages, including the ability to control the size and shape of the nanoparticles, as well as the molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymer chains. Additionally, the use of NMP allows for the synthesis of well-defined polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions, which is critical for many applications.\nFurthermore, the grafting-from method enables the incorporation of functional groups into the polymer chains, which can be used to tailor the properties of the nanoparticles. For example, the incorporation of hydrophilic groups can improve the dispersion of the nanoparticles in aqueous media, while the incorporation of hydrophobic groups can enhance their compatibility with organic solvents. The versatility of this method makes it an attractive approach for the synthesis of PS-silica nanoparticles with tailored properties for specific applications.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in \"Einstein\" becoming synonymous with \"genius\". Einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.\nIn 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass\u2013energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.\n\nSummary:\nAlbert Einstein, 14 March 1879 \u2013 18 April 1955 was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time.

He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education.\nFrom 1882 to 1922, Egypt was under British military occupation, and its government heavily under the influence (control) of the British Empire. The first Consul-General, Sir Evelyn Baring (later 1st Earl of Cromer), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian Ministry of Education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner.\nDunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant\n\nText continuation:\n) education system that would produce loyal and obedient citizens who would support British interests in the region. To achieve this, Dunlop introduced a number of reforms, including the creation of a new curriculum that emphasized Western-style education, the establishment of a network of schools and educational institutions, and the promotion of English language and culture.\nUnder Dunlop's guidance, the Egyptian education system was transformed, with a focus on producing students who were well-versed in Western subjects such as mathematics, science, and literature, but also familiar with British customs and values. The system was designed to produce a class of educated Egyptians who would be loyal to the British and supportive of their colonial rule. Dunlop's reforms were widely criticized by Egyptian nationalists, who saw them as a means of suppressing Egyptian culture and identity. Despite this, Dunlop's system remained in place for many years, shaping the course of Egyptian education and influencing the country's development for generations to come.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I know there are a lot of good resources out there, especially concerning rings training, but I want your opinion.\nHere is what Im looking at buying.\nAntraniks stuff\nRings of power (dragon door)\nOvercoming gravity (looks like the best bang for my buck considering all the material)\nBody by rings \nI searched and didmt find any good stuff. Let me know if I missed something, Im sure its been discussed.\nJreced: Pretty much everyone on here is gonna recommend you just stick to the RR. It works just fine and there's plenty of ring exercises. I'll assume you've already considered that\n\nText continuation:\nI understand your concern, Jreced. You're right, the Rings Routine (RR) is a great resource and a solid foundation for ring training. However, I'm looking for something more comprehensive and advanced. I've already mastered the basics and want to take my training to the next level.\nAfter further research, I came across some other programs that caught my attention. One of them is the \"Ring Training\" program by Antraniks. It's a comprehensive guide that covers a wide range of exercises, including some advanced ones like the \"ring muscle-up\" and \"ring L-sit\". The program also includes a workout plan and progressive overload guidelines, which I find very helpful.\nAnother program that I'm considering is the \"Rings of Power\" by Dragon Door. This program is specifically designed for ring training and includes a variety of exercises that target different muscle groups. It also includes a workout plan and some advanced techniques for more experienced trainers.\nI'm also looking at the \"Overcoming Gravity\" program, which is a more holistic approach to training. It covers not only ring exercises but also other forms of strength training and conditioning. The program is designed to help you build overall strength and fitness, rather than just focusing on ring training.\nFinally, I'm considering the \"Body by Rings\" program, which is a more specialized program that focuses specifically on ring training.

The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Summarize what GDP means as well as what it is and is not used for.\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced and sold in a specific time period by a country or countries, generally \"without double counting the intermediate goods and services used up to produce them\".[citation needed] GDP is most often used by the government of a single country to measure its economic health. Due to its complex and subjective nature, this measure is often revised before being considered a reliable indicator.[citation needed] GDP (nominal) per capita does not, however, reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore, using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) may be more useful when comparing living standards between nations, while nominal GDP is more useful comparing national economies on the international market. Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy. The ratio of GDP to the total population of the region is the per capita GDP (also called the Mean Standard of Living).\nGDP definitions are maintained by a number of national and international economic organizations. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines GDP as \"an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production and services (plus any taxes, and minus any subsidies, on products not included in the value of their outputs)\". An IMF publication states that, \"GDP measures the monetary value of final goods and services\u2014that are bought by the final user\u2014produced in a country in a given period of time (say a quarter or a year).\"\nGDP is often used as a metric for international comparisons as well as a broad measure of economic progress. It is often considered to be the world's most powerful statistical indicator of national development and progress. However, critics of the growth imperative often argue that GDP measures were never intended to measure progress, and leave out key other externalities, such as resource extraction, environmental impact and unpaid domestic work. Critics frequently propose alternative economic models such as doughnut economics which use other measures of success or alternative indicators such as the OECD's Better Life Index as better approaches to measuring the effect of the economy on human development and well being.\n\nSummary:\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) is a monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced and sold in a specific time period by a country or countries. It is often used by governments to measure a country's economic health and is a common metric for international comparisons and measuring economic progress. However, GDP is not a perfect measure, as it does not account for differences in cost of living and inflation rates between countries, and it may not accurately reflect a country's overall well-being.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "G", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\nWest's outspoken views have received significant media coverage; he has been a frequent source of controversy due to his conduct on social media and at awards shows and public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, race, and slavery. His Christian faith, high-profile marriage to Kim Kardashian, and mental health have also been topics of media attention. In 2020, West launched an unsuccessful independent presidential campaign that primarily advocated for a consistent life ethic. In 2022, he was widely condemned and lost many sponsors and partnerships\u2014including his collaborations with Adidas, Gap, and Balenciaga\u2014after making a series of antisemitic statements. In November 2022, he announced his 2024 presidential campaign, appearing publicly with Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist. West later publicly praised Adolf Hitler, denied the Holocaust, and identified as a Nazi.\n\nSummary:\nWest has been a source of controversy recently due to his conduct on social media and at awards shows and public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, race, and slavery. Additionally, he made a series of antisemitic statements in 2022, which led to widespread condemnation and the loss of many sponsors and partnerships.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

in a scheme backed by Ifad and Cafedirect - the farmers' fortunes have been transformed.\nBy coming together in co-operatives and by processing their cocoa, they have managed to get a much better return on their crop.\n\"Before Cafedirect I would work from day-to-day, hand-to-mouth,\" says Mr Esperansa.\n\"I did not think about the future.\"\nCafedirect head Anne MacCaig recently travelled to the islands to see how it was done.\n\"They have the facilities to ferment the product and then from that they are able to work together across the different organisations to dry the cocoa, collect it all in one central warehouse,\" she said.\n\"Then they are able to export it.\n\"They are benefiting from five times the price they had when they sold it as a gloopy white liquid.\"\nBefore the programme began in 2004, Sao Tome produced just 50 tonnes of cocoa.\nBy mid-2010 this had risen to 600 tonnes of organic, Fairtrade beans.\nMany producers have invested in home improvements and can now afford items like bicycles, generators, radios and refrigerators.\nThe co-operatives are investing in primary health-care clinics and better sanitation.\nBut is the support for the cocoa crop tying the farmers into a single crop, monoculture?\nMrs MacCaig says it will not.\n\"Sao Tome is an island with incredibly rich volcanic soil, so if you can do this with cocoa, there are so many other products that can be grown as well.\"\n\nSummary:\nSmall-scale cocoa farmers in Sao Tome and Principe have seen a 10-fold increase in production and income since 2004, thanks to the development of farmers' co-operatives and Fairtrade certification.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I don\u2019t know many body weigh workouts so I can\u2019t target individual groups like I normally do. If anyone has any I\u2019m missing as well please lmk :) \n\nAny help would be great \ud83d\udc4d\nchadtwashington: Depends on what you're training and what your level is. \nMike Tyson trained 6 days a week of massive amounts of reps in circuits but obviously built that over years.\nMFFKraven: And probably used peds\nchadtwashington: Source? \nDoubtful.\nMFFKraven: Bro everybody\n\nText continuation:\nAs a beginner, it's generally recommended to start with 2-3 times a week and gradually increase the frequency as your body adapts. However, if you're looking to make the most of your situation, you can definitely try doing bodyweight exercises daily. Just make sure to listen to your body and not overdo it.\nA good approach would be to focus on different muscle groups each day. For example, you could do push-ups and squats on Monday, back and shoulders on Tuesday, plank, leg raises, and sit-ups on Wednesday, and cardio on Thursday. This way, you'll be giving each muscle group a chance to recover before hitting them again.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is to vary your exercises and avoid repetitive movements. For instance, if you're doing push-ups every day, try mixing it up with diamond push-ups, decline push-ups, or even push-up variations that target different muscle groups.\nHere are some additional bodyweight exercises you can add to your routine:\n* Lunges: These target your legs and glutes, and can be done in various directions (front, side, and back).\n* Pull-ups: If you have a pull-up bar at home, you can do assisted pull-ups or use resistance bands to make it easier.\n* Dips: You can do dips using a chair, bench, or even a sturdy table.\n* Burpees: These are a full-body exercise that can be modified to suit your fitness level.\n* Mountain climbers: These are a great cardio exercise that target your legs and core.\nRemember to warm up before each workout and stretch afterwards to prevent injuries. It's also important to stay hydrated and fuel your body with a balanced diet.\nAs for Mike Tyson's training, it's true that he trained extensively, but it's also important to note that he was a professional athlete who had a team of trainers and coaches to help him develop his routine. As a beginner, it's essential to start with a manageable routine and gradually increase the intensity and frequency as you progress.\nIn conclusion, while it's possible to do bodyweight exercises daily, it's crucial to listen to your body and not overdo it. Make sure to vary your exercises, focus on different muscle groups, and incorporate rest days to allow your muscles to recover.

Sen. Hillary Clinton's eyes welled with tears as she spoke in New Hampshire Monday. At the close of a Portsmouth campaign stop, Marianne Pernold-Young, 64, asked Clinton: \"How do you do it? How do you keep up ... and who does your hair?\" Clinton said she had help with her hair on \"special days,\" and that she drew criticism on the days she did not. Then she added: \"It's not easy, and I couldn't do it if I just didn't, you know, passionately believe it was the right thing to do. \"You know, I have so many opportunities from this country, I just don't want to see us fall backwards,\" she said, her voice breaking a bit. The audience applauded. \"This is very personal for me, it's not just political, it's [that] I see what's happening, we have to reverse it,\" she said emotionally, adding that some \"just put ourselves out there and do this against some pretty difficult odds. \"But some of us are right and some of us are wrong. Some of us ready and some of us are not. Some of us know what we will do on day one, and some of us really haven't thought that through enough.\" \"So as tired as I am and I am. And as difficult as it is to try and keep up what I try to do on the road, like occasionally exercise and try to eat right -- it's tough when the easiest food is pizza -- I just believe so strongly in who we are as a nation. So I'm going to do everything I can and make my case and you know the voters get to decide.\"  Watch Clinton become emotional as she's answering a question \u00bb . The New York senator is under pressure after some weekend surveys show opponent Barack Obama with a sudden almost double digit lead, with less than a day to go until the New Hampshire primary. At a New Hampshire campaign event, presidential rival John Edwards told reporters he was unaware of Clinton's emotional reaction and would not respond to it. But he did say, \"I think what we need in a commander in chief is strength and resolve, and presidential campaigns are a tough business, but being president of the United States is also a very tough business. \"And the President of the United States is faced with very, very difficult challenges every single day, difficult judgments every single day.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nSummary:\nClinton begins talking about how others have criticized her, gets emotional\nShe was with mostly female voters in New Hampshire on a campaign stop\n\"It's not easy,\" she told them\nThe New York senator is trailing Sen.

The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\n2LateImDead: I'm trying to fix my blown speakers, but I can't figure out how to get the casings off!\n[removed]\nTramStopDan: Pics might help. \nProbably under a trim ring around the drivers.\n2LateImDead: https://cd5a26cb38e2f692acf4-1755b9e4a9778d68267568d15a55e9ec.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/53f667f3eb/84-1.jpg\njonvon65: Ehh, looks like the front grills are going to be glued around the edges. Once you get those off you'll likely find the metal speaker mounts screwed in directly to the box. Honestly though those speakers do look rather cheap and fixing them probably isn't worth the trouble. I would look around for new speakers instead, but that's just me. Either way, good luck!\n2LateImDead: Thanks for the response.  I wish I could get new speakers (I posted on some free stuff subs asking just a few minutes\n\nText continuation:\nago), but I've got no money to do so.  Either someone gives them to me or I manage to fix what I've got, else I've got nothing to work with.  :/\nIf I pry the grill off without damaging it, would normal superglue be good enough to put them back on so they don't look like crap?\njonvon65: Ahh, I see. The issue isn't getting the speakers open as much as fixing the blown drivers themselves. I haven't heard many success stories of blown drivers being restored. The only spare speakers I have are little mid rangers from my car (one of them pops when turned too loud but otherwise works fine). I would send them to you but they're 2.75 inches in diameter which is a lot smaller than the ones you have. Normal superglue probably wouldn't adhere that well to the front grills because it's a little too thin. Thicker glue like hot glue or gorilla glue would be better for this situation.\n2LateImDead: I might be able to get some Gorilla glue if it's even fixable.  Probably isn't though, like you said.  Thanks for the offer of those speakers from your car.  I'm pretty sure they're actually about the size of these ones - I shone a light through the mesh to look inside and these things are like 90% casing, the speaker inside is fairly small.  I don't have any exact measurements, though.\nDo you have an estimate of how much it'd cost to mail them?  I live in Virginia.  I don't really have any money because my job sucks and I'm going through college and supporting myself, but I could skip paying my phone bill this month to cover shipping costs, potentially.  But I can't imagine they'd be huge, even shipping from Asia is normally no more than $10, if it's something reasonably small.\njonvon65: Honestly, don't worry about the shipping, I've got you covered. I'm testing them out right now and they're not half bad. Also they're just bare speakers and I'd like to put them in an enclosure of some sort before I ship them. What would you be hooking them up to?\n2LateImDead: I've got an old Sony amplifier that uses the basic black and red speaker wires to hook things up.  It's also got RCA (yellow-white-red, minus the yellow since it's just audio) outputs and inputs.  I've got an AUX-RCA adapter to input sound.  I've never used the RCA outputs but I'm under the impression that they'd work the same, so whatever is easiest for you.\nThanks a bunch, by the way.  I've been really stressed about not having any speakers.  I'll still need to find more, but getting back 2 when I lost 4 cuts the loss in half, which is a big help.  And even 2 is enough to get back to practicing and recording.  :)\nI'll send you a PM with my address.\njonvon65: Ahh ok, good, that makes it easy then! Of course, just letting you know beforehand that these speakers are good quality but they are rather small, you won't be pissing off the neighbors with them. That being said, just don't turn them up too loud and you should be fine. I'll start on building the enclosures tomorrow and hopefully I can get them shipped out to you sometime this week. You're welcome!\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Approved", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The queen's birthday is actually April 21, but she officially celebrates it every year on a Saturday in June when good weather is more likely, according to Buckingham Palace. During the ceremony, which is open to the public, the queen inspects the troops. They then march past the queen, who rides in a carriage back to the palace. The Royal Air Force then conducts a colorful fly-past over Buckingham Palace while the queen and her family watch from the balcony. The queen has attended Trooping the Color every year of her reign except for one -- 1955, when a national rail strike canceled the event, the palace says. The ceremony gets its name from a tradition where colors of the battalion were carried, or \"trooped,\" down the ranks so they could be seen and recognized by the soldiers, Buckingham Palace says.\n\nSummary:\nQueen Elizabeth celebrates her 82nd birthday with a parade and military ceremony, \"Trooping the Color\", in London.\nThe ceremony is open to the public and features a colorful fly-past by the Royal Air Force.\nThe queen inspects the troops and watches from the balcony as they march past her.\nThe ceremony has been held every year of her reign, except for 1955 due to a national rail strike.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

They have a projected angular separation of 5.7\", corresponding to 800 AU at the distance of Taurus. To assess the nature of these two objects, we have obtained spectra of them and have constructed their spectral energy distributions. Both sources are young (~1 Myr) according to their Halpha emission, gravity-sensitive spectral features, and mid-IR excess emission. The proper motion of FU Tau A provides additional evidence of its membership in Taurus. We measure spectral types of M7.25 and M9.25 for FU Tau A and B, respectively, which correspond to masses of ~0.05 and ~0.015 M\\cdot according to\n\nText continuation:\nthe evolutionary models of Chabrier and Baraffe. FU Tau A is significantly overluminous relative to an isochrone passing through FU Tau B and relative to other members of Taurus near its spectral type, which may indicate that it is an unresolved binary. FU Tau A and B are likely to be components of a binary system based on the low probability (~3x10^-4) that Taurus would produce two unrelated brown dwarfs with a projected separation of a </- 6\". Barnard 215 contains only one other young star and is in a remote area of Taurus, making FU Tau A and B the first spectroscopically-confirmed brown dwarfs discovered forming in isolation rather than in a stellar cluster or aggregate. Because they were born in isolation and comprise a weakly bound binary, dynamical interactions with stars could not have played a role in their formation, and thus are not essential for the birth of brown dwarfs. ERRATUM: The K-band magnitude for FU Tau B in Table 1 is incorrect and should be 13.33. The bolometric luminosity of FU Tau B in Table 3 and Figure 5 is incorrect because of that mistake and a separate arithmetic error. The correct value of the luminosity is 0.0039 Lsun. FU Tau A and B exhibited different isochronal ages in the original Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in Figure 5, which was unexpected for members of a binary system. This discrepancy is reduced in the corrected version of Figure 5 since both objects are now above the isochrone for 1 Myr. Given the large uncertainties in model isochrones at such young ages, the positions of FU Tau A and B in Figure 5 could be roughly consistent with coevality.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

This is a rare condition, previously reported in only four families. In contrast, heterozygous GRN mutations are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia associated with neuronal cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. We identified homozygous GRN mutations in six new patients. The phenotypic spectrum is much broader than previously reported, with two remarkably distinct presentations, depending on the age of onset. A childhood/juvenile form is characterized by classical CLN11 symptoms at an early age at onset. Unexpectedly\n\nText continuation:\n, other homozygous patients presented a distinct delayed phenotype of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism after 50 years; none had epilepsy or cerebellar ataxia. Another major finding of this study is that all GRN mutations may not have the same impact on progranulin protein synthesis. A hypomorphic effect of some mutations is supported by the presence of residual levels of plasma progranulin and low levels of normal transcript detected in one case with a homozygous splice-site mutation and late onset frontotemporal dementia. This is a new critical finding that must be considered in therapeutic trials based on replacement strategies. The first neuropathological study in a homozygous carrier provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of the disease. Hallmarks of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were present. The absence of TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions markedly differs from observations of heterozygous mutations, suggesting a pathological shift between lysosomal and TDP-43 pathologies depending on the mono or bi-allelic status. An intriguing observation was the loss of normal TDP-43 staining in the nucleus of some neurons, which could be the first stage of the TDP-43 pathological process preceding the formation of typical cytoplasmic inclusions. Finally, this study has important implications for genetic counselling and molecular diagnosis. Semi-dominant inheritance of GRN mutations implies that specific genetic counseling should be delivered to children and parents of CLN11 patients, as they are heterozygous carriers with a high risk of developing dementia. More broadly, this study illustrates the fact that genetic variants can lead to different phenotypes according to their mono- or bi-allelic state, which is a challenge for genetic diagnosis.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The Texan family is trying to provide a more comfortable home and upbringing for these children. The Native American tribe is trying to preserve its culture. I don't fault the Texans for anything they're doing, except perhaps for the implicit assumption that a wealthier up-bringing is inherently superior to poorer childhood (wealth certainly is in advantage, but I don't think it's causally related to child happiness). I also don't fault the native American tribe for anything they're doing, with the history of explicit attempts to wipe out their cultural identity in the past. And in the middle, a brother and sister are separated by these two pulls.\nEdit: typos\n\nText continuation:\nAs the debate continues, it's essential to acknowledge the complex emotions and motivations involved. The Texan family, driven by a desire to provide a loving home, may not fully comprehend the cultural significance of preserving Native American heritage. Conversely, the Native American tribe, seeking to protect their children's cultural identity, may not fully grasp the emotional needs of the children themselves. Caught in the middle are the children, who are forced to navigate two vastly different worlds, torn between the comfort and security of their adoptive family and the cultural connection to their biological heritage.\nThe issue at hand is not solely about adoption or cultural preservation, but about the fundamental right of children to know and connect with their roots. The question remains: what is the best way to ensure that Native American children are able to grow up with a strong sense of identity and cultural connection? Should it be through adoption by a loving family, or through preservation of their cultural heritage within their own community?\nAs the debate rages on, it's crucial to remember that the fate of these children is not just a matter of legal or cultural significance, but also a matter of human compassion and empathy. The Texan family, the Native American tribe, and the children themselves all deserve our understanding, respect, and support.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nSelf-referential encoding is a method of organizing information in one's memory in which one interprets incoming information in relation to oneself, using one's self-concept as a background. Examples include being able to attribute personality traits to oneself or to identify recollected episodes as being personal memories of the past. The implications of self-referential processing are evident in many psychological phenomena. For example, the \"cocktail party effect\" notes that people attend to the sound of their names even during other conversation or more prominent, distracting noise. Also, people tend to evaluate things related to themselves more positively (This is thought to be an aspect of implicit self-esteem). For example, people tend to prefer their own initials over other letters. The\n\nText continuation:\nphenomenon of self-referential processing is also observed in the way people form impressions of others. Research has shown that people tend to attribute positive traits to individuals who share similar characteristics with themselves, such as personality traits, values, or interests. This is often referred to as the \"similarity-attraction hypothesis\". Additionally, people tend to form stronger social bonds with individuals who share similar self-concepts, as they feel a sense of connection and understanding with them. This can lead to the formation of close relationships and a sense of belonging. Furthermore, self-referential processing can also influence our perception of the world around us. For instance, people tend to perceive events and situations in a more positive light if they are related to themselves, even if the objective circumstances are the same. This can lead to a biased perception of reality, where individuals tend to see themselves as the central figure in the world.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Photographers surround singer Britney Spears' car in Los Angeles, California, in October. Kenneth Starr -- the independent counsel whose open-ended investigation of a Clinton land deal veered into an intimately detailed report on the president's affair with intern Monica Lewinsky -- is helping California lawmakers craft laws to crack down on celebrity-hunting packs of paparazzi. Malibu Mayor Pamela Conley Ulich contacted Starr, now a law school dean at Pepperdine University in Malibu. Local governments in Los Angeles and West Hollywood are also part of the effort to curb what they call a dangerous and expensive problem. \"Just imagine you're a motorist driving down the street and Britney Spears parks next to you; all of a sudden you're swarmed by these people,\" Los Angeles city Councilman Dennis Zine said. \"They've got cameras; they're jumping on the hood of my car. \"You don't know if you're getting carjacked. You don't know what's happening.\" The idea of a \"safe zone\" around celebrities has been kicked around by L.A.-area lawmakers for years. The push became more intense in the wake of multiple mob scenes around pop star Spears last year, including a virtual siege of her Studio City, California, home and similar scenes during her trips to hospitals. Starr has been in contact with the officials but is \"not ready to publicly comment\" on any plan he may have, according to a Pepperdine spokesperson. Lawmakers have set no timetable for when they'd like to have laws drafted. Police Chief William J. Bratton has argued that there's no need for new laws to deal with the problem. But Zine and others argue that police resources are stretched thin by the current state of things, citing $25,000 shelled out last year for a police escort for Spears. To some, Starr -- the man vilified by liberals for a lengthy and costly Clinton investigation that turned up Clinton's personal foibles but no major wrongdoing in the Whitewater land deals -- seems an odd partner for politicians in the notoriously left-leaning Los Angeles area. \"The irony is that he was so criticized, so vilified by Hollywood liberals 10 years ago during the Monica Lewinsky impeachment saga,\" said David Mark, a senior editor at Politico. \"Now he's kind of aligned himself with a lot of Malibu residents who probably disagree with him politically.\" But Zine, who has been a prime backer of laws curbing the \"Pap Packs,\" said Starr's expertise will be valuable as lawmakers try to strike a balance between public safety and First Amendment freedom of the press concerns. \"I have a lot of respect for Ken Starr,\" Zine said. \"We don't want to violate any rules. We don't want to violate the Constitution. \"We believe that the Constitution needs to be upheld [but] at the same time, we need to protect our celebrities.\" CNN's Carol Costello contributed to this report.\n\nSummary:\nKenneth Starr, former Clinton investigator, helps California lawmakers craft laws to curb paparazzi behavior.\nPhotographers swarm celebrities, causing safety concerns and financial burdens.\nLawmakers aim to create \"safe zones\" around celebrities, balancing public safety and First Amendment rights.\nStarr's expertise is sought to help lawmakers strike a balance between these competing concerns.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Prince William and his father, Prince Charles, at his graduation from the Royal Air Force in April. William, 25, will spend the first part of his attachment on a basic sea safety course training in sea survival, firefighting and ship damage repair, according to the ministry. If William passes the course, as expected, he will join the HMS Iron Duke in the Caribbean, the department said. The ship's function is to support overseas British territories in the event of a hurricane and to carry out counter-narcotic operations. The prince, who will be called Sub Lieutenant Wales in the Navy, is expected to spend time aboard a frigate, a mine hunter, a submarine and helicopters during his attachment, which ends August 1, the Ministry of Defense said. William completed a four-month attachment with the Royal Air Force this year and received his pilot's wings upon graduating in April. He learned to fly three different aircraft during the attachment and is known as Flying Officer Wales within the RAF. William is also a second lieutenant in the British Army, where he serves in the Blues and Royals regiment of the Household Cavalry. The attachments are designed to provide the prince with military experience for when he becomes head of the armed forces as king. \"When he becomes king, he needs to know his armed forces -- instinctively be very familiar with them -- and so he is doing this visit to the Royal Navy,\" said Rear Adm. Bob Cooling, the assistant chief of naval staff. William's father, Prince Charles, had a five-year career in the navy in the 1970s. Charles served on the guided missile destroyer HMS Norfolk and two frigates before qualifying as a helicopter pilot and joining a naval air squadron that operated from the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes. Prince Charles spent his last nine months in the navy in 1976 in command of the coastal minehunter HMS Bronington. William's uncle Prince Andrew served 22 years in the Royal Navy as a helicopter pilot, seeing active service during the Falklands War between Britain and Argentina in 1982. Queen Elizabeth II's husband, Prince Philip, William's grandfather, spent more than 13 years in the Royal Navy. He saw active service throughout World War II and was in Tokyo Harbor when Japan surrendered.\n\nSummary:\nBritain's Prince William begins two-month attachment with Royal Navy on Monday\nWilliam has completed attachment with the Royal Air Force\nThe future king is a second lieutenant in the British Army\nExperience will prepare him for when he becomes head of armed forces as king\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I was ~155-160 at my lowest weight at 6'5\" and I'm up to around 200 now. Unfortunately I don't get much exercise so I feel awful all the time.\nCaveat here is, I got whacked hard with the genetics stick. I have minor neuropathy in my legs on top of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. It makes my [joints](http://i.imgur.com/M1rLeU9.jpg) [hypermobile](http://i.imgur.com/nbjdcfq.jpg) and my skin is slightly stretchy. So my legs are pretty messed up and I'm getting physical therapy for them.\nI was wondering if there was any upper body routine I could do that has little if any lower body work involved alongside my at\n\nText continuation:\n-home therapy routine for my legs. For example, pushups are very difficult for me to do because it's hard to support myself with my legs in a pushup position.\nSorry if this violates rule 2. I've been wanting to start working out but haven't really been able to find any advice on it anywhere for someone in my situation.\nbipocni: I get downvotes every time I suggest this, but a simple pullup/dip workout is really all you need for the upper body.  Work up to 100 reps total each workout.  Once that gets easy, start adding weight.\nColoredMarxers: That is because most peoples goals focus around hypertrophy and strength. As soon as they hear something along the lines of \"30 minute abs\" or \"100 pushups a day\" They freak out because most of these programs are money/attention grabbing schemes, yet very rarely are they actually geared towards muscle endurance like they should be.\nbipocni: Unless I was in the business of selling chinup bars, parallell bars, rings or weight belts I don't see how I could profit from this.\nColoredMarxers: Oh no, I think you may have misconstrued my statement, i was simply mentioning that the reason you may have been downvoted is a knee-jerk response many people on this sub have built in concerning programs that *sound* like the one you suggested. I actually believe a sizable volume of dips and pullups (leg free workouts) would be beneficial and fitting for his goals/condition.\nbipocni: Yeah, it's pretty much the only two exercises that would work.\nFor otherwise healthy people you can literally just add 100 reps of weighted decline situps, and that's all the upper body strength training you need.  Add elbow conditioning and/or balance practice if your goals involve advanced calisthenics, but for simple strength/size it really is all you need.\nColoredMarxers: I would even go as far to possibly add some parallel bar or ring support work if he was up for it. Maybe even bar deadhangs for grip strength. It would be fun to integrate a little twist into a workout that could possibly get a bit tedious with time.\nbipocni: 100 dips &amp; pullups gets tedious like hill sprints get tedious.  It's hard, and it sucks, but you won't exactly get *bored*.\nDwas hangs and support work aren't strictly speaking necessary, but they could be fun.  There's also the capacity to do different *kinds* of pullups, like chins, mixed grip, neutral, offset, towel grip, ect.  Dips could at least be moved up to Russian dips occasionally.  There's definitely room for play, as long as the spirit of the thing is kept intact.\nColoredMarxers: 100% agree. It is great to see that, even with half of your body considered out of commission, you can still have a fun, useful, and varied workout. Great talk haha.\nbipocni: I had fun.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "assistant", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Josef Fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children. Investigators believe Fritzl planned to build the cellar as early as 1978, shortly after, according to his daughter, he began raping her at age 11 or 12, said police spokesman Franz Polzer. The 73-year-old Austrian began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year, and simply added the hidden space -- which was not recorded in any building plans -- Polzer said. It took Fritzl until 1983 to finish the addition, Polzer said. Investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison, which was blocked by a 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) steel and concrete door that Fritzl probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance, Polzer said. Fritzl, who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar, had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison. \"You would have to open up a total of eight doors, and ... (for the) last door which would go into this space (where the family was imprisoned), you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus,\" Polzer said. \"We will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we haven't discovered yet, and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting.\" Fritzl was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter, Elisabeth, captive in the dungeon under the Fritzl home for decades, repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children -- six of whom survived. Three of the children were adopted by Josef Fritzl and his wife after he concocted the ruse that Elisabeth had left the babies on their doorstep. The story of the family's imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago, when one of the children still in the dungeon, 19-year-old Kerstin Fritzl, fell seriously ill with convulsions. The father agreed to take her to a hospital, the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers. Dr. Albert Reiter, who is treating Kerstin, said Monday that while her condition is still \"grave,\" it \"has improved somewhat.\" \"She has become more stable, but despite that we have to continue to keep her under sedation and give her respiratory help,\" Reiter said, noting it is not clear how long she will be kept under sedation. Elisabeth and her two sons were reunited with her mother, Rosemarie, who police say knew nothing about the basement prison. They were also reunited with the three children that Josef had taken from Elisabeth. The reunited family is living in secluded quarters at a psychiatric clinic, where they are finding a daily routine and adjusting to sunlight -- something the two boys had never seen -- according to the clinic's chief doctor. \"The mother and the smallest child have, in just the last couple of days, increased their sensitivity to light,\" Dr. Berthold Kepplinger said. \"So we have been able to equip them with protective sunglasses.\" Five-year-old Felix is \"getting more and more lively,\" Kepplinger said. \"He's fascinated by everything that he sees around him -- the fresh air, the light, and the food -- all of these things are helping them,\" he said. \"Slowly the color of their skin is changing back to a more normal (shade).\" He also said the family members are still getting to know each other and live together as a family. Kepplinger praised Elisabeth for having provided a daily living routine for her children during their captivity. He said the family is getting into a new routine in which the mother and the grandmother make breakfast for the family, and the children make their beds. However, he said there is a noticeable difference between the pace of life of the children held in captivity and that of those who grew up in Fritzl's home. He said the mother, Elisabeth, takes breaks and naps several times a day. The health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying, Kepplinger said. Kepplinger said the children, after being confined to a small space their entire lives, are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces. Initially the dungeon where Fritzl held his daughter was only 35 square meters. In 1993, around the time Elisabeth was pregnant with her fourth child, Fritzl decided to add to the dungeon, building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters. On Wednesday or Thursday, prosecution authorities will attempt to question Fritzl -- who is no longer talking to police following his initial confession, state prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek said. A warden at the St. Poelten jail, where Fritzl is being held, told CNN that Fritzl appears to be doing well, but he is refusing to go on walks outside the building where he is detained.

Half of the continuations contain people's names and half don't, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nGiven a universe of discourse X-a domain of possible outcomes-an experiment may consist of selecting one of its elements, subject to the operation of chance, or of observing the elements, subject to imprecision. A priori uncertainty about the actual result of the experiment may be quantified, representing either the likelihood of the choice of :r_X or the degree to which any such X would be suitable as a description of the outcome. The former case corresponds to a probability distribution, while the latter gives a possibility assignment on X. The study of such assignments and their properties falls within the purview of possibility theory [DP88, Y80, Z783. It, like probability theory, assigns values between 0 and 1 to express likelihoods of outcomes. Here, however, the similarity ends. Possibility\n\nText continuation:\ntheory is concerned with the notion of possibility, which is distinct from probability. Possibility is a measure of the extent to which an event or outcome is possible, whereas probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event or outcome.\nIn possibility theory, the concept of possibility is defined in terms of a possibility distribution, which assigns to each element of the universe of discourse a degree of possibility between 0 and 1. This degree of possibility represents the extent to which the element is possible, or the degree to which it is a suitable description of the outcome. The possibility distribution is a function that maps each element of the universe of discourse to a value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents impossibility and 1 represents certainty.\nPossibility theory has several key features that distinguish it from probability theory. One of the most important features is the use of fuzzy sets to represent possibility distributions. In probability theory, events are represented as crisp sets, whereas in possibility theory, events are represented as fuzzy sets, which can have degrees of membership between 0 and 1. This allows possibility theory to capture the imprecision and vagueness that is often present in real-world problems.\nAnother key feature of possibility theory is the use of the concept of necessity. In possibility theory, the concept of necessity is used to represent the degree to which an event or outcome is necessary, or the degree to which it is a necessary condition for the occurrence of another event or outcome. This concept is distinct from the concept of probability, which is concerned with the likelihood of an event or outcome.\nPossibility theory has a wide range of applications in fields such as artificial intelligence, decision theory, and expert systems. In these applications, possibility theory is used to model and reason about uncertainty and imprecision, and to make decisions in the presence of incomplete or uncertain information.\nOne of the most important applications of possibility theory is in the field of expert systems. In expert systems, possibility theory is used to model the knowledge and expertise of a human expert, and to reason about the uncertainty and imprecision that is present in the expert's knowledge. This allows the expert system to make decisions and recommendations that are based on the expert's knowledge and expertise, even in the presence of incomplete or uncertain information.\nAnother important application of possibility theory is in the field of decision theory. In decision theory, possibility theory is used to model the uncertainty and imprecision that is present in decision-making, and to make decisions that are based on the available information. This allows decision-makers to make informed decisions that take into account the uncertainty and imprecision that is present in the decision-making process.\nIn conclusion, possibility theory is a powerful tool for modeling and reasoning about uncertainty and imprecision. It has a wide range of applications in fields such as artificial intelligence, decision theory, and expert systems, and it is used to make decisions and recommendations in the presence of incomplete or uncertain information.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\nMorocco has a wide range of biodiversity. It is part of the Mediterranean basin, an area with exceptional concentrations of endemic species undergoing rapid rates of habitat loss, and is therefore considered to be a hotspot for conservation priority. Avifauna are notably variant. The avifauna of Morocco includes a total of 454 species, five of which have been introduced by humans, and 156 are rarely or accidentally seen.\nThe Barbary lion, hunted to extinction in the wild, was a subspecies native to Morocco and is a national emblem. The last Barbary lion in the wild was shot in the Atlas Mountains in 1922. The other two primary predators of northern Africa, the Atlas bear and Barbary leopard, are now extinct and critically endangered, respectively. Relict populations of the West African crocodile persisted in the Draa river until the 20th century.\nThe Barbary macaque, a primate endemic to Morocco and Algeria, is also facing extinction due to offtake for trade human interruption, urbanisation, wood and real estate expansion that diminish forested area \u2013 the macaque's habitat.\nTrade of animals and plants for food, pets, medicinal purposes, souvenirs and photo props is common across Morocco, despite laws making much of it illegal. This trade is unregulated and causing unknown reductions of wild populations of native Moroccan wildlife. Because of the proximity of northern Morocco to Europe, species such as cacti, tortoises, mammal skins, and high-value birds (falcons and bustards) are harvested in various parts of the country and exported in appreciable quantities, with especially large volumes of eel harvested \u2013 60 tons exported to the Far East in the period 2009\u20122011.\n\nSummary:\nMorocco has a wide range of biodiversity, with 454 species of birds, including 5 introduced by humans and 156 that are rarely or accidentally seen.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nDouglas Dunlop was a Scottish teacher and missionary who, during the British occupation of Egypt (1888\u20131922), controversially created what became known as the 'Dunlop-system' in Egyptian education. He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education.\nFrom 1882 to 1922, Egypt was under British military occupation, and its government heavily under the influence (control) of the British Empire. The first Consul-General, Sir Evelyn Baring (later 1st Earl of Cromer), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian Ministry of Education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner.\nDunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant\n\nText continuation:\n) educated governing class and civil service, modelled on their experiences in British India. The education policy of the Egyptian government prior to the occupation had been to create a meritocratic system. Dunlop, on the other hand, oversaw the creation of an elitist two-tier system, with fees introduced for the elite schools. Modernisation also occurred, with elemental schooling being both centralised and expanded.\nPrior to the British occupation, the administrative languages of Egypt had been French and Turkish. With British influence, English became the preferred language. This brought increasing controversy, as Egyptian nationalists sought to reassert Arabic. Dunlop, even after thirty years in Egypt, like Cromer, did not speak Arabic. He primarily promoted teaching in English, preferring to employ British teachers and attempting to marginalise teaching in Arabic and French.\nIn 1907, Saad Zaghlul (later revolutionary leader and post-independence prime minister) became Minister of Education. Zaghul strongly promoted Arabic in education, and necessarily locking horns with his British advisor. Dunlop became a figure associated with British resistance to Egyptian anti-colonialism.

He was one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement, whose members were often called \"Tractarians\"; they aimed to reform the Church of England by reasserting its links with the early Catholic church.  The college was incorporated by royal charter dated 6 June 1870. Under its terms, the governance of the college was in the hands of the Warden (the head of the college) and a council of nine to twelve members; the Warden could veto almost any decision of the council and so was in a strong position. Other Oxford colleges, in contrast, were run by the head of the college and the Fellows. By keeping matters relating to religion and the college's internal\n\nText continuation:\naffairs separate, Keble College aimed to maintain a sense of unity and focus among its members. This unique governance structure allowed the college to maintain its distinct identity and values, which were deeply rooted in the Oxford Movement's ideals.\nOver the years, Keble College has continued to uphold its founding principles, fostering a community of scholars who are committed to academic excellence, spiritual growth, and social responsibility. The college has produced many notable alumni, including politicians, writers, and scientists, who have gone on to make significant contributions to their respective fields. Despite its small size, Keble College has played a significant role in shaping the University of Oxford and the wider academic community. Its unique blend of academic rigor, spiritual depth, and social commitment has made it a beacon of excellence and a source of inspiration for generations of students and scholars.\nToday, Keble College is a thriving community of over 700 students, with a diverse range of academic programs and research opportunities. The college is known for its strong sense of community and its commitment to supporting students in their academic and personal development. The college's beautiful buildings and gardens, which date back to the 19th century, provide a peaceful and inspiring environment for students to study, socialize, and relax. With its rich history, academic excellence, and commitment to social responsibility, Keble College remains a beloved and respected institution within the University of Oxford and beyond.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The colonists of Great Britain were tired of being taxed endlessly by King George lll. The revolution started when some of Britain's forces assaulted revolutionary colonists at Lexington. This convinced many people to fight for the colonists. Finally, after many long battles and suffering, at the battle of Yorktown in 1781, Great Britain's forces surrendered to General Roshambo and General Washington. King George lll passed the Treaty of Paris in 1783. The colonists, now free from Britain, started America. The political system was also created, with George Washington becoming the first president.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations. Half of the continuations contain people's names and half don't, but I don't know which is which. The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nLet $(\\{X_i(t)\\}_{i\\in \\mathbb{Z}^d})_{t\\geq 0}$ be the system of interacting diffusions on $[0,\\infty)$ defined by the following collection of coupled stochastic differential equations: \\begin{eqnarray}dX_i(t)=\\sum\\limits_{j\\in \\mathbb{Z}^d}a(i,j)[X_j(t)-X_i(t)] dt+\\sqrt{bX_i(t)^2} dW_i(t), \\eqntext{i\\in \\mathbb{Z}^d,t\\geq 0.}\\end{eqnarray} Here, $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is an irreducible random walk transition kernel on $\\mathbb{Z}^d\\times \\mathbb{Z}^d$, $b\\in (0,\\infty)$ is a diffusion parameter, and $(\\{W_i(t)\\}_{i\\in \\mathbb{Z}^d})_{t\\geq 0}$ is a collection of independent standard Brownian motions on $\\mathbb{R}$. The initial condition is chosen such that $\\{X_i(0)\\}_{i\\in \\mathbb{Z}^d}$ is a shift-invariant and shift-ergodic random field on $[0,\\infty)$ with mean $\\Theta\\in (0,\\infty)$ (the evolution\n\nText continuation:\npreserves the mean). We show that the long-time behavior of this system is the result of a delicate interplay between $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ and $b$, in contrast to systems where the diffusion function is subquadratic. In particular, let $\\hat{a}(i,j)={1/2}[a(i,j)+a(j,i)]$, $i,j\\in \\mathbb{Z}^d$, denote the symmetrized transition kernel. We show that: (A) If $\\hat{a}(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is recurrent, then for any $b>0$ the system locally dies out. (B) If $\\hat{a}(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is transient, then there exist $b_*\\geq b_2>0$ such that: (B1)d The system converges to an equilibrium $\\nu_{\\Theta}$ (with mean $\\Theta$) if $0<b<b_*$. (B2) The system locally dies out if $b>b_*$. (B3) $\\nu_{\\Theta}$ has a finite 2nd moment if and only if $0<b<b_2$. (B4) The 2nd moment diverges exponentially fast if and only if $b>b_2$. The equilibrium $\\nu_{\\Theta}$ is shown to be associated and mixing for all $0<b<b_*$. We argue in favor of the conjecture that $b_*>b_2$. We further conjecture that the system locally dies out at $b=b_*$. For the case where $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is symmetric and transient we further show that: (C) There exists a sequence $b_2\\geq b_3\\geq b_4\\geq ... >0$ such that: (C1) $\\nu_{\\Theta}$ has a finite $m$th moment if and only if $0<b<b_m$. (C2) The $m$th moment diverges exponentially fast if and only if $b>b_m$. (C3) $b_2\\leq (m-1)b_m<2$. uad(C4) $\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}(m-1)b_m=c=\\sup_{m\\geq 2}(m-1)b_m$. The proof of these results is based on self-duality and on a representation formula through which the moments of the components are related to exponential moments of the collision local time of random walks. Via large deviation theory, the latter lead to variational expressions for $b_*$ and the $b_m$'s, from which sharp bounds are deduced. The critical value $b_*$ arises from a stochastic representation of the Palm distribution of the system. The special case where $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is simple random walk is commonly referred to as the parabolic Anderson model with Brownian noise. This case was studied in the memoir by Carmona and Molchanov [Parabolic Anderson Problem and Intermittency (1994) Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI], where part of our results were already established.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nInterest in the application of engineering methods to problems in congenital heart disease has gained increased popularity over the past decade. The use of computational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single ventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of pacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the biomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing in clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In practice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each other's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD) the main steps involved in performing\n\nText continuation:\ncomputational simulation-from the selection of an appropriate clinical question/problem to understanding the computational results, and all of the \"black boxes\" in between. We examine the current state of the art and areas in need of continued development. For example, medical image-based model-building software has been developed based on numerous different methods. However, none of them can be used to construct a model with a simple \"click of a button\". The creation of a faithful, representative anatomic model, especially in pediatric subjects, often requires skilled manual intervention. In addition, information from a second imaging modality is often required to facilitate this process. We describe the technical aspects of model building, provide a definition of some of the most commonly used terms and techniques (e.g. meshes, mesh convergence, Navier-Stokes equations, and boundary conditions), and the assumptions used in running the simulations. Particular attention is paid to the assignment of boundary conditions as this point is of critical importance in the current areas of research within the realm of congenital heart disease. Finally, examples are provided demonstrating how computer simulations can provide an opportunity to \"acquire\" data currently unobtainable by other modalities, with essentially no risk to patients. To illustrate these points, novel simulation examples of virtual Fontan conversion (from preoperative data to predicted postoperative state) and outcomes of different surgical designs are presented. The need for validation of the currently employed techniques and predicted results are required and the methods remain in their infancy. While the daily application of these technologies to patient-specific clinical scenarios likely remains years away, the ever increasing interest in this area among both clinicians and engineers makes its eventual use far more likely than ever before and, some could argue, only a matter of [computing] time.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Lewis Hamilton will be able to afford a lot more champagne in the future. The Briton is set to become one of the most marketable sport stars in the world -- perhaps second only to Tiger Woods -- and earn more than a billion dollars if he can maintain the buzz created by his first season in Formula One, experts say. On Sunday he started his second season in perfect fashion, easily winning the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. The 23-year-old signed a five-year contract with McLaren worth an estimated $140m in January. It leaves him lagging along way behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who is paid an estimated $50m a year for driving, but it is through endorsements that he stands to reap a greater windfall. Stephen Cheliotis, chief executive of the Centre for Brand Analysis and UK Superbrands and CoolBrands Councils' chairman, said Hamilton was the most marketable driver because he was a breath of fresh air. He had helped drive up race attendance and television fewer figures dramatically in his first season. \"He is young, mixing with the right people everyday -- rappers, film stars -- and a lot more articulate than Kimi Raikkonen,\" Cheliotis said. \"He is also the first black driver and it does have a bearing, much like Tiger Woods in golf. He is also the most marketable because he is going to be the best, much like Michael Schumacher.\" Pippa Collett, Sponsorship Consulting's managing director, said Hamilton was certainly the most marketable driver in the short term. His performance meant he was the dominant member of a group of \"young turks\" -- Nelson Piquet Jr, Nico Rosberg, Heikki Kovalainen -- who had great potential. Collett said in terms of the media Hamilton's performance, friendliness, English speaking background and professionalism were key assets. If he could maintain these he would earn more than Schumacher -- the sport's first billionaire driver. Indeed, Schumacher set an example which Hamilton would be wise to follow. He was the first driver to win personal sponsors after Ferrari allowed him to sign a $10m annual deal with a German bank to place its logo on his cap. The German also actively pursued the development of his own retail range, which included caps -- he sold hundreds of thousands at $30 a pop -- and even a branded vacuum cleaner. Collett said Schumacher's manager, Willi Weber, was very good. \"Schumacher was a nice guy but not very charming. However, he was very professional and you knew he would turn up,\" Collett said. Cheliotis agreed Hamilton would earn considerably more than Schumacher, and that there would be a big gap between his earnings and that of the other drivers. However, there were pitfalls. Lewis had already made the mistake of saying he was moving to Switzerland to avoid the limelight when it was all about avoiding tax, Cheliotis said. \"He said that and then turned up at every awards night for a month.\" Cheliotis said appearing arrogant, being caught out by the tabloid press, endorsing a brand and then using another and over selling himself could also damage his value. \"The big danger with someone like Hamilton is that he is so in demand and that he has so many sponsors it leads to brand confusion. There is a danger of being one of 50 sponsors and not getting any value.\" Collett said Hamilton needed to develop his \"life-time brand\". While Raikkonen may not be a media darling he had developed an \"Iceman\" image, which was just as important in the long term. English footballer David Beckham, whose performance had dropped off, had successfully developed a life-time brand that would out last his playing career. Collett said Hamilton's one weakness may be his father, Anthony. \"His dad is his manager. Your brand positioning is as an individual... having your dad around too much could affect your brand.\" Collett said Hamilton would have to be wary of bad press, but a little bit of young turk behaviour could enhance his image as long as he continued to excel. \"I think that is part of the glamour... some of that and continued brilliant performances will make his life very easy.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nSummary:\nLewis Hamilton signs 5-year contract with McLaren worth $140m.\nHe's expected to become one of the most marketable sports stars, earning over $1 billion.\nHamilton's articulate, young, and charismatic, making him a breath of fresh air in Formula One.\nHe's poised to surpass Michael Schumacher's earnings, becoming the sport's highest-paid driver.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "assistant", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nChoosing the Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) ternary alloy for thin films solar cells might yield high benefits concerning efficiency and reliability, because its bandgap can be tuned through the Indium composition and radiations have little destructive effect on it. It may also reveal challenges because good quality p-doped InGaN layers are difficult to elaborate. In this letter, a new design for an InGaN thin film solar cell is optimized, where the player of a PIN structure is replaced by a Schottky contact, leading to a Metal-IN (MIN) structure. With a simulated efficiency of 19.8%, the MIN structure performs better than the previously studied Schottky structure, while increasing its fabrication tolerance and thus functional reliability a. Owing to its good tolerance to radiations [1], its\n\nText continuation:\npotential for use in space-based solar power systems is significant. The MIN structure's improved radiation resistance could enable it to withstand the harsh conditions of space, making it an attractive option for future space-based solar power applications.\nThe MIN structure's design also offers improved thermal stability, which is essential for space-based solar power systems where the solar panels are exposed to extreme temperatures. The Schottky contact in the MIN structure helps to reduce the thermal resistance, allowing the solar cell to operate efficiently even in high-temperature environments. Additionally, the MIN structure's design is more scalable than traditional PIN structures, making it easier to manufacture and integrate into larger solar power systems. Overall, the MIN structure's improved efficiency, radiation resistance, and thermal stability make it an attractive option for future space-based solar power applications.\nIn conclusion, the MIN structure's design offers a promising solution for improving the efficiency and reliability of thin film solar cells. Its potential for use in space-based solar power systems is significant, and its improved radiation resistance and thermal stability make it an attractive option for future space-based solar power applications. Further research is needed to fully understand the MIN structure's potential and to optimize its design for specific space-based solar power applications.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Approved", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\nPhotosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that, through cellular respiration, can later be released to fuel the organism's activities. Some of this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water \u2013 hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek ph\u014ds (\u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2), \"light\", and synthesis (\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), \"putting together\". Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called Photoautotroph. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.\n\nSummary:\nPhotosynthesis is performed differently by different species but the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers that contain green chlorophyll (and other colored) pigments/chromophores. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.\nIn plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other bacteria, different mechanisms such as the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Aware of the links between natural, monetary and productive aggregates, we propose the development of ''eco-systemic'' prudential policies by exposing the interdependence between macro, micro and environmental prudential measures. These would be based on a reorientation of corporate accounting standards towards the concept of socio-environmental solvency, notably the CARE-TDL model (integration of human and natural capital alongside financial capital on the liabilities side of the balance sheet). In an ecosystemic framework, this solvency of virtuous\n\nText continuation:\ncompanies would be evaluated through a set of indicators, such as the ratio of ecological to financial returns, and the capacity to absorb environmental risks. This would enable a more accurate assessment of their financial health and, subsequently, a more informed decision-making process by investors, regulators, and other stakeholders.\nFurthermore, the adoption of eco-systemic prudential policies would also encourage the development of new financial instruments and products that take into account the environmental and social dimensions of companies' activities. For instance, green bonds, which are specifically designed to finance environmentally friendly projects, could be used to channel funds towards sustainable infrastructure development. Similarly, impact investing, which aims to generate both financial returns and positive social or environmental impact, could become a more prominent feature of the financial landscape.\nBy promoting eco-systemic prudential policies, we can create a more sustainable and resilient financial system that supports the transition to a low-carbon economy. This would require a coordinated effort from policymakers, regulators, financial institutions, and companies to develop and implement new standards, frameworks, and instruments that reflect the interdependence between economic, environmental, and social dimensions.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Approved", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nsplashysoup: How do I permanently and politely turn down someone who I will have to bear for many years to come?\nSo, a guy (20sM) in my class asked me (25F) on a date about a month ago and I turned him down giving him two reasons (both true): I don't see him that way and I have a boyfriend. He answered that he understands, and that was it. UNTIL. \nAnyway, prior to this I was inviting him to join the others in group activites etc because it seemed he was always left out, maybe because he is the only guy or maybe because he's not speaking the language very well. I guess he took it as a hint of me being interested. I nevertheless very explicitly (over text) turned his date invitation down, giving my two reasons. \nToday he was about to be left out once again in a group assignment and was kinda\n\nText continuation:\njust looking lost so I invited him to join our group. After this followed some pretty heavy flirting on his part. I avoided eye contact with him, turned my attention to the other group members instead, answered him only shortly etc. He continued flirting after class, asking to \"see my necklace\". I told him \"no, I don't feel comfortable with that because you'd be getting really close to me\". He apologised if what he said made me feel uncomfortable, I just told him we're good now but I just don't want that stuff.\nI know how to set my boundaries but I'm a bit unsure how to assert my stance to him permanently. Should I not include him next time he seems lost? Is my friendliness doomed to be an invitation in his eyes? No one else in our course does anything to include him and I feel so bad about that. It's very unnatural to me to not include people like that but I guess I have to dismiss him more since he seems to interpret me wrong every time, right? I have told him very clearly that I am just being generally friendly and he is there everyday when I treat everybody with the same niceness as him. Should I say something more to him about this? \nI am going to meet him like multiple times a week for the next 4 years in our tiny ass class so I can't do anything crazy. I'm so stressed out about this. \nTL;DR a classic story: I was friendly to a loner guy in my class, he asked me out, I turned him down, he continues flirting. Should I be colder towards him because being a friendly seems to encourage him?\nnopiepoopi: I just wanted to say I think it could be worth bringing up with your other friends/classmates how they don\u2019t include him. \nJust discuss with them and ask them why they don\u2019t include him. Is there any reason? Are they genuinely just overlooking him? If so, maybe they can help you with including him too.

Seriously\njb20x6: If this is our *best*, we're delusional af.\nDukeofDixieland: Which decade would you consider to be better than 2010 - 2020?\njb20x6: 1990-2000.  A lot of bad things happened then too, but still better than this decade.\nomega884: Eh... here's just some of the crap that happened in the 1990's:\nGulf War, two wars in the Congo, Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Rwandan Genocide (500,000 + dead), Rodney King riots, WTC bombing, Oklahoma City bombing, Unabomber, IRA violence in the early part of the decade, hurricanes Andrew and Fran, Japan's economy went into a recession, American auto manufacturing continued its decline, Columbine began the age of school shootings, Matthew Shepard (among other LGBT individuals) were killed\n\nText continuation:\nDukeofDixieland: I see your point, omega884. You're right, the 1990s were a tumultuous time with a lot of conflicts and tragedies. But, in my opinion, the 2010s had their own set of challenges and issues that made it a difficult decade as well.\njb20x6: Like what? The 2010s were a cakewalk compared to the 1990s.\nDukeofDixieland: Well, for one, the 2010s saw a rise in global terrorism, with ISIS and other extremist groups wreaking havoc in the Middle East and beyond. We also had the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which was a major public health crisis. And let's not forget the devastating impact of Hurricane Harvey and Maria on the United States and Puerto Rico, respectively.\nomega884: Yeah, those were all serious issues, but they're not exactly comparable to the scale and scope of the conflicts and tragedies in the 1990s. I mean, we didn't have a genocide on our hands, and we didn't have to deal with the threat of nuclear war like we did during the Cold War.\njb20x6: That's a fair point, omega884. But, in my opinion, the 2010s had their own unique set of challenges that made it a difficult decade. For one, we saw a rise in social media and the 24-hour news cycle, which created a culture of constant information overload and anxiety. We also had the rise of fake news and disinformation, which eroded trust in institutions and made it difficult to discern fact from fiction.\nDukeofDixieland: That's a great point, jb20x6. The 2010s were definitely marked by a shift in the way we consume and process information, and it's had a profound impact on our society. And let's not forget the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been a major global health crisis and has disrupted economies and societies around the world.\nomega884: Yeah, the 2010s were definitely marked by a lot of challenges and uncertainties. But, in my opinion, the 1990s were still a more tumultuous and chaotic time. I mean, we had a global recession, wars in multiple countries, and a rise in extremist violence. It was a decade that tested the limits of human endurance and resilience.\njb20x6: I see what you're saying, omega884. The 1990s were definitely a challenging time, and it's hard to argue with the fact that they were more tumultuous than the 2010s. But, at the same time, I think we can learn from the challenges of the 2010s and use them to build a better future for ourselves.\nDukeofDixieland: I couldn't agree more, jb20x6. The 2010s may not have been the most ideal decade, but they've taught us a lot about resilience, adaptability, and the importance of coming together as a global community to address our challenges. And who knows, maybe the 2020s will be the decade that brings us even greater challenges and opportunities for growth and progress.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Maybe you can try posting on some local Facebook groups or online forums to see if anyone has any leads on free or cheap speakers. You never know, you might get lucky and find someone giving away a pair. And if all else fails, you could always try contacting some local audio repair shops to see if they have any used or refurbished speakers they'd be willing to sell. Good luck with your search!\n2LateImDead: Yeah, I'll definitely try posting on some local groups and forums.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nIn this paper, we introduce a new learning strategy based on a seminal idea of Mojirsheibani (1999, 2000, 2002a, 2002b), who proposed a smart method for combining several classifiers, relying on a consensus notion. In many aggregation methods, the prediction for a new observation x is computed by building a linear or convex combination over a collection of basic estimators r1(x),. .. , rm(x) previously calibrated using a training data set. Mojirsheibani proposes to compute the prediction associated to a new observation by combining selected outputs of the training examples. The output of a training example is selected if some kind of consensus is observed: the predictions computed for the training example with the different machines have to be \"similar\" to the prediction for the new observation\n\nText continuation:\n.\nThis approach has been shown to be effective in various applications, including image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The key idea is to identify the most relevant training examples that are similar to the new observation, and then combine their outputs to make a prediction. This can be done by using a distance metric, such as the Euclidean distance, to measure the similarity between the new observation and the training examples. The training examples that are closest to the new observation are then selected and their outputs are combined to make a prediction.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach to selecting the most relevant training examples, based on a clustering algorithm. We use a k-means clustering algorithm to group the training examples into clusters, and then select the cluster that is closest to the new observation. This approach has been shown to be effective in reducing the computational complexity of the aggregation method, while maintaining its accuracy.\nWe also propose a novel method for combining the outputs of the selected training examples, based on a weighted average. We use a weighted average to combine the outputs of the selected training examples, where the weights are determined by the similarity between the new observation and the training examples. This approach has been shown to be effective in improving the accuracy of the aggregation method, by giving more importance to the training examples that are most similar to the new observation.\nIn conclusion, we propose a novel learning strategy based on the idea of Mojirsheibani (1999, 2000, 2002a, 2002b), which combines the outputs of several classifiers by selecting the most relevant training examples and combining their outputs using a weighted average. This approach has been shown to be effective in various applications, including image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Cyberattacks against AI systems can leverage AI specific assets, such as training data sets (e.g. data poisoning) or trained models (e.g. adversarial attacks or membership inference), or exploit vulnerabilities in the AI system\u2019s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures, such as security controls, should therefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also taking into account as appropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure. As part of Union harmonisation legislation, rules applicable to the placing\n\nText continuation:\non the market of AI systems should be established, taking into account the specific characteristics of AI systems and their potential impact on the internal market.\nFor instance, the European Union has already taken steps to address the cybersecurity risks associated with AI systems. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive aim to ensure that AI systems are designed and developed with security in mind, and that they are subject to regular security testing and monitoring. Furthermore, the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act proposes to establish a set of rules for the development, deployment and use of AI systems, including requirements for transparency, explainability and accountability.\nIn addition to these legislative measures, the development and deployment of AI systems should also be guided by industry-recognized best practices and standards. For example, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has developed a set of standards for the security and reliability of AI systems, including ISO 30111:2020, which provides guidelines for the development and testing of AI systems. Similarly, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has developed a set of standards for the cybersecurity of AI systems, including IEC 62443-4-2, which provides guidelines for the secure development and deployment of AI systems.\nBy taking a proactive and comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, the development and deployment of AI systems can be made safer and more secure, and the risks associated with these systems can be minimized.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nDuring a survey for stars with disks in the Taurus star-forming region using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we have discovered a pair of young brown dwarfs, FU Tau A and B, in the Barnard 215 dark cloud. They have a projected angular separation of 5.7\", corresponding to 800 AU at the distance of Taurus. To assess the nature of these two objects, we have obtained spectra of them and have constructed their spectral energy distributions. Both sources are young (~1 Myr) according to their Halpha emission, gravity-sensitive spectral features, and mid-IR excess emission. The proper motion of FU Tau A provides additional evidence of its membership in Taurus. We measure spectral types of M7.25 and M9.25 for FU Tau A and B, respectively, which correspond to masses of ~0.05 and ~0.015 M\\cdot according to\n\nText continuation:\nour spectral analysis.\nFurther analysis of the spectra reveals that both FU Tau A and B exhibit a strong Halpha emission line, which is indicative of ongoing accretion and disk activity. The Halpha equivalent width of FU Tau A is 20 \u00c5, while that of FU Tau B is 15 \u00c5, suggesting that FU Tau A is more actively accreting material from its disk. The gravity-sensitive spectral features, such as the lithium absorption line, also indicate that both objects are young and still contracting towards the main sequence.\nThe mid-IR excess emission observed in both sources is likely due to the presence of warm dust in their disks. The SEDs of FU Tau A and B are similar, with a peak at around 10 \u03bcm, suggesting that they have similar disk properties. However, the SED of FU Tau A is slightly more prominent in the near-IR, which may indicate a more massive disk.\nOur findings suggest that FU Tau A and B are two young brown dwarfs with disks, likely in the early stages of disk evolution. The detection of Halpha emission and mid-IR excess emission in both sources indicates that they are actively accreting material from their disks, and their spectral types and masses are consistent with their young ages. Further study of these objects can provide valuable insights into the disk evolution and planet formation processes in the Taurus star-forming region.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Based on this paragraph, tell me who was responsible for the discovery of nuclear fission.\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\nNuclear fission of heavy elements was discovered on Monday 19 December 1938 in Berlin, by German chemist Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann in cooperation with Austrian-Swedish physicist Lise Meitner. Hahn understood that a \"burst\" of the atomic nuclei had occurred. Meitner explained it theoretically in January 1939 along with her nephew Otto Robert Frisch. Frisch named the process by analogy with biological fission of living cells. In their second publication on nuclear fission in February of 1939, Hahn and Strassmann predicted the existence and liberation of additional neutrons during the fission process, opening up the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction.\n\nSummary:\nOtto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann achieved nuclear fission in the laboratory, but could not explain what had happened. It was Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch that interpreted the laboratory results and discovered that nuclear fission had occurred.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\n\"Xiaolongbao\" originated in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, by Wan Hua Tea House in the years of Daoguang Emperor (1820 to 1850). Xiaolongbao evolved from the guantangbao (soup-filled dumplings/buns) from Kaifeng, Henan province, the capital city of Northern Song Dynasty (AD 960\u20131127).\nThere are numerous styles of xiaolongbao in Jiangsu cuisine. Shanghai-style xiaolongbao originated in Nanxiang, which was a neighboring village of Shanghai in Jiangsu that eventually ended up becoming an outer suburb of Shanghai's Jiading District. The inventor of xiaolongbao sold them in his first store in Nanxiang next to the town's notable park, Guyi Garden. From there the xiaolongbao expanded into downtown Shanghai and outward. The Suzhou and Wuxi styles are larger (sometimes twice as large as a Nanxiang-style soup dumpling) and have sweeter fillings. The Nanjing style is smaller with an almost translucent skin and less meat.\n\nSummary:\nXiaolongbao were first seen in Chengzhou which is located in Jiangsu province.\nSince it's humble beginnings it has spread far and wide and there exist many variants.\nA few common types are the:\n- Shanghai Style\n- Suzhou Style\n- Wuxi Style\n- Nanjing Style\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Shame on those judgemental bums\nlightknight7777: I think it's important to understand that these people grew up being fed these answers by the government. It's easy to get mad at them,  but they're victims too. I can't imagine not being able to appreciate women and yet their society saw fit to rob them of that through ignorance and misdirection. Women absolutely have it worse, but direct your anger at the government and programs that made them this way, first and foremost.\nSakuraba85: Would you say the same thing about Hitler?\nlightknight7777: Hitler formed the society that overthrew\n\nText continuation:\nthe values of empathy and compassion, and created an environment where hatred and prejudice were not only tolerated but encouraged. The people who followed him were victims of his propaganda and manipulation, but that doesn't excuse their actions. They were complicit in his crimes and should be held accountable.\nBut let's get back to Najmia and her bravery. She's not just a victim of harassment, but also a symbol of resistance against the oppressive forces that seek to control her and other women. Her refusal to wear the hijab is a powerful statement against the patriarchal society that seeks to dictate what she can and cannot wear.\nNajmia's story is not unique, there are many other women and girls around the world who are fighting against similar forms of oppression. They are the ones who are challenging the status quo, who are pushing against the boundaries of what is considered acceptable, and who are refusing to be silenced.\nBut Najmia's story is also a reminder that we must not forget the victims of oppression, we must not forget the ones who are still suffering under the weight of patriarchy and misogyny. We must continue to fight for their rights, for their freedom, and for their dignity.\nAnd so, let us continue to stand with Najmia, and with all the women and girls who are fighting for their rights. Let us continue to speak out against oppression, and let us continue to work towards a world where everyone is treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender, religion, or any other characteristic.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Would they really turn their backs on the UK as a holiday destination as a recent poll suggests?\nSimon Calder, travel editor of The Independent, said: \"It is not unreasonable for people on the continent to feel a bit miffed with the result of the EU vote.\n\"Effectively we were saying, 'We don't want to play' and therefore, of course, there will be a number of people who will say, 'Right, well if you don't want to be part of our great economic experiment, then we don't want to come on holiday to your country'.\n\"I think a bigger worry, actually, are people who will infer for some reason - maybe all the rhetoric that was going on at the time of the referendum - that somehow they'll need a visa to come to Scotland.\n\"It's very unlikely that the traditional Scottish markets will need that but it might deter some people.\"\nThe numbers of tourists coming to Scotland's shores is just one side of the coin.\nIncreasingly, the staff serving them in the cafes and making the beds in the hotels are from other EU states, especially eastern and central Europe.\nRestaurant worker Erik Harrmann, from the Czech Republic, said he was shocked and baffled by the Brexit vote.\n\"I was surprised.

He now plays as a right-handed batter for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. He is widely recognised as one of the best batsman in cricket history. He is the second most prolific international century batsman in cricket history. The International Cricket Council elected him the male cricketer of the decade despite holding the record for most runs in T20 internationals and the IPL.

Its design clearly separates explicit and symbolic directed exploration algorithms from the set of on-line and off-line computed estimates and associated data structures. MIPS has shown distinguished performance in the last two international planning competitions. In the last event the description language was extended from pure propositional planning to include numerical state variables, action durations, and plan quality objective functions. Plans were no longer sequences of actions but time-stamped schedules. As a participant of the fully automated track of the competition, MIPS has proven to be a general system; in each track\n\nText continuation:\n, it demonstrated its ability to adapt to different problem domains and scales, from simple to complex scenarios.\nThe system's modular architecture allows for easy extension and modification of its components, making it a versatile tool for various applications. Its robustness and flexibility have been demonstrated through its successful participation in multiple competitions, where it has consistently produced high-quality plans. The extension of the description language to include numerical state variables and action durations has enabled MIPS to tackle a broader range of planning problems, including those that require reasoning about time and resources.\nIn addition to its performance in planning competitions, MIPS has also been used in various real-world applications, such as scheduling and resource allocation in manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. Its ability to handle complex planning problems and generate high-quality plans has made it a valuable tool for organizations seeking to optimize their operations and improve their decision-making processes. As a result, MIPS has become a widely recognized and respected system in the field of artificial intelligence and planning, and its contributions have had a significant impact on the development of planning algorithms and techniques.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says journalists don't serve the public if they push rumors. (CNN) -- Two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the Internet. One week before comedian Bernie Mac passed away, text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died. I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead. The rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times. What makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition. Then there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards. The story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging. Ultimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened. There has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\" Sorry, Rick, I disagree. The most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control. Running with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion. The rumors kept going and going\u00ad and when the story hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire. In one week, Bear Stearns was no more, and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the Wall Street behemoth. We should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story. The rules are simple: Either you have the facts or you don't. If you do, you run with the story. If you don't, you leave it alone. The National Enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront Edwards as he was leaving the Beverly Hills Hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair. Then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the Enquirer said was the child of the mistress. With other major media outlets turning up the heat, Edwards admitted the affair in an interview with ABC's Bob Woodruff. No media executive should be pulling his or her hair out, trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor. If they had, and the facts didn't support the rumor, then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more. We have an obligation to stick with the facts, and nothing else. And no matter what a blogger, Web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with, the day we choose to alter our standards, our credibility and integrity will be shot. In the end, as former ABC News anchor Max Robinson said in 1988, that's all we've got. Nothing is worth losing that, even getting the scoop on an affair involving a candidate whose political career is likely over. Roland S. Martin is an award-winning journalist and CNN contributor.

He's in his last year, I'm 2 years under his. \nI'd like to go and speak to him without sounding weird or off. I'm pretty good at socialising normally but I become very shy for certain people. \nThere's an aura surrounding him if that makes sense?\nI'm interested in an amicable way. \nAny tips? Did a similar situation happen to y'all?\nPenguinJockey17: He\u2019s barely older than you. Unless he\u2019s a senior I don\u2019t see what\u2019s stopping you from asking him out, and the only reason I think it\u2019s different if he\u2019s a senior is because that would mean your relationship would immediately have one of you a long distance away. Are you in high school or college and has he shown any interest in you?\nVenUs\n\nText continuation:\n_buddy809: Yeah, we're in high school and I've noticed he's been looking at me a few times, but I don't know if it's just friendly or something more. I'm really nervous about approaching him because I don't want to come across as creepy or desperate.\nIt's funny, because when I'm around him, I feel like I can be myself, but at the same time, I'm terrified of ruining the dynamic we have. I don't want to make him uncomfortable or make him feel like he's being hit on.\nI've been thinking about trying to find common ground, like a shared interest or something, to break the ice. But at the same time, I don't want to overthink it and come across as too eager.\nHas anyone else ever been in a situation like this? How did you handle it?\nPenguinJockey17: I think you're overthinking it, to be honest. People are often more open to getting to know someone than we think they are. Just be yourself, be respectful, and see where it goes. If he's not interested, then that's okay. You'll learn from the experience and move on.\nThat being said, it's good that you're considering his feelings and not wanting to make him uncomfortable. That shows you're thinking about him as a person, not just as a potential partner.\nIf you do decide to talk to him, try to find a quiet spot where you can have a conversation without distractions. And don't be afraid to ask him questions about himself - people love talking about themselves, and it's a great way to build a connection.\nAlso, don't put too much pressure on the situation. Just enjoy the conversation and see where it takes you. And if it doesn't work out, then that's okay too. You'll learn to navigate these kinds of situations and become more confident in your ability to connect with others.\nAs for me, I've never been in a situation like this, but I have had to navigate awkward social situations before. And you know what? It's often the things that make us uncomfortable that can lead to the most rewarding experiences.\nSo, take a deep breath, be yourself, and see what happens.

The use of computational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single ventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of pacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the biomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing in clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In practice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each other's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD) the main steps involved in performing\n\nText continuation:\ncomputational simulations.\nThe first step is to define the problem and identify the specific clinical question being addressed. This requires a thorough understanding of the patient's anatomy and physiology, as well as the relevant clinical data. Next, the computational model is developed, which involves creating a digital representation of the patient's heart and blood vessels. This is typically done using specialized software and involves a range of techniques, including finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics.\nOnce the model is developed, it can be used to simulate various scenarios and predict the outcomes of different treatments. This allows clinicians to test different approaches and make informed decisions about the best course of action. The simulations can also be used to identify potential complications and develop strategies for mitigating them.\nIn addition to its clinical applications, computational simulation can also be used to advance our understanding of the underlying biology of congenital heart disease. For example, simulations can be used to study the effects of genetic mutations on heart development and function, or to investigate the role of environmental factors in the development of CHD.\nOverall, the use of computational simulation in the study of congenital heart disease has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach diagnosis and treatment. By providing a powerful tool for predicting outcomes and identifying potential complications, simulations can help clinicians make more informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Approved", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

Hillary Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday, but Clinton's narrow victory in Indiana will likely send the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on to the next round of primaries. Sen. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, greet supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina. As polls closed in Indiana, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Obama, but by the end of the evening, Clinton's lead had shrunk, dragging the race out until early Wednesday. A clear winner did not emerge until 1:15 a.m. Wednesday -- seven hours after the polls closed -- because results were slow to come in from Lake County, a Chicago suburb in northwestern Indiana with several precincts that went strongly for Obama. By Wednesday morning, all absentee ballots had been counted in Lake County and the final results showed Obama had taken the county by 12 percentage points. There were 115 delegates at stake in North Carolina and 72 in Indiana. Because Democratic delegates are awarded proportionally, Obama added four delegates to his lead, according to CNN estimates. Obama earlier claimed a decisive victory in North Carolina. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Obama held a 14-point lead over Clinton.  Watch analysis of NC, IN primaries \u00bb . \"Some were saying that North Carolina would be a game-changer in this election. But today, what North Carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in Washington,\" Obama told supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Watch Obama thank his supporters \u00bb . Obama took an overwhelming 91 percent of the black vote in North Carolina, according to exit polls, while Clinton claimed only 6 percent. Clinton took 59 percent of the white vote compared to 36 percent for Obama, according to the polls. Clinton told her supporters in Indianapolis, \"it's full-speed on to the White House.\"  Watch Clinton greet her supporters \u00bb . Clinton made a strong pitch to blue-collar workers in Indiana. She pulled a majority of the votes in rural and suburban Indiana during Tuesday's primary. In CNN exit polling, Clinton took 53 percent of the vote in suburban areas, compared with 47 percent for Obama of Illinois. She took 68 percent of the rural vote compared with Obama's 32 percent. In all, 1,738 voters were polled. Clinton had pitched herself as the candidate best-suited to turn around a flailing economy and consciously courted working-class voters in the state -- even driving a pickup truck up to a gas pump once to help promote her proposed temporary rollback of federal tax on gasoline. \"I believe that Americans need a champion in their corners,\" she said at a rally in Indianapolis. \"For too long we've had a president who has stood up and spoken out for the wealthy and the well-connected, but I don't think that's what Americans need. \"Standing up for working people is about the American dream and about the Democratic Party; standing up for the middle class is who we are and what we can be if we stick together.\" Eighty-nine percent of Indiana voters said they have been affected by what they called a recession. Clinton had a slight edge when voters were asked who is most likely to improve the economy -- taking 49 percent to Obama's 47 percent. The candidates now turn their attention to the upcoming contests in West Virginia, Kentucky and Oregon. According to early exit polls, half of Clinton's supporters in Indiana would not vote for Obama in a general election matchup with Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.  Watch what the exit polls show \u00bb . A third of Clinton voters said they would pick McCain over Obama, while 17 percent said they would not vote at all. Forty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would back Obama in November. Obama got even less support from Clinton backers in North Carolina, where 45 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for him over McCain. Thirty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for McCain while 12 percent said they would not vote. Obama voters appear to be more willing to support Clinton in November. In Indiana, 59 percent of Obama backers said they'd vote for Clinton, and 70 percent of Obama backers in North Carolina said vote for her against McCain. Obama on Tuesday said he didn't agree with those who said his party would not be able to unite. \"Tonight, many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided -- that Sen. Clinton's supporters will not support me, and that my supporters will not support her,\" he said. \"I'm here tonight to tell you that I don't believe it. Yes, there have been bruised feelings on both sides. Yes, each side desperately wants their candidate to win. But ultimately, this race is not about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain. \"This election is about you -- the American people -- and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future.\" Obama currently leads in pledged delegates and in states won, and he is ahead in the popular vote, if Florida and Michigan are not factored into the equation. Those states are being penalized for moving their primaries up in violation of party rules. With neither candidate expected to win the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination by June 3, the end of the primary season, the final decision will most likely fall to the 796 superdelegates: Democratic governors, members of Congress and party officials.  Watch how superdelegates could come into play \u00bb . Both candidates have spent the past two weeks shuttling between Indiana and North Carolina, each arguing to crucial working-class voters that their rival is out of touch when it comes to the pocketbook issues that are dominating the campaign.

Atomic and molecular line emissions from shocks may provide valuable information on the injection of mechanical energy in the interstellar medium (ISM), the generation of turbulence, and the processes of phase transition between the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) and the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM).Aims. In this series of papers, we investigate the properties of shocks propagating in the WNM. Our objective is to identify the tracers of these shocks, use them to interpret ancillary observations of the local diffuse matter, and provide predictions for future observations. Methods. Shocks propagating in the WNM are studied using the Paris-Durham shock code, a multi-fluid model built to follow the thermodynamical and chemical structures of shock waves, at steady-state, in a plane-parallel geometry\n\nText continuation:\n. The code, already designed to take into account the impact of an external radiation field, is updated to treat self-irradiated shocks at intermediate ($30<V_S <100$ km s$^{-1}$) and high velocity ($V_S \\ge 100$ km s$^{-1}$) which emit ultraviolet (UV), extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), and X-ray photons. The couplings between the photons generated by the shock, the radiative precursor, and the shock structure are computed self-consistently using an exact radiative transfer algorithm for line emission. The resulting code is explored over a wide range of parameters ($0.1 \\le n_H \\le 2$ cm$^{-3}$, $10 \\le V_S \\le 500$ km s$^{-1}$, and $0.1 \\le B \\le 10$ $\\mu$G) that covers the typical conditions of the WNM in the solar neighborhood. Results. The explored physical conditions are prompt to the existence of a diversity of stationary magnetohydrodynamic solutions, including J-type, CJ-type, and C-type shocks. These shocks are found to naturally induce phase transition between the WNM and the CNM, provided that the postshock thermal pressure is larger than the maximum pressure of the WNM and that the maximum density allowed by magnetic compression is larger than the minimum density of the CNM. The input flux of mechanical energy is primarily reprocessed into line emissions from the X-ray to the submillimeter domain. Intermediate and high velocity shocks are found to generate a UV radiation field that scales as $V_S^3$ for $V_S < 100$ km s$^{-1}$ and as $V_S^2$ at higher velocities, and an X-ray radiation field that scales as $V_S^3$ for $V_S \\ge 100$ km s$^{-1}$. Both radiation fields may extend over large distances in the preshock depending of the density of the surrounding medium and the hardness of the X-ray field which is solely driven by the shock velocity. Conclusions. This first paper presents the thermochemical trajectories of shocks in the WNM and their associated spectra. It corresponds to a new milestone in the development of the Paris-Durham shock code and a stepping stone for the analysis of observations that will be carried out in forthcoming works.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Can you provide a summary of who Harvey Marion LaFollette was?\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\nHarvey Marion LaFollette (September 8, 1858 \u2013 September 20, 1929) was an American teacher and educator, who as a young man, served two terms as Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. He then moved to Tennessee, where he established the town of LaFollette. His company, LaFollette Coal, Iron, and Railway Company, eventually employed more than 1500 people and was the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States.\n\nSummary:\nHarvey Marion LaFollette (September 8, 1858 \u2013 September 20, 1929) was an American teacher and educator, who as a young man, served two terms as Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. He then moved to Tennessee, where he established the town of LaFollette. His company, LaFollette Coal, Iron, and Railway Company, eventually employed more than 1500 people and was the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States.\nEarly life and education\nHarvey M. LaFollette was born in Primrose, Wisconsin. His first cousin, Robert Marion La Follette Sr., was three years old at the time and living on the adjoining farm. Harvey's father (also named Harvey M. LaFollette) was a farmer and served in local government both as sheriff and commissioner. When Harvey was two years old, his family relocated to join relatives in Thorntown, Indiana. Harvey's brother, William La Follette, was born shortly after they arrived in Indiana. When he was seven years old, his father was killed in an industrial accident while working on a piece of machinery in the flour mill he owned.\nYoung Harvey was always an avid reader, and after studying at the nearby Friends School and a short stint at Wabash College, he left for France, the land of his Huguenot ancestors, to continue his education. He studied in Paris at several institutions focusing on languages and civil engineering. He left Paris, travelling on foot and staying with peasant families to better understand the local dialects. He took additional courses in Germany and in Italy. He returned to Indiana in 1880 as a well-educated and travelled young man. He spoke five languages fluently.\nIndiana educator\nHe began teaching in the public schools as soon as he returned from abroad and became a school principal and a county superintendent before running for statewide office at the age of 28. He was elected to two terms as Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. In this job, he established a number of reforms as he standardized the textbooks and regularized the financial systems.\nLaFollette, Tennessee\nAlong with his youngest brother, Grant LaFollette, Harvey then moved some 400 miles (640 km) to the south and purchased more than 37,000 acres (150 km2) of land in the Tennessee mountains. He established and served as president and general manager of a company that eventually employed 1,500 people and became the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States. He built a railroad that allowed his product to be shipped. The town that grew up around his business venture was named LaFollette in his honor and became the county seat of Campbell County.\nPersonal life\nGlen Oaks\nHarvey built and lived in Glen Oaks, a 27\u2013room mansion in the center of LaFollette designed by Knoxville architect George Franklin Barber. The home on Indiana Avenue is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As his company grew, he traveled extensively and remained close to his extended family. During the glare of the Wisconsin governor's race of 1900, his mother and older brother and sister returned to Primrose with cousin Robert and other family members to visit the old log cabin where Harvey was born and to relive memories of the pioneering days of a half century earlier. During the next decade, Harvey and his wife were often in Washington, DC, visiting family members and meeting political allies. Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks was a friend from his younger days in Indiana. His brother and cousin both moved to the nation's capitol as members of Congress, and he visited them often. Later in his life, when the mines no longer produced and his business failed, he returned to his academic roots, corresponding with Abraham Lincoln scholar Louis A. Warren, who wrote The Lincoln and LaFollette Families in Pioneer Drama, a history of the Lincoln and LaFollette families on the Kentucky frontier in the years before Jesse LaFollette and Thomas Lincoln took their families across the Ohio River to settle in Indiana Territory.\nFamily\nHe was a member of the La Follette family. William La Follette was a younger brother. Robert M. La Follette Sr. was his first cousin. William Leroy LaFollette Jr. and Chester La Follette were nephews. Suzanne La Follette was a niece. Mimi LaFollette Summerskill was a grand niece. Her son was political leader Richard L. Wright. His only child, Warner Marion LaFollette, predeceased him. Harvey was visiting his brother, William, in Colfax, Washington when he died in 1929. Both he and William and other LaFollette family members are interred in the Colfax Cemetery in Whitman County, Washington.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Yes", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "La", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

This experience of liveness has been discussed for over two decades and a broad spectrum of research on this topic exists. Amongst others, this work has been carried out in the communities around three major ideas which incorporate liveness as an important aspect: live programming, exploratory programming, and live coding. While there have been publications on the focus of each particular community, the overall spectrum of liveness across these three communities has not been investigated yet. Thus, we want to delineate the variety of research on liveness. At the same time, we want to investigate overlaps and differences in the values and contributions between the\n\nText continuation:\nthree communities. Therefore, we conducted a literature study with a sample of 212 publications on the terms retrieved from three major indexing services. On this sample, we conducted a thematic analysis regarding the following aspects: motivation for liveness, application domains, intended outcomes of running a system, and types of contributions. We also gathered bibliographic information such as related keywords and prominent publications. Besides other characteristics the results show that the field of exploratory programming is mostly about technical designs and empirical studies on tools for general-purpose programming. In contrast, publications on live coding have the most variety in their motivations and methodologies with a majority being empirical studies with users. As expected, most publications on live coding are applied to performance art. Finally, research on live programming is mostly motivated by making programming more accessible and easier to understand, evaluating their tool designs through empirical studies with users. In delineating the spectrum of work on liveness, we hope to make the individual communities more aware of the work of the others. Further, by giving an overview of the values and methods of the individual communities, we hope to provide researchers new to the field of liveness with an initial overview.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

He now plays as a right-handed batter for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. He is widely recognised as one of the best batsman in cricket history. He is the second most prolific international century batsman in cricket history.

Kohli has also contributed to a number of India's victories, including the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions Trophy.\n\nSummary:\nVirat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation:  born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and former captain of the Indian national cricket team. He now plays as a right-handed batter for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. He is widely recognised as one of the best batsman in cricket history. He is the second most prolific international century batsman in cricket history. The International Cricket Council elected him the male cricketer of the decade despite holding the record for most runs in T20 internationals and the IPL. Kohli has also contributed to a number of India's victories, including the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions Trophy.\nKohli was born and raised in New Delhi, where he attended the West Delhi Cricket Academy and began his junior career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and soon established himself as a prominent member of the ODI team, eventually making his Test debut in 2011. For the first time, Kohli topped the ICC ODI batting rankings in 2013. During the 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a competition record for the most runs scored. In 2018, he became the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one place in all three versions of the game. \nIn 2019, he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade. Following the T20 World Cup in 2021, Kohli decided to step down as captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, and he stood down as captain of the Test team in early 2022.\nHe has garnered numerous awards for his achievements on the cricket pitch. He was named the ICC One-Day International Player of the Year in 2012 and has twice won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, which is awarded to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, in 2017 and 2018. Kohli was the best run scorer in the 2012 Asia Cup, scoring 357 runs. Kohli was also named ICC Test Player of the Year and ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2018, making him the first player to get both honours in the same year. In addition, from 2016 to 2018, he was crowned the Wisden Top Cricketer in the World for three years in a row. Kohli received the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in the sports category in 2017, and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna medal, India's highest sporting honour, in 2018.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Its design clearly separates explicit and symbolic directed exploration algorithms from the set of on-line and off-line computed estimates and associated data structures. MIPS has shown distinguished performance in the last two international planning competitions. In the last event the description language was extended from pure propositional planning to include numerical state variables, action durations, and plan quality objective functions. Plans were no longer sequences of actions but time-stamped schedules. As a participant of the fully automated track of the competition, MIPS has proven to be a general system; in each track\n\nText continuation:\nand every benchmark domain it efficiently computed plans of remarkable quality. This article introduces and analyzes the most important algorithmic novelties that were necessary to tackle the new layers of expressiveness in the benchmark problems and to achieve a high level of performance. The extensions include critical path analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal parallel plans. The linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses known NP hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect to the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations. The efficiency of this algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance: for each encountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is scheduled. One major strength of MIPS is its static analysis phase that grounds and simplifies parameterized predicates, functions and operators, that infers knowledge to minimize the state description length, and that detects domain object symmetries. The latter aspect is analyzed in detail. MIPS has been developed to serve as a complete and optimal state space planner, with admissible estimates, exploration engines and branching cuts. In the competition version, however, certain performance compromises had to be made, including floating point arithmetic, weighted heuristic search exploration according to an inadmissible estimate and parameterized optimization.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

never advised his clients on tax matters, his company Gestifute said in a statement.\nThe agent, who could be put under official investigation in the case, gave evidence at the hearing into alleged tax evasion by Monaco striker Radamel Falcao, one of his clients.\nFalcao, like Mendes, denies wrongdoing.\nThe former Chelsea and Manchester United striker is accused of failing to declare 5.3m euros (\u00a34.69m) of income earned from image rights between 2012 and 2013 while he played for Atletico Madrid.\nFalcao, 31, is alleged to have used a network of shell companies in the British Virgin Islands, Republic of Ireland, Colombia and Panama to avoid taxes on image rights income.\nThe Colombia international's case is being heard as the Spanish authorities place the tax affairs of footballers under increasing scrutiny, with a number of Mendes' clients being investigated, including Real Madrid team-mates Cristiano Ronaldo and Fabio Coentrao, who have also denied committing any offences.\nJudge Monica Gomez Ferrer, who is hearing the evidence relating to Falcao, is also overseeing the case of 32-year-old Portugal captain Ronaldo, and is scheduled to question him on 31 July over allegations he illegally evaded 14.7m euros (\u00a313m) in taxes.\nCoentrao, the 29-year-old Portugal international, is accused of having hidden close to 1.3m euros (\u00a31.15m) from the tax authorities.\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho, another client of 51-year-old Mendes, has been accused of failing to pay millions of euros in taxes during his time in charge of Real Madrid.\nHowever, Gestifute has said Mourinho, 54, had resolved the situation with the tax authorities.\nAngel di Maria, the 29-year-old Paris St-Germain winger who is represented by Mendes, agreed to pay 2m euros (\u00a31.76m) to settle a tax case last week.\nEarlier this month, Gestifute made a statement denying that Mendes has done anything wrong.\nIt read: \"Neither Jorge Mendes nor the company he manages, Gestifute, participate in or offer any service linked, directly or indirectly, to financial, fiscal or legal advice to their clients.\"\n\nSummary:\nFootball agent Jorge Mendes has denied

in a scheme backed by Ifad and Cafedirect - the farmers' fortunes have been transformed.\nBy coming together in co-operatives and by processing their cocoa, they have managed to get a much better return on their crop.\n\"Before Cafedirect I would work from day-to-day, hand-to-mouth,\" says Mr Esperansa.\n\"I did not think about the future.\"\nCafedirect head Anne MacCaig recently travelled to the islands to see how it was done.\n\"They have the facilities to ferment the product and then from that they are able to work together across the different organisations to dry the cocoa, collect it all in one central warehouse,\" she said.\n\"Then they are able to export it.\n\"They are benefiting from five times the price they had when they sold it as a gloopy white liquid.\"\nBefore the programme began in 2004, Sao Tome produced just 50 tonnes of cocoa.\nBy mid-2010 this had risen to 600 tonnes of organic, Fairtrade beans.\nMany producers have invested in home improvements and can now afford items like bicycles, generators, radios and refrigerators.\nThe co-operatives are investing in primary health-care clinics and better sanitation.\nBut is the support for the cocoa crop tying the farmers into a single crop, monoculture?\nMrs MacCaig says it will not.\n\"Sao Tome is an island with incredibly rich volcanic soil, so if you can do this with cocoa, there are so many other products that can be grown as well.\"\n\nSummary:\nFarmers on the islands of Sao Tome and Principe, off the coast of West Africa, are again enjoying the sweet taste of success thanks to high-quality, organic, Fairtrade cocoa - the raw ingredient for chocolate.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

And just like her chart career, her marriage to Carl Dean turned 50 this year.\n\"I thought, well, this would be a good year to write an album of love songs,\" she says. \"I've never done that before. I've usually had a story song or a gospel song, but this was all love stories.\"\nThe BBC caught up with the star to discuss the new record, her legendary Glastonbury set, and why she admires Adele.\nFirst of all, congratulations on celebrating your golden wedding anniversary!\nThank you so much. That's a long time to do anything, ain't it? Especially to be married.\nWhat's the secret?\nWe've always been good buddies. We have a lot of fun and a lot of respect for one another. It was his first marriage and mine and we never thought we'd ever want to do that again. Why bother?\nYou renewed your vows earlier this year. What was that like?\nThat was sweet. There was no pressure at all. We had our own little ceremony in a little chapel on our property, then we went in our little RV down to Ringgold, Georgia, and spent the night where we had married 50 years before. We took some beautiful pictures and got all dressed up. It was fun really.\nDid you wear your original wedding dress? Could you still fit into it?\nWell, I could but I don't know where it is now! I only had a simple little white dress that my mother had made for me for that wedding, but I had always wanted a beautiful, long, beaded wedding gown, so I dressed completely to the nines. I made a right nice bride!\nThat sense of romance permeates your new album.\nOh yes! In fact a lot of the songs were written just because of that.\nYou've written so many love songs over the years - how do you find new ways to talk about it?\nLove is always growing, and we grow as people as well, so you just automatically take on new twists and turns. And it's amazing. I've always been amazed by that myself, how people can just write, year in and year out, about love and it all is different. I could write one right now!\nHow often do you write?\nI write something almost every single day unless I'm sick or on a movie set.\nIs that ever an inconvenience? Do you ever find yourself going, \"I don't have time to write a song right now, I need to finish this casserole?\"\nWell, no! In fact, I write a lot when I cook. If my cooking's really good that day, my songs are really good.\nIn Head Over High Heels, you sing about \"painting my eyes like Adele.\" What made you write about her?\nEveryone loves Adele. With all my little nieces, it's all \"Adele this\" and \"Adele that!\" And I love how she does her make-up, and so I'm always saying to my little nieces, \"can you fix my eyes like Adele?\"\nWhen I started that song, I had not planned to write that line. I was just thinking, \"This needs to be about a girl dressing up sexy, so she's got to have some make-up, and she's got to paint her eyes\". And all of a sudden it's like, \"And my eyes like Adele!\"\nWhat do you think her reaction will be?\nI think she'll have to be complimented, just like I'm always complimented when people write songs about me!\nI just meant I wanted to look like Adele. I hope she thinks it's cute.\nYou both like to talk to your audience in between songs, but she swears a lot more than you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I wondered what you made of that?\nOh, I don't pay any attention to that! Words are just an exchange, like money. I don't think the Lord holds that against us. I think that's just the way we communicate. And some people are just born cussers.\nWhat's the worst thing you've ever said on stage?\nOh, I've never said anything real bad. I try to respect the audience.\nThe song I'm 16 is based on one of your sisters, is that right?\nYeah, she had a couple of bad relationships and she thought it wasn't meant for her to have true love. Then all of a sudden, in her 60s, she met someone and they fell in love, and it's just like they were born again. It's just the sweetest thing.\nAnother one of my sisters and I were laughing. We said, \"Look at her, she thinks she's 16!\" and all of a sudden I heard the song in my head.\nGoes to show you're never old unless you choose to be.\nWhat age do you think of yourself as?\nI'm 16 in some ways. I'm still a hopeless romantic! But I'm 35 in my spirit and in my mind. When I was 35, it was a pinnacle, a great time in my life - success and happiness and all that. And so I just decided \"I'm gonna claim that number and always be that in my state of mind.\"\nWhat inspired Can't Be That Wrong?\nThat was an easy one to write. I think it's the ultimate cheating song.\nI based it on someone very, very close to me, who was very much in love with the person at home, and their children, and they weren't looking for love, they just happened to fall for someone. They were so torn, because they loved both people. I saw the turmoil and the heartache, and how overwhelming and overpowering it was. And I just thought, \"That's a strong-ass love, right there\". You know, to be willing to go through all you have to, and put the other people through that. So I thought, \"wow, this would make a great song.\"\nThe last time I saw you on stage in the UK was at Glastonbury - and you've put that concert on this album as a bonus disc. What are your memories of it?\nThat'll be one of my greatest memories, actually. That'll be a real highlight in my career.\nI wasn't even certain about doing that show, because I didn't know if I was the type of artist that would fit in that type of a festival - because people are rowdy, they like to go dancing, and they like to drink and smoke and I thought, \"I wonder if they're even going to pay attention?\"\nAnd so, as soon as I went out and I saw the crowd and heard the roar, I thought, \"Ohhhh, my Lord, how did I miss this all these years?\"\nThey call that part of the day the \"legends slot\". If you were booking next year's Glastonbury, who would you put in there?\nI don't know. I hadn't even thought about it in those terms. Probably Adele.\nBut I'm not sure I'd do it again, because I don't know how I could ever top that.\nPure and Simple is out now on RCA Records.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.\n\nSummary:\nIt is 50 years since Dolly Parton first entered the US charts, with a cover of The Tune Weavers' Happy, Happy Birthday Baby.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries. Half of the summaries contain people's names and half don't, but I don't know which is which. The instructions to the summary writer were: \"Without quoting directly from the text give me a summary of the different types of motorcycles.\". I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\nThe six main types of motorcycles are generally recognized as standard, cruiser, touring, sports, off-road, and dual-purpose. Sport touring is sometimes recognized as a seventh category or integrated with the touring category.\nAlthough there are many names and systems for classifying types of motorcycles based on their characteristics and usage, there are generally six categories recognized by most motorcycle manufacturers and organizations.\nStrong distinctions are usually made between the six main types of motorcycles and other motorcycles. Scooter, moped, underbone, miniature, pocket, electric, and three-wheeled motorcycles are generally excluded from the main categories but other classification schemes may include these as types of motorcycles.\nThere is no universal system for classifying all types of motorcycles. There are strict classification systems enforced by competitive motorcycle sport sanctioning bodies, or legal definitions of a motorcycle established by certain legal jurisdictions for motorcycle registration, emissions, road traffic safety rules or motorcyclist licensing. There are also informal classifications or nicknames used by manufacturers, riders, and the motorcycling media. Some experts do not recognize sub-types, like naked bike, that \"purport to be classified\" outside the six usual classes, because they fit within one of the main types and are recognizable only by cosmetic changes.\nStreet motorcycles are motorcycles designed for being ridden on paved roads. They have smooth tires with tread patterns and engines generally in the 125 cc (7.6 cu in) and over range. Typically, street motorcycles are capable of speeds up to 100 mph (160 km/h), and many of speeds in excess of 125 mph (201 km/h). Street motorcycles powered by electric motors are becoming more common, with firms like Harley-Davidson entering the market.\n\nSummary:\nMotorcycles are 2 wheeled vehicles powered by an internal combustion engine generally made for a single rider.  Although there are many styles of motorcycles, they are loosely organized into 6 main categories.  These categories most closely align to the intended use of the vehicle.  There is your standard motorcycle, your more relaxed cruising motorcycle, the larger capacity and longer haul touring cycle, a racing more sportier sports cycle and then you have a off-road motorcycle often known as a dirtbike and lastly a dual-sport which is a motorcycle that can go both on and offroad.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\nGood Friday is a Christian holiday commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus and his death at Calvary. It is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum. It is also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Great and Holy Friday (also Holy and Great Friday), and Black Friday.\nMembers of many Christian denominations, including the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist, Oriental Orthodox, United Protestant and some Reformed traditions (including certain Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches), observe Good Friday with fasting and church services. In many Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican and Methodist churches, the Service of the Great Three Hours' Agony is held from noon until 3 pm, the time duration that the Bible records as darkness covering the land to Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross. Communicants of the Moravian Church have a Good Friday tradition of cleaning gravestones in Moravian cemeteries.\nThe date of Good Friday varies from one year to the next in both the Gregorian and Julian calendars. Eastern and Western Christianity disagree over the computation of the date of Easter and therefore of Good Friday. Good Friday is a widely instituted legal holiday around the world, including in most Western countries and 12 U.S. states. Some predominantly Christian countries, such as Germany, have laws prohibiting certain acts such as dancing and horse racing, in remembrance of the somber nature of Good Friday.\n\nSummary:\nGood Friday is a Christian holiday to remember the crucifixion of Jesus. Members of a lot of christian denominations observe this holiday with fasting and church services. The date of the holiday varies from year to year depending on the computation of the date of Easter.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Good", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I\u2019m 25 years old and live with the most amazing woman ever. I\u2019m about to ask her to be my wife. We love to camp,fish,hike and just be outdoors in general. We also love to party and drink because we are young and like to have some fun. We don\u2019t go out much at all..We just aren\u2019t very social people and like to keep a relatively small circle. The few friends that I have I\u2019ve known since high school. One now does hardcore drugs so I don\u2019t talk to him unless he comes to me anymore. My other friend, my \u201cbest friend\u201d is an alcoholic. He tends to be okay until he\u2019s drank too much and it happens most times we hangout.  Once he is past that point he annoys the heck out of me\n\nText continuation:\nand my girlfriend and I just regret inviting him over. He never invites me anywhere or puts any effort into making plans and never has. It\u2019s always me making the plans.\u2026.we have new acquaintances tell us they want to hangout all the time but it never ends up happening\u2026we just continue on with our lives like the conversation never happened. It comes to a point where I feel awkward because I\u2019ve asked someone to hangout three times and it has fell through every time\u2026is it me? Am I bipolar? Do I judge my \u201cfriends\u201d too much? I\u2019ve never not had any friends but right now I just don\u2019t know if my friendships are healthy and genuine. I\u2019d love some positive help if anyone has any. Thanks in advance.\nFL-Irish: Re: the old friends, the whole hard drugs/alcoholic scene are pretty toxic in general, and extremely bad for young families, so if they're heading in that direction you need to REALLY limit how often you see these friends. (as you have with the one who's on drugs) Maybe be there for them in a pinch, but it doesn't even sound like you're enjoying hanging out with the alcoholic one. I don't think you're judging them as human beings. I think you're just protecting your normal life from stuff that has the potential to drag you down. \nSo moving on, it's hard to assess your situation. You say a few things have fallen through -- that's pretty common in the adult world, honestly, where everyone is busy with life. So, to go from that to a possible idea of being \"bipolar?\" That's quite the jump! Do you have any reason to suspect mental health issues? If so, it might be worth making a one-off appointment with a counselor just to discuss that. Anyway, hard to judge from what you've said. \nSo I'd continue to reach out to the acquaintances. Something like, \"Hey, the wife and I are considering doing X this weekend. Any chance you guys would like to join us?\"\nIf the answer is they can't, then just say, \"No problem, maybe some other time!\" Keep the energy and enthusiasm level high. You don't want to be giving off negative or disappointed vibes. Check in by text at least once a week.\nAt the same, don't invest all your eggs in this one social basket. If there are other couples who have potential, make it a habit to reach out and mention potential things you could do together. A picnic. A show. A barbecue. Go out for dinner. A movie. A farmers market. Go to the gym or the dog park. Hit a garage sale. \nIt's easier to make friends when you've got more than one thing going on, and you can issue casual invitations that don't seem high pressure. \"Oh, we're doing this if you're interested. Let us know!\"\nDon't get discouraged. I think you're on the right track. Good luck!\nHighlightSame7499: Thank you soooo much for this. I really needed it. It definitely helped me relieve some anxiety/stress with my situation and was very enjoyable to read. I\u2019m going to keep trying because I do want quality friends in my life.

It is known for its diverse wildlife which includes orangutans and Sumatran tigers.\nA government moratorium on deforestation was signed in 2011 and was intended to slow down the pace of deforestation.\nBut environmental activists say corrupt politicians are quick to sell off huge swathes of rainforests for profit, and they point to the need for more monitoring and sanctions to stop the rate at which Indonesia is losing its forests, says the BBC's Karishma Vaswani.\nMassive forest fires in Indonesia to clear land last year caused a heavy smog to blanket neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore, triggering health concerns in those countries.\nNorway has pledged a billion dollars to Indonesia if it can prove it is serious about stopping deforestation.\nAgencies report that Norway has paid almost $50 million to Indonesia to help set up new institutions to reduce deforestation.\nBut Indonesia will only start to get large amounts of money if deforestation is slowed down.\n\nSummary:\nA new study has shown that Indonesia lost about 60,000 sq km of virgin forest - an area close to the size of Ireland - over a period of 12 years.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Approved", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

When the population totals of some auxiliary variables are known and when the inclusion probabilities are known by design, survey statisticians have developed calibration methods for improving efficiencies of the inverse probability weighting estimators and the methods can be applied to missing data analysis. Model-based calibration has been proposed in the survey sampling literature, where multidimensional auxiliary variables are first summarized into a predictor function from a working regression model. Usually, one working model is being proposed for each parameter of interest and results in different sets of calibration weights for\n\nText continuation:\neach parameter.\nThese calibration weights can be used to adjust the estimated means and totals of the auxiliary variables to match the known population totals, thereby improving the accuracy of the estimates. The calibration process can also be used to account for complex survey designs, such as stratification and clustering, by incorporating these design effects into the working model. Furthermore, the calibration weights can be used to adjust for non-response bias by weighting the complete cases by the inverse of the non-response probability.\nIn addition to the model-based calibration, other calibration methods have also been proposed, such as propensity score calibration and density ratio calibration. These methods are based on different assumptions and can be used in different contexts, such as when the inclusion probabilities are unknown or when the auxiliary variables are not available. The choice of calibration method depends on the specific survey design and the nature of the missing data.\nThe calibration methods can be applied to various types of survey data, including cross-sectional and longitudinal data, and can be used to estimate a wide range of parameters, such as population means, totals, and proportions. The methods can also be used to adjust for non-response bias in complex surveys, such as those with multiple stages of selection and non-response. Overall, the calibration methods provide a powerful tool for improving the accuracy and efficiency of survey estimates, and can be used in a variety of applications, including health surveys, economic surveys, and social surveys.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "A"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

Shame on those judgemental bums\nlightknight7777: I think it's important to understand that these people grew up being fed these answers by the government. It's easy to get mad at them,  but they're victims too. I can't imagine not being able to appreciate women and yet their society saw fit to rob them of that through ignorance and misdirection. Women absolutely have it worse, but direct your anger at the government and programs that made them this way, first and foremost.\nSakuraba85: Would you say the same thing about Hitler?\nlightknight7777: Hitler formed the society that overthrew\n\nText continuation:\nthe previous system and installed his insane beliefs. I would say the children in Hitler youth were first generation victims. \nYou don't get to be a victim of the system when you installed it.\nWhat's more is a bully who was made a bully by the system is still a bully.  You can be a victim and also an asshole. You can be mad at Hitler and the environment that raised him. But Hitler had access to different viewpoints and picked the one he arrived at despite education. These kids don't have that luxury. When someone disagrees,  men with sticks show up and beat the hell out of them.\nSakuraba85: What do you mean? Hitler was shaped by his education and upbringing just like these men. \nHe grew up with being ashamed of how Germany acted and was treated after WW1 and was taught about that in school and his society.\nlightknight7777: The reason Hitler was evil wasn't him being mad at how Germany was treated.  It wasn't even him wanting to make Germany powerful again.  Conquerers have existed all throughout history without being known from then on as evil.  It was the \"genocide\" bit that made him the image of evil. Out of a plethora of perfectly viable options, he decided on concentration camps and murder. \nThere's a massive difference between being raised to think something bad is \"the truth\" vs specifically seeking out something bad to believe in from options. He arrived at his particular brand of insanity after significant research and adult social circles. You can be mad at him even having that path to come to. Heck, antisemitism was super common at the time (even in the US), but him going \"therefore let's remove them\" was  on him. Every other government was managing to not round them up and murder them.\nSakuraba85: Ok, i understand. It\u2019s not evil wanting to hang children because they don\u2019t want to have fabric on their heads. Got it. It\u2019s not their fault.\nlightknight7777: As I stated,  a bully who was made a bully by their system is still a bully. Them espousing the evil beliefs they were taught is still bad but they are also victims as well. \nWhat you don't seem to be accepting is my primary point that the system that produces evil is more evil than the individuals. At no point did I say they weren't espousing evil.

He answered that he understands, and that was it. UNTIL. \nAnyway, prior to this I was inviting him to join the others in group activites etc because it seemed he was always left out, maybe because he is the only guy or maybe because he's not speaking the language very well. I guess he took it as a hint of me being interested. I nevertheless very explicitly (over text) turned his date invitation down, giving my two reasons. \nToday he was about to be left out once again in a group assignment and was kinda\n\nText continuation:\njust looking lost so I invited him to join our group. After this followed some pretty heavy flirting on his part. I avoided eye contact with him, turned my attention to the other group members instead, answered him only shortly etc. He continued flirting after class, asking to \"see my necklace\". I told him \"no, I don't feel comfortable with that because you'd be getting really close to me\". He apologised if what he said made me feel uncomfortable, I just told him we're good now but I just don't want that stuff.\nI know how to set my boundaries but I'm a bit unsure how to assert my stance to him permanently. Should I not include him next time he seems lost? Is my friendliness doomed to be an invitation in his eyes? No one else in our course does anything to include him and I feel so bad about that. It's very unnatural to me to not include people like that but I guess I have to dismiss him more since he seems to interpret me wrong every time, right? I have told him very clearly that I am just being generally friendly and he is there everyday when I treat everybody with the same niceness as him. Should I say something more to him about this? \nI am going to meet him like multiple times a week for the next 4 years in our tiny ass class so I can't do anything crazy. I'm so stressed out about this. \nTL;DR a classic story: I was friendly to a loner guy in my class, he asked me out, I turned him down, he continues flirting. Should I be colder towards him because being a friendly seems to encourage him?\nnopiepoopi: I just wanted to say I think it could be worth bringing up with your other friends/classmates how they don\u2019t include him. \nJust discuss with them and ask them why they don\u2019t include him. Is there any reason? Are they genuinely just overlooking him? If so, maybe they can help you with including him too. I don\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t unless they\u2019re purposefully excluding him, and if that\u2019s the case, there should be a good reason as to why they\u2019re excluding him. \nIt would be nice for everyone to put in efforts to include others, is all.\nsplashysoup: That sounds good.

So when things go wrong I fully understand the dissatisfaction of passengers and the inconvenience that is caused.\n\"Although there are no guarantees major failures won't happen, I give my reassurance that ScotRail has learned lessons and is far better prepared for contingencies, including communication with passengers, when such incidents do take place.\"\nHe added: \"I know about the work that is required and the service that is to be delivered. I am taking action and a plan is now in place. This government has a track record of delivering for our railways and it is my firm intention that we will continue to do so.\"\nIn his statement, Mr Yousaf also highlighted:\nScotRail was ordered to produce a performance improvement plan in September after punctuality and reliability fell below the expected standard.\nAt Holyrood, the minister faced calls to publish the plan in full from Liberal Democrat Mike Rumbles.\nMr Yousaf agreed to speak to ScotRail about its publication in the interests of \"accountability and transparency\".\nScottish Labour's transport spokesman Neil Bibby said the rail service has become worse since the improvement plan was demanded.\nHe added: \"His handling of the rail crisis has seen him fall out with Abellio, Network Rail and the transport unions.\n\"Humza Yousaf claims he's not a transport expert - and he's right. Humza Yousaf must ditch the spin and publish his 246 point improvement plan in full.\"\nMurdo Fraser, of the Scottish Conservatives, said it was time the government started taking responsibility for the railways' poor performance.\nThe latest performance data showed 86% of ScotRail trains were on time or less than five minutes late between 16 October and 12 November, with wide variations in reliability across the country.\nScotRail's figures remained better than the average for all UK train operators - with the company also enjoying better than average customer satisfaction figures when the latest data was published earlier this year.\nBut Abellio's contract to run the ScotRail franchise requires the company to ensure 91.3% of trains arrive within five minutes of schedule.\nThe Scottish government can cancel the contract if performance drops to 84.3% for three months in a row.\n\nSummary:\nScottish Transport Minister Humza Yousaf apologized for rail disruptions, citing overhead wiring problems, and outlined plans to improve services, including adding carriages and earlier commuter trains.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "\"", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

A PSPO was used to stop people taking legal highs around Taunton.\nIf people flout the new rules and refuse to engage with the council or drug charities, they could be fined or prosecuted.\nCouncillors at Wednesday's cabinet meeting also agreed an awareness campaign to raise better understanding of the support available for rough sleepers.\nMartin, who begs on the streets, told the BBC: \"I want to get myself clean but there's no help.\n\"I need help now, not in a few months down the line. At the end of the day they should sit here, then they would understand.\n\"I'm not abusive, I'm polite, I'm only sat here, I'm not going out shoplifting or going and mugging people.\"\nBut Ms Dallimore said support is available for those who want to tackle their addictions.\nShe said: \"We have been working with not only the police but also with a lot of our charitable sector partners including Turning Point who help people with substance misuse issues.\n\"It's welcome news this individual wants help, and the public needs to report individuals they're coming across to us.\"\n\nSummary:\nGloucester City Council has introduced Public Space Protection Orders to ban begging and public nuisance in the city centre, with fines and prosecution for those who refuse to engage with support services.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The instructions given to the continuation writer were: \"Your task is to write a natural continuation of the following text.\". I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nHomozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) are associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 11 (CLN11), a rare lysosomal-storage disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, seizures, retinitis pigmentosa, and cognitive disorders, usually beginning between 13 and 25 years of age. This is a rare condition, previously reported in only four families. In contrast, heterozygous GRN mutations are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia associated with neuronal cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. We identified homozygous GRN mutations in six new patients. The phenotypic spectrum is much broader than previously reported, with two remarkably distinct presentations, depending on the age of onset. A childhood/juvenile form is characterized by classical CLN11 symptoms at an early age at onset. Unexpectedly\n\nText continuation:\n, other homozygous patients presented a distinct delayed phenotype of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism after 50 years; none had epilepsy or cerebellar ataxia. Another major finding of this study is that all GRN mutations may not have the same impact on progranulin protein synthesis. A hypomorphic effect of some mutations is supported by the presence of residual levels of plasma progranulin and low levels of normal transcript detected in one case with a homozygous splice-site mutation and late onset frontotemporal dementia. This is a new critical finding that must be considered in therapeutic trials based on replacement strategies. The first neuropathological study in a homozygous carrier provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of the disease. Hallmarks of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were present. The absence of TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions markedly differs from observations of heterozygous mutations, suggesting a pathological shift between lysosomal and TDP-43 pathologies depending on the mono or bi-allelic status. An intriguing observation was the loss of normal TDP-43 staining in the nucleus of some neurons, which could be the first stage of the TDP-43 pathological process preceding the formation of typical cytoplasmic inclusions. Finally, this study has important implications for genetic counselling and molecular diagnosis. Semi-dominant inheritance of GRN mutations implies that specific genetic counseling should be delivered to children and parents of CLN11 patients, as they are heterozygous carriers with a high risk of developing dementia. More broadly, this study illustrates the fact that genetic variants can lead to different phenotypes according to their mono- or bi-allelic state, which is a challenge for genetic diagnosis.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

It said the Australian government welcomed independent scrutiny of its facilities.\nAustralia transports asylum seekers who arrive by boat to off-shore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea.\nRead more: Why are asylum seekers so controversial in Australia?\nThe Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report was written after an incognito visit to Nauru last month. The organisations said Australia's actions seemed designed to discourage other migrants from attempting to get to Australia.\nNo documentary evidence was provided in the report to support the claim.\nBut interviews with 84 refugees and asylum seekers unearthed claims of rape and assault at the hand of Nauruan locals, inadequate medical care and cramped, uncomfortable living conditions.\nThe detention centre at Nauru is run by a company called Broadspectrum and medical services are provided by International Health and Medical Services. Both companies have a contract with the Australian government.\nOne woman quoted in the report said she had married a man 15 years her senior in order to feel safe on the island. Another said Nauruan men had driven her into the jungle with the intent of raping her.\nAlthough most held on the island have been identified as genuine refugees and released into the community, many felt afraid to leave their accommodations, particularly at night, the report said.\nThe report also alleged that Nauruan police tended to downplay or ignore asylum seekers' reports of abuse.\n\nSummary:\nAustralia's government has \"strongly\" refuted claims it deliberately ignores abuse of asylum seekers.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\nTable tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a racket sport derived from tennis but distinguished by its playing surface being atop a stationary table, rather than the court on which players stand. Either individually or in teams of two, players take alternating turns returning a light, hollow ball over the table's net onto the opposing half of the court using small rackets until they fail to do so, which results in a point for the opponent. Play is fast, requiring quick reaction and constant attention, and is characterized by an emphasis on spin relative to other ball sports, which can heavily affect the ball's trajectory.\nOwed to its small minimum playing area, its ability to be played indoors in all climates, and relative accessibility of equipment, table tennis is enjoyed worldwide not just as a competitive sport, but as a common recreational pastime among players of all levels and ages.\n\nSummary:\nTable tennis is a sport that plays a ball on a table with rackets. Its rule has evolved over the years, like the material of the racket and balls, size of the balls. Like tennis, it can also play simple or double games. It is popular because it doesn't require a big area, and normally people can play it even at an older age.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Good", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

They said he attacked people on the sidewalk and was running in front of cars, Mr Ozanne said.\nMr Kenny drew his firearm before entering the apartment building Robinson was in and he claims he was attacked by Robinson at the top of the stairs.\nHe said he feared he would be knocked down the stairs and Robinson would take his gun, and he fired seven shots at him.\nBut Mr Robinson's relatives, and many of the Wisconsin protesters, insist he is a victim of police brutality.\n\"My decision won't bring him back, it will not end the racial disparities that exist in justice system,\" said Mr Ozanne.\n\"It is not based on emotion, rather the facts as they have been investigated and reported to me, guided by the rule of law.\"\n\nSummary:\nNo charges will be brought against a white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed teenager in Wisconsin.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "I", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some text starts and continuations.

I'm going to show you the start of a text and then the continuation, and I want you to tell me whether the continuation contains any person names.\n\nText start:\nCANVAS caused by RFC1 biallelic expansions is a major cause of inherited sensory neuronopathy. Detection of RFC1 expansion is challenging and CANVAS can be associated with atypical features. We clinically and genetically characterized 50 patients, selected based on the presence of sensory neuronopathy confirmed by EMG. We screened RFC1 expansion by PCR, repeat-primed PCR, and Southern blotting of long-range PCR products, a newly developed method. Neuropathological characterization was performed on the brain and spinal cord of one patient. Most patients (88%) carried a biallelic (AAGGG)n expansion in RFC1. In addition to the core CANVAS phenotype (sensory neuronopathy, cerebellar syndrome, and vestibular impairment), we observed chronic cough (97%), oculomotor signs (85%), motor neuron involvement\n\nText continuation:\n(55%), dysautonomia (50%), and parkinsonism (10%). Motor neuron involvement was found for 24 of 38 patients (63.1%). First motor neuron signs, such as brisk reflexes, extensor plantar responses, and/or spasticity, were present in 29% of patients, second motor neuron signs, such as fasciculations, wasting, weakness, or a neurogenic pattern on EMG in 18%, and both in 16%. Mixed motor and sensory neuronopathy was observed in 19% of patients. Among six non-RFC1 patients, one carried a heterozygous AAGGG expansion and a pathogenic variant in GRM1. Neuropathological examination of one RFC1 patient with an enriched phenotype, including parkinsonism, dysautonomia, and cognitive decline, showed posterior column and lumbar posterior root atrophy. Degeneration of the vestibulospinal and spinocerebellar tracts was mild. We observed marked astrocytic gliosis and axonal swelling of the synapse between first and second motor neurons in the anterior horn at the lumbar level. The cerebellum showed mild depletion of Purkinje cells, with empty baskets, torpedoes, and astrogliosis characterized by a disorganization of the Bergmann's radial glia. We found neuronal loss in the vagal nucleus. The pars compacta of the substantia nigra was depleted, with widespread Lewy bodies in the locus coeruleus, substantia nigra, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. We propose new guidelines for the screening of RFC1 expansion, considering different expansion motifs. Here, we developed a new method to more easily detect pathogenic RFC1 expansions. We report frequent motor neuron involvement and different neuronopathy subtypes. Parkinsonism was more prevalent in this cohort than in the general population, 10% versus the expected 1% (p < .001). We describe, for the first time, the spinal cord pathology in CANVAS, showing the alteration of posterior columns and roots, astrocytic gliosis and axonal swelling, suggesting motor neuron synaptic dysfunction.\n\nDoes the continuation contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "S", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "assistant", "answer_neg": "The"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

The modern Romanian state was formed in 1859 through a personal union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877. During World War I, after declaring its neutrality in 1914, Romania fought together with the Allied Powers from 1916. In the aftermath of the war, Bukovina, Bessarabia, Transylvania, and parts of Banat, Cri\u0219ana, and Maramure\u0219 became part of the Kingdom of Romania. In June\u2013August 1940, as a consequence of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact and Second Vienna Award, Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union and Northern Transylvania to Hungary. In November 1940, Romania signed the Tripartite Pact and, consequently, in June 1941 entered World War II on the Axis side, fighting against the Soviet Union until August 1944, when it joined the Allies and recovered Northern Transylvania. Following the war and occupation by the Red Army, Romania became a socialist republic and a member of the Warsaw Pact. After the 1989 Revolution, Romania began a transition towards democracy and a market economy.\n\nSummary:\nRomania's history began with settlement in the Lower Paleolithic era, followed by the kingdom of Dacia and subsequent Romanization by the Roman Empire. The modern Romanian state was formed in 1859 through a personal union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, gaining independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877.\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) No\nB) Yes\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "A", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "Appro", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "A"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "A", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "I"}}}, {"sentence": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have some news articles and accompanying summaries.

I'm going to show you a news article and a summary, and I want you to tell me whether it contains any person names.\n\nArticle:\nPetrified wood, also known as petrified tree (from Ancient Greek \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 meaning 'rock' or 'stone'; literally 'wood turned into stone'), is the name given to a special type of fossilized wood, the fossilized remains of terrestrial vegetation. Petrifaction is the result of a tree or tree-like plants having been replaced by stone via a mineralization process that often includes permineralization and replacement. The organic materials making up cell walls have been replicated with minerals (mostly silica in the form of opal, chalcedony, or quartz). In some instances, the original structure of the stem tissue may be partially retained. Unlike other plant fossils, which are typically impressions or compressions, petrified wood is a three-dimensional representation of the original organic material.\nThe petrifaction process occurs underground, when wood becomes buried in water or volcanic ash. The presence of water reduces the availability of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition by bacteria and fungi. Mineral-laden water flowing through the sediments may lead to permineralization, which occurs when minerals precipitate out of solution filling the interiors of cells and other empty spaces. During replacement, the plant's cell walls act as a template for mineralization. There needs to be a balance between the decay of cellulose and lignin and mineral templating for cellular detail to be preserved with fidelity. Most of the organic matter often decomposes, however some of the lignin may remain. Silica in the form of opal-A, can encrust and permeate wood relatively quickly in hot spring environments. However, petrified wood is most commonly associated with trees that were buried in fine grained sediments of deltas and floodplains or volcanic lahars and ash beds. A forest where such material has petrified becomes known as a petrified forest.\n\nSummary:\nPetrified wood is one of fossils, it is a plant which the inner part has been replaced by stone by compressions and impressions through millions of years\n\nDoes this summary contain any person names?\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nRespond only with the letter A or B.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n", "answer_neut": "B", "steered": {"layer16_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer16_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "Good", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer13,14,15,16,17,18_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult3": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult4": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult5": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult6": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "B", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult10": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}, "layer0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31_mult14": {"answer_zeroedout": "B", "answer_pos": "A", "answer_neg": "B"}}}]
