Paatelainen was a popular playing figure in the distinctive green of Hibernian. The Finn, who enjoyed two playing spells with the Scottish Premier League club, joins from Finnish side TPS Turku. The 40-year-old, who also played for Dundee United, Aberdeen, St Johnstone and St Mirren in Scotland -- as well as Bolton and Wolverhampton in England, confirmed he is relishing the challenge of his new job. \"I am very happy to take up this opportunity,\" Paatelainen said. \"Everyone knows of my great affection for this club and I believe my desire to see teams play exciting, attacking and intelligent football fits well with the club's philosophy. \"I will bring energy, hard-work and leadership to the squad. I am also committed to working with players, as individuals and groups, to help them to improve. \"If I can help one player improve, the team is better. If I can help all players improve, we are much better.\" Capped 70 times by Finland, Paatelainen helped Turku finish third in the Veikkausliiga last year. Compensation for his release has been agreed. His two playing stints with Hibernian were from 1998-2001 and 2002-2003, either side of a spell with French side Strasbourg. Paatelainen may know some of the Hibernian players who have come through the youth set-up, having been involved in coaching of the club's youngsters during his second playing spell. Hibernian chairman Rod Petrie said: \"We are delighted Mixu has agreed to take up the challenge and opportunity of managing Hibernian. We are convinced that he was the strongest candidate, and he impressed us a great deal during his interview. \"He has a clear vision of the type of football he wants to play, has strong ideas on man-management and demonstrates excellent leadership qualities.

In addition, 155 Palestinians in the Al Tanf refugee camp have been accepted for resettlement in Sweden, it said. Many Palestinians living in Iraq have gotten caught up in the violence that has engulfed the country since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and have had to flee their homes. The U.N.

Pakistan's capital was rocked by a suicide attack on the city's Marriott Hotel at the weekend. Officers emptied the parking lot at the Benazir Bhutto International Airport, on the outskirts of Islamabad, said Parvez George of the country's Civil Aviation Authority. Flights were going out of the airport, but police cleared the terminal building of the large crowds that usually gather to see relatives arrive or depart, George said. Muhammad Asghar of Islamabad Police told CNN that authorities placed the airport on high alert after intelligence reports indicated it was under threat of an attack. The country's capital city is on edge since a deadly blast Saturday night at the Marriott Hotel. The explosion killed more than 50 people, including two U.S. military personnel and the Czech ambassador to Pakistan. The bombing wounded more than 250 and sparked a fire that left the hotel in ruins. On Thursday, the Danish intelligence service said one of its employees, Karsten Krabbe, was among the victims of the blast. Krabbe, a 53-year-old married father of two, was a security adviser at the Danish Embassy in Islamabad, which was targeted by a suicide bomber in June. That attack killed six people and wounded more than 20. \"Karsten Krabbe lost his life in a cowardly and ruthless terror attack,\" the Danish intelligence service said in a statement. Reacting to the Saturday's attack, the U.S. government barred employees from major hotels in several Pakistani cities, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan said. The Embassy in Islamabad added Lahore on Wednesday to a list of three other cities in which U.S. personnel are no longer allowed to visit or stay in major hotels. The Embassy took the measures because of general security concerns, said spokesman Lou Fintor Thursday. He did not comment on a specific threat. In addition to the hotel restriction, the Embassy temporarily suspended visa and other routine consular services for Thursday and Friday.

Paul McCartney says he's looking forward to playing a concert in Israel next month. The show, which will be held September 25 in Tel Aviv, had been rumored for months. Promoters are saying it will be one of the biggest concerts ever held in Israel, and they hope it will encourage other top stars to come to Israel. A web site offering tickets for the concert put prices at 1,500 shekels and 490 shekels or between $426.86 and $139.44 U.S. dollars. Israelis \"will finally get the chance to experience a night of music and history they have been waiting decades for,\" a news release on McCartney's Web site announced Wednesday. Two plane loads of equipment will be arriving with around 100 McCartney production people. The concert will cost around $10 million to produce and the organizers said they are hoping to make a profit. In the mid-1960s, when the Fab Four from Liverpool, England, ruled the music charts, a concert in Israel was proposed. It never happened. The long-told story maintained that Beatlemania was deemed too potentially injurious to Israel's youth. A more recent theory, however, blamed the ban on a tiff between competing concert promoters. Whatever the reason, Israelis never got to experience The Beatles live. Earlier this year, Israel's ambassador to Britain, Ron Prosor, visited Liverpool and apologized to The Beatles for the \"misunderstanding.\" In a letter Prosor wrote: \"There is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you, who shaped the minds of the generation, to come to Israel and perform.\" McCartney and Ringo Starr are the only surviving Beatles.

John McCain as a candidate who is out of touch with the middle class. Sen. Barack Obama speaks about the economy at a campaign event in Detroit, Michigan, on Sunday. Speaking about Friday's presidential debate, Obama accused McCain of not addressing working families. \"We talked about the economy for 40 minutes, and not once did Sen. McCain talk about the struggles that middle class families are facing every day,\" Obama said at a campaign event in Detroit, Michigan. The economy took the lead in Friday night's presidential debate, as both candidates highlighted their plans to bring the United States out of what some are describing as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. McCain on Sunday brushed off Obama's latest line of attack, saying he has \"bigger things to worry about.\" \"Who does he think I was talking about when I said 'people on Main Street'? Who did he think I was talking about, about the necessity of helping the American taxpayers and income -- and Americans who are out there working and trying to keep their jobs?\" he said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I've got bigger things to worry about than that.\" The Republican presidential candidate did address \"Main Street\" in the debate Friday night, saying that \"we've got to fix the system\" because \"Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and on Wall Street.\" Still, Obama's campaign pointed out that McCain didn't specifically say \"middle class,\" during the debate. McCain's campaign said Sunday that during the Michigan event, Obama \"ignored his [Obama's] record of opposing middle class tax relief, opposing a competitive tax rate, and opposing a plan to incentivize new battery technology.\" The campaign said Obama's \"talk about the middle class is much different than his record.\" During the debate, McCain repeatedly said Obama \"doesn't understand\" key issues the country is facing, but at campaign events this weekend, Obama blasted McCain as the candidate who \"doesn't get it.\"  Watch the candidates' plans for the upcoming week \u00bb . \"The truth is, through 90 minutes of debating, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but he had nothing to say about you. Not once did he say the words 'middle class.' Not once did he talk about working families. I think Sen. McCain just doesn't get it,\" Obama said Sunday. The Obama-Biden campaign continues that argument in a new ad that will begin airing nationally on Monday. The ad says when it comes to the economy, McCain \"doesn't get it.\" \"Number of minutes in debate: 90,\" the announcer says as the words are typed across a blank screen. \"Number of times John McCain mentioned the middle class: Zero.\" The 30-second spot, \"Zero,\" includes portions of Friday night's debate where Obama suggested McCain has followed President Bush on economic policy.  Watch the ad \u00bb . A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found when it comes to the economy, 47 percent of voters questioned said Republicans are more responsible for the current economic problems, while 24 percent said Democrats are more responsible. In response to the latest ad, the McCain campaign blasted Obama's tax policy. \"John McCain repeatedly pointed to Sen. Obama's vote in favor of higher taxes on families making just $42,000 a year, and his proposal for $860 billion in lavish new government spending which is a crushing burden on middle class families and the Main Street economy,\" spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a statement Saturday. \"If he was honest, Barack Obama knows he was unable to debate the merits of supporting higher taxes on the middle class, and bloated government spending during a looming economic crisis -- it's simply indefensible.\" The McCain campaign is referring to a June 5, 2008, vote on a resolution (Senate Concurrent Resolution 70) meant to outline the Senate's budget priorities through 2013, but the measure had no practical effect. According to a CNN review of the resolution, it assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts pushed by President Bush will expire in that time, which McCain says amounts to a tax increase. Obama and running mate Sen. Joe Biden voted \"yes\" on the resolution. McCain did not vote. However, the Democrats offered their own cuts in the 48-page resolution, which called for several tax cuts and breaks, including rolling back the alternative-minimum tax and the so-called \"marriage penalty.\" According to an analysis by the independent Tax Policy Center, the tax plan Obama has proposed during the campaign would increase taxes in 2009 on the wealthiest 20 percent of households, while offering tax cuts for the other 80 percent.

A Pakistani official Tuesday bristled at the accusation, saying that Afghan lawmakers were making allegations without proof. \"We are not an irresponsible nation and we don't blame our failures on others,\" said a senior official with Pakistan's Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). \"If they want to engage in this kind of game, let them be.\" The Afghan Cabinet made the scathing indictment in a resolution Monday, saying Afghanistan would boycott a series of meetings with Pakistan unless \"bilateral trust\" is restored. In recent weeks a wave of attacks carried out by Islamic militants have killed scores of people in Afghanistan, including an assault on a military outpost Sunday that killed nine U.S. soldiers, as well as a suicide attack on the Indian Embassy a week ago that killed 58 people. The two incidents, along with an assassination attempt against Afghan President Hamid Karzai at a military ceremony on April 27, are \"indicative of the attempts by the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) to once again occupy Afghanistan and to perish the true right of the people of Afghanistan for national sovereignty,\" the resolution said. Afghanistan regularly accuses Pakistan's intelligence service -- which once had strong ties with the Taliban -- of orchestrating attacks inside its borders. Pakistan has repeatedly denied involvement, including in the incidents that the resolution cited. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates also said there is no indication that \"foreign agents\" were responsible for the embassy attack. The senior ISI official said Tuesday that if Afghanistan has proof that Pakistani intelligence agents were involved in the attacks, that proof should be presented and the ISI will act on it. The official said that the Pakistani government could also blame incidents in Pakistan, like recent attacks in Karachi and Hangu, on others. But without proof, he said, it would be irresponsible. Pakistan and Afghanistan have a tumultuous history that dates back several years. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, religious schools in Pakistan helped train fighters who battled the Soviets. After the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 1996 and imposed fundamentalist rule, Pakistan was one of the few countries that recognized the regime diplomatically. It dropped its support after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in Washington and New York. But Afghanistan claims that Pakistan continues to informally support the militants, who operate from havens in Pakistan's lawless tribal regions near the porous 1,500-mile border the two countries share. Adding fresh ammunition to the suspicions, the Rand Corp. -- a U.S. think tank -- released a report last month that said some members of Pakistan's intelligence service and its paramilitary corps were helping insurgents in Afghanistan. The study, funded by the U.S. Defense Department, alleged that members of the two agencies often tipped off militants to the location and movement of coalition forces trying to rout them. It also said personnel within the agencies trained fighters at camps in Pakistan, financed them and helped them cross the border into Afghanistan. The Pakistani military denied and denounced the report, calling it a \"smear campaign\" designed to \"create doubts and suspicion in the minds of (the) target audience.\" Relations between the two countries are strained to such a point that Karzai has threatened to send troops across the border to take on the militants. \"The people of Afghanistan and the international community have come to the reality that Pakistan intelligence institutions and its army have become the largest center for breeding and exporting terrorism and extremism to the world and particularly to Afghanistan,\" Monday's resolution said.", "6d94f7f790a07b7d38ee1cec6b0a1e1b1ec66a81": "NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Pirates have hijacked a Thai cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden off the Somali coast, the Kenya Seafarers Association said Thursday.

The latest charges come two months after Warren Jeffs and five followers were indicted in Texas. On Tuesday, a Texas grand jury indicted the three male members of Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints compound outside Eldorado, Abbott said. Each faces one felony count of sexual assault of a child. Two of them also face felony bigamy charges. The identities of the men were not released because they had not been arrested as of Tuesday afternoon. In July, the Schleicher County grand jury indicted Jeffs and four of his Texas FLDS followers on child sexual assault charges. Jeffs was charged with sexually assaulting a child under 17. A fifth follower was charged with failure to report child abuse. The charges stem from a state and federal investigation into the sect's Yearning for Zion Ranch. In April, child welfare workers removed more than 400 children from the compound, citing allegations of physical and sexual abuse. After a court battle, the Texas Supreme Court ordered the children returned in June, saying that the state had no right to remove them and that there was no evidence to show the children faced imminent danger of abuse on the ranch. Jeffs, 52, is the leader and \"prophet\" of the estimated 10,000-member FLDS, an offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church. The FLDS openly practices polygamy at the YFZ Ranch and in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state line: Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Jeffs, who is facing a sentence in Utah of up to life in prison and is awaiting trial in Arizona, could face another life sentence in Texas if convicted on the latest charge. In Utah, he was convicted on accomplice to rape charges for his role in the marriage of a sect member to a 14-year-old. He faces similar charges in Arizona. His attorney in Arizona, Michael Piccarreta, has questioned the motives of Texas authorities. He said in July that the state's investigation into Jeffs and his followers is an effort \"to cover themselves up on the botched attack on the ranch in Texas.\"", "d6a9bc3f37a5b71548289cd4c261dbb6a4f93009": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- A New York appeals court Thursday overturned terrorism convictions for a Yemeni cleric and his personal assistant, saying they did not receive a fair trial. Sheik Mohammed Ali al-Moayad and Mohammed Mohsen Zayed, were sentenced in 2005 to 75 and 45 years in prison, respectively, after being convicted of conspiring to provide material support and resources to foreign terrorist organizations. They now can have new trials under a different judge. The lawyer for al-Moayad, Robert Boyle, said, \"I'm extremely gratified at the court's decision. I believe it is legally and factually correct. I hope my client, who is elderly and not in good health, will be given the opportunity to return to his family in Yemen.\" The three-judge panel was unanimous in its decision, citing evidentiary errors that likely influenced the outcome of the trial. The judges found that certain pieces of evidence presented by prosecutors were prejudicial and had the effect of denying al-Moayad and Zayed a fair trial. Zayed and al-Moayad were arrested in 2003 in a sting operation that culminated in Germany. The government's case relied largely on secretly videotaped conversations between the defendants and a pair of undercover FBI informants at a Frankfurt hotel in 2003. One of the informants, Mohamed Alanssi, testified that al-Moayad boasted about giving money, weapons and recruits to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The charges were brought in the Eastern District of New York because al-Moayad allegedly collected terrorist funds at the al-Farooq mosque in Brooklyn. Now that the appeals court has vacated the convictions, prosecutors have the option of appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court if they feel there is a constitutional issue. They can retry the case or move to dismiss. Al-Moayad, who is in his 60s, is incarcerated at the Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, as is Zayed.

The week before Gates' announcement, McKiernan had asked for four more brigades -- three more than the one approved to go in January. Three brigades add up to as many as 12,000 troops.

Michael McConnell. Gov. Sarah Palin is in New York to meet with leaders from around the world. The appearances with world leaders, taking place on the sidelines of the United Nation's General Assembly meetings in New York, come as the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain tries to convince voters that Palin is ready for the world stage. Palin's top foreign policy adviser informed reporters of the meeting at a small briefing after Palin's visits with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The adviser, Stephen Biegun, formerly a top member of the National Security Council under President Bush, characterized the intelligence briefing as \"routine\" and said it was the sort of meeting that \"is standard for candidates for the vice president and president.\" Biegun said several officials were present to brief Palin. Although Palin held photo-ops with the leaders, she refused to take questions from any reporters. The Alaska governor initially said that no reporters would be allowed to sit in on her meeting with Karzai. She planned to allow in only photographers and one television crew, but she changed her position after at least five U.S. news networks protested. CNN does not send cameras into candidate events where editorial presence is not allowed. Nonetheless, Biegun said, \"these are relationships that she intuitively understands are very important for the next president and vice president of the United States.\" In those get-togethers, Palin kept the focus primarily on energy issues and the growing influence of Russia, according to Biegun. Palin found Kissinger particularly engrossing; their meeting had been scheduled to last 30 minutes, but the two met for nearly an hour and a half. \"In talking to Dr. Kissinger,\" Biegun said, \"she certainly had a lot of questions about how the United States can develop a cooperative relationship with Russia, what are some of the unique challenges to the current state of Russia's political development, and having been in particular, some of the recent developments we've seen with Russia: backsliding democracy, Russia's incursion into Georgia.\" Asked about her meetings with Karzai and Uribe, Biegun said Palin \"liked them very much\" and \"established a great personal rapport.\" With Karzai, Palin chatted for half an hour about McCain's desire to send more U.S. troops to Afghanistan. With Uribe, she listened for about 20 minutes as the president discussed the country's security situation and its handling of guerrillas. According to Biegun, \"rather than make specific policy prescriptions, she was largely listening, having an exchange of views, and also very interested in forming a relationship with people she met with today.\" Biegun is helping prepare Palin for her debate with Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Joseph Biden on October 2 in St. Louis, Missouri. He would not say what specific topics Palin was concentrating on in her study sessions. James Hoge of the Council on Foreign Relations, said the Palin meetings are meant to \"show, just as [Democratic presidential nominee Sen.

Democrats warn that Palin's carefully scripted photo-ops, some of which will include McCain, could backfire by bringing attention to the holes in her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \"The big risk that they run with this strategy of having her meet with these leaders individually is that they end up with three days of stories about how she doesn't have foreign policy experience,\" said Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist and CNN contributor. But Republicans point out that Palin is just following in the footsteps of other national candidates such as Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, former governors who needed to beef up their international policy credentials. \"The first thing you do is burnish their foreign policy credentials. You buy them a Rand-McNally, you meet with generals, you get a lot of flags on the stage, and you give a big speech on foreign policy to display you have some command of the world,\" said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor. As a 44-year-old governor who just got her passport last year, she has had to fend off accusations that she is not up to speed on foreign policy. In a recent interview with ABC, she admitted that she has never met with a head of state. Asked last week for specific skills she could cite to rebut critics who question her grasp of international affairs, she replied, \"I am prepared.\" \"I have that confidence. I have that readiness,\" Palin told voters at a town-hall meeting in Grand Rapids, Michigan. \"And if you want specifics with specific policies or countries, you can go ahead and ask me. You can play 'stump the candidate' if you want to. But we are ready to serve.\" McCain stepped in, pointing out that as governor of a state that has plenty of oil and gas, Palin was familiar with energy. She knows it to be \"one of our great national security challenges,\" he said. He also cited her nearly two years as commander of Alaska's National Guard. \"I believe she is absolutely, totally qualified to address every challenge as the next vice president of the United States,\" McCain said.

The Treasury's action, termed a \"designation,\" also prohibited Americans from conducting business with FARC. \"Today's designation exposes eight 'International Commission members' of the FARC,\" said Adam Szubin, director of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. \"Through their service to the FARC as international representatives and negotiators, these persons provide material support to a narco-terrorist organization.\" The organization, comprised of Colombian leftist rebels, is best known as FARC, its Spanish acronym. The eight in Tuesday's designation represent the FARC in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, Panama, Mexico and Canada, the Treasury Department alleged. \"As representatives of the FARC and members of its International Commission, these individuals work abroad to obtain recruits, support and protection for the FARC's acts of terrorism,\" the department said in a written statement. \"Some are also themselves violent criminals.\" One, Jairo Alfonse Lesmes Bulla, was arrested in August for allegedly plotting the assassinations of some South American officials, Treasury said. Bulla represents FARC in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay, according to the department. Another, Orlay Jurado Palomino, who represents FARC in Venezuela, is wanted in Colombia on charges of kidnapping, rebellion and terrorism, the department said.

As part of the Kashubian minority living in the Gdansk Region, he was born to working-class parents -- his father a carpenter and his mother a nurse. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected in November 2007. As a student of History at the University of Gdansk in the late 1970s, a period of growing discontent with the Communist regime in Poland, he became actively involved in the creation of the opposition Students' Solidarity Committee, founded in reaction to the murder of student activist Stanislaw Pyjas by the State Security Service. Despite his anti-communist activities, he successfully finished his studies in 1980 and joined the Independent Solidarity Trade Union movement. When the Communists imposed martial law in 1981 he continued with his underground activities, writing pamphlets about the ideas of liberal economist Friedrich Hayek and the concept of private property. His heroes became former U.S. president Ronald Reagan and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. With the fall of Communism in 1989, the Solidarity Movement splintered. Lech Walesa, the former Solidarity Leader was elected President, while Tusk went on to co-found the KLD (Liberal and Democratic Congress Party) with other well-known figures. The Party stood for among other things: free market economy, privatization, individual freedom of Polish citizens and Polish accession to the EU. The following year, during the 1991 Parliamentary elections, the KLD won 37 seats in the lower house of the Polish Parliament. Not being able to follow up on their success in the 1993 elections, the KLD merged with the larger Democratic Union Party (UD) to form a new party called Freedom Union (UW). Tusk soon became Deputy Chairman and in the 1997 elections, he was voted into the Senate. In 2001, Tusk formed the Civic Platform Party (PO), winning seats in that year's parliamentary elections and becoming Deputy Speaker in parliament. But the Civic Platform was not able to sustain its success in the 2005 elections. Tusk and his party lost both the presidential and parliamentary elections to Lech Kacczynski's PiS (Law and Justice Party). This setback was not to last as Tusk triumphed over Jaroslaw Kaczynsky's PiS in the October 2007 elections and became prime minister of Poland. Tusk's economic policies are pro-business: less bureaucratic hurdles and state interference making it easier for entrepreneurs to start businesses. He is also trying to woo back more than a million Poles who left the country to work in other European Union countries after it joined the EU in 2004. Tusk is a keen footballer, viewed in his youth as a promising striker. He is married to historian Malgorzata and has two children, Kasia and Michal.", "dbab58215a337dbab8f418c6945c319d1845bd63": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- In a column appearing in Newsweek, world affairs expert and author Fareed Zakaria said he thinks it would be best for Republican presidential hopeful John McCain if Gov. Sarah Palin bowed out as his vice presidential running mate. \"For him to choose Sarah Palin to be his running mate is fundamentally irresponsible,\" says Zakaria. Zakaria says McCain did not put the country first in making his V.P. choice, and he says Palin is not qualified to lead the United States. CNN spoke to him about his commentary titled, \"Palin is ready? Please.\" CNN: What did you initially think when Sarah Palin was announced as the Republican vice presidential nominee? Zakaria: I was a bit surprised -- as I think most people were. But I was willing to give her a chance. And I thought her speech at the convention was clever and funny. But once she began answering questions about economics and foreign policy, it became clear that she has simply never thought about these subjects before and is dangerously ignorant and unprepared for the job of vice president, let alone president.  Watch Zakaria slam Sarah Palin \u00bb . CNN: You don't think she is qualified? Zakaria: No. Gov. Palin has been given a set of talking points by campaign advisers, simple ideological mantras that she repeats and repeats as long as she can. But if forced off those rehearsed lines, what she has to say is often, quite frankly -- nonsense. Just listen to her response to Katie Couric's question about the bailout. It's gibberish -- an emptying out of catchphrases about economics that have nothing to do with the question or the topic. It's scary to think that this person could be running the country. Here is their exchange: . Katie Couric: Why isn't it better, Gov. Palin, to spend $700 billion helping middle-class families who are struggling with health care, housing, gas and groceries; allow them to spend more and put more money into the economy instead of helping these big financial institutions that played a role in creating this mess? Gov. Sarah Palin: That's why I say I, like every American I'm speaking with, we're ill about this position that we have been put in where it is the taxpayers looking to bail out. But ultimately, what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health-care reform that is needed to help shore up our economy, helping the -- it's got to be all about job creation, too, shoring up our economy and putting it back on the right track. So health-care reform and reducing taxes and reining in spending has got to accompany tax reductions and tax relief for Americans. And trade, we've got to see trade as opportunity, not as a competitive, scary thing. But one in five jobs being created in the trade sector today, we've got to look at that as more opportunity. All those things under the umbrella of job creation. This bailout is a part of that. CNN: But Dan Quayle wasn't very qualified and that didn't seem to matter, did it? Zakaria: This is way beyond Dan Quayle. Quayle was a lightweight who was prone to scramble his words, or say things that sounded weird, but you almost always knew what he meant. One of his most famous miscues was to the United Negro College Fund when he said, \"What a terrible thing to have lost one's mind. Or not to have a mind at all.\" Now he was trying to play off a famous ad that the group used to run, \"A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste.\" And he screwed it up in a funny way. But read Gov. Palin's answers and it does appear that she doesn't have any understanding about the topic under discussion. CNN: But she has a lot of supporters. Zakaria: Look, I'm not saying that she is not a feisty, charismatic politician who has done some good things in Alaska. It is just we are talking about a person who should be ready to lead the United States at a moment's notice. She has never spent a day thinking about any important national or international issue, and this is a hell of a time to start. CNN: Does it make you concerned about Sen. McCain as a president? Zakaria: Yes, and I say this with sadness because I greatly admire John McCain, a man of intelligence, honor and enormous personal and political courage. However, for him to choose Sara Palin to be his running mate is fundamentally irresponsible. He did not put the country first with this decision. Whether it is appropriate or not, considering Sen. McCain's age most people expected to have a vice presidential candidate who would be ready to step in at a moment's notice. The actuarial odds of that happening are significant, something like a one-in-five chance.", "78c48eca0267156fb6eef4c2d9da5b70919d2235": "JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni declared victory Thursday in an election to lead the ruling Kadima Party, putting her on a path that could make her Israel's first female prime minister in 34 years. Kadima candidate Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni is the chief Israeli negotiator with the Palestinian Authority. Livni won with 43.1 percent of the vote, claiming a 431-vote margin of victory over Transportation Minister Shaul Mofaz, the Kadima Party said. Mofaz announced Thursday he will take a \"time out\" from politics and will resign his seat in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. But he indicated he does not intend his departure from front-line politics to be permanent. Livni's election marks a stunning rise for the 50-year-old, who entered the Knesset less than 10 years ago. \"It's a leap of faith for the people,\" analyst Avi Shavit said. \"They decided to trust a candidate they don't know much about.\" She may owe her victory over Mofaz, a former general, to her reputation for clean hands in a party losing its leader to allegations of graft. \"Kadima members are more concerned about the corruption threat inside Israel than the security threat from Hamas and Iran,\" Israeli columnist Gil Hoffman said. As new leader of the ruling party, Livni will try to form a coalition government and become prime minister after the departure of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who has been dogged by allegations of corruption. Olmert plans to inform the Cabinet on Sunday that he will resign, said Mark Regev, his spokesman. He has congratulated Livni and pledged to help make a smooth transition, according to Regev. Livni told reporters Thursday that she intends \"to bring together Kadima factions and to go on this new path together.\"  Watch Livni at the ballot box \u00bb . Her slim margin of victory stood in contrast to exit polls that had shown her with a commanding lead over Mofaz and other rivals. Mofaz telephoned Livni to congratulate her on the victory, according to Israel Radio. Livni said she hoped to ensure stability in Israel's government. \"We need to face complicated threats. We need to face security threats. We need to move forward, and there is economic instability,\" she said. Livni has about 42 days to form a coalition government. If she fails, there could be early elections that could see another party leader elected as Olmert's successor to the prime minister post. There are many possible scenarios that could take place in the following months. Ehud Barak -- leader of the Labor Party, which holds the most parliamentary seats among Kadima's coalition partners -- could pull out of the coalition. That could force early elections, or force the government to take on new coalition partners who could restrict Livni's ability to negotiate with the Palestinians. If elections are called, Barak, a former prime minister, could vie for the top spot -- but polls show he may not have enough support. Some observers think that former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, head of the opposition Likud Party, could steal the show in the end. Whoever succeeds Olmert as prime minister will be handed a set of daunting challenges, including determining the fate of Israel's talks with the Palestinians, its fledgling indirect talks with Syria and its tough talk on Iran's nuclear aspirations. Livni, who is more widely known outside Israel than her main challenger, is the chief Israeli negotiator with the Palestinian Authority as the two sides work toward a peace deal. She refuses to be tied to the Bush administration's vision of a peace deal by the end of this year. \"We want to reach an agreement which at the end of the agreement we can find the words 'end of conflict,'\" she said. \"And in doing so, it takes time.\" To her supporters, she is squeaky-clean and a welcome change to Olmert, whose resignation comes amid mounting corruption charges. \"She's very honest, very sincere and I hope she's going to do whatever she says,\" one of her supporters said. \"We have to give her a chance and I'm willing to do it.\" CNN's Paula Hancocks and Michal Zippori contributed to this report.", "e1cacfb3827c96ed975488a0f3627cabe5d182ba": "(CNN) -- Tokyo may not be traditionally beautiful and it has few historic sights, but it is undeniably spectacular.

The U.S. Navy released this observance  photo of the MV Faina, which is loaded with weapons and tanks. But the Russian navy issued a statement later in the day saying it had no intention of using force against the pirates, the Russian news agency Interfax reported. \"The questions of freeing the ships and crew are being dealt with in line with the corresponding international practices,\" Interfax quoted Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo as saying. \"For understandable reasons, the use of force would be an extreme measure because it could threaten the life of the international crew of the ship.\" The pirates took over the MV Faina last week off the coast of Somalia and are demanding a $20 million ransom for the ship's cargo of 33 Soviet-made T-72 tanks, tank artillery shells, grenade launchers and small arms. The ship is anchored within Somalia's 12-mile territorial limit. \"The government and the president of Somalia are allowing the Russian naval ships to enter our waters, and fight against pirates both in the sea and on the land, that is, if they would have to chase them,\" Amb. Mohamed Handule said at a news conference in Moscow. \"We think that this issue of piracy has exceeded all limits. It is very dangerous that pirates are now laying their hands on arms -- not just for Somalia, not only for the navigating, but for the entire region in general,\" he added. \"Right now, pirates are controlling the sea in this area, but just imagine if they get control of the land too.\" The announcement raised concern among some officials monitoring the situation.  Watch Russian warships move to confront pirates \u00bb . \"We may have bad news,\" said Andrew Mwangura of the Kenya Seafarers Association. Mwangura said some of the Ukrainian crew's family members are concerned for their loved ones' safety and have called him to see if he can communicate with the pirates. He urged negotiations to continue. \"For the safety of the crew members,\" Mwangura said, \"let the ship owners talk with the pirates.\"  Watch Mwangura talk about the rise in pirating \u00bb . A Russian navy ship sailing toward the Faina is in the Atlantic Ocean and \"still has a bit of water to get here,\" said U.S. Navy Lt. Stephanie Murdock, who is stationed in nearby Bahrain. \"There is no estimated time of arrival yet.\" The U.S. Navy has several ships in the area monitoring the situation. \"There have been no changes today,\" Murdock said. The Navy has not communicated with the Russian ship but will work out coordination when it arrives, Murdock said. The Russian ship Neustrashimy is headed to the region solely to protect Russian shipping, according to the Russian navy spokesman. \"The navy command has been stressing that the Neustrashimy, from the Baltic Sea Fleet, has been given the task of arriving in the area of Somalia and guaranteeing for a certain time the safe seafaring of Russian ships in the area with a high risk of pirate attacks. The essence of the mission is to prevent the seizure of Russian ships by pirates,\" Dygalo said. Handule, the Nigerian ambassador, seemed to criticize the United States for not taking action. \"Ships of more than 10 countries are now close to our shores, but we are not satisfied with the results of their activities,\" he said. Citing U.N. Security Council Resolution 1816, Handule said, \"We are inviting all countries, all states who have possibility to support Somalia to fight against ... pirates. We are especially inviting Russia and giving special status to Russian warships to fight, to help Somalia.\" The latest developments came two days after three pirates were killed when they started shooting at each other, according to Mwangura, the Kenya maritime official. The shootout centered on a disagreement between moderate and radical pirates aboard the ship, Mwangura said. The moderates wanted to surrender, but the radicals did not. The pirates hijacked the ship off the coast of Somalia September 25. The Faina had been headed to the Kenyan port of Mombasa after departing from Nikolayev, Ukraine, and was seized not far from its destination. The Faina is owned and operated by Kaalbye Shipping Ukraine, and its crew includes citizens of Ukraine, Russia and Latvia, the Navy said. Abdi Salan Khalif, commissioner of the coastal town of Harardhere, told CNN the pirates told a group of town elders that one crew member had died of high blood pressure problems. Attacks by pirates have increased dramatically in the waters off Somalia's northern coast in the past year, prompting the U.S. and other coalition warships to widen their patrols in the region. Three ships were hijacked on August 21 in that area, the \"worst number of attacks\" in a single day in many years, Capt. Pottengal Mukudan of the International Maritime Bureau told CNN. After the spate of attacks, the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain announced that it would begin patrolling a newly established shipping corridor in the Gulf of Aden in an attempt to protect international shipping. Canada also sent a warship through the end of September. The International Maritime Bureau said in April that 49 pirate attacks on ships were reported in the first three months of 2008, compared with 41 for the same period last year. It recorded 263 pirates attacks last year, up from 239 the year before and the first increase in three years.", "fa63a1de6e9f16a60f4db756c20cce20ada19a2b": "(CNN) -- It used to be called \"the love that dare not speak its name\" -- particularly in Hollywood, where the revelation of homosexuality was believed to be a career-killer. Clay Aiken recently announced he was gay on the cover of People magazine. Now, out gays and lesbians are as casually visible as the cover of People magazine, which has recently run stories on Ellen DeGeneres' wedding to Portia de Rossi and Clay Aiken's decision to discuss his sexuality. So, in a time when self-declared bisexual Tila Tequila can have a highly rated MTV show on looking for a partner of either sex, Lindsay Lohan talks about her relationship with DJ Samantha Ronson and \"Star Trek's\" George Takei can have a very public wedding with his longtime partner, is coming out still a big deal? Publicist Howard Bragman, author of the forthcoming \"Where's My Fifteen Minutes\" (Portfolio), says that it is. \"Every person that comes out is another barrier coming down,\" Bragman, who is openly gay, told CNN.com. Acceptance by the mainstream public, he observes, is easier but by no means automatic, particularly when issues such as gay marriage are at stake. \"I look at it as a long-term process. The revolution is over -- now it's an evolution.\"  Watch \"American Morning's\" Lola Ogunnaike look at changing attitudes \u00bb . Bragman was around when a performer revealing his or her homosexuality could still shock. He helped guide Dick Sargent when the \"Bewitched\" star came out of the closet in 1989, and remembers when it was difficult to get support for movies such as \"Philadelphia,\" the 1993 film that won Tom Hanks an Oscar as a lawyer dying of AIDS. Now, he observes, there are gay actors -- \"How I Met My Mother's\" Neil Patrick Harris may be the most notable -- playing straight roles, something that would have been almost unthinkable even a few years ago, since studios have often been nervous casting known gay performers in straight roles. \" 'We'll buy Hanks as a gay man but not the opposite,' \" Bragman describes the industry thinking. Indeed, there are now more gay characters in prime-time television than ever. Shows such as \"Ugly Betty,\" \"The Office\" and \"Grey's Anatomy\" feature gay or bisexual characters, and this fall, five more will hit the airwaves, bringing the total to 16, according to a study by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). \"It's certainly positive that there is such a dramatic increase,\" GLAAD's president, Neil Giuliano, told CNN. \"Number one, it reflects society, and the fact that we are more visible, and it also makes good television. Portrayals are almost more honest and real.\" Peter Sprigg, vice president of policy for the conservative Family Research Council, doesn't agree. \"I'm convinced that for the most part, these characters are placed on television for propaganda purposes, in order to persuade people to be more accepting of homosexual conduct,\" he told CNN. \"In that sense, the result for society is likely to be negative.\" But Bryan Batt, the gay actor who plays the closeted Salvatore Romano on the Emmy-winning \"Mad Men,\" says that viewers are more accepting of gay characters today, though concerns linger. \"Yes, I did think maybe this going to hurt me career-wise [to come out], but I come from Broadway and a lot of theater background. So, you know, no one really cares ... you don't have to be straight to act straight. You don't have to be gay to play gay,\" he told CNN.  Watch Batt talk about the challenges of a gay actor \u00bb . But, he adds, \"There is, I think, a little bit of homophobia. I do believe that through education and seeing good, honest, positive gay role models, it will just educate. I think we are producing generations now of youth that do not judge people; they don't judge people on their race or their religion or their sexuality.\" April Woodard, a correspondent for \"Inside Edition,\" told CNN Headline News' \"Showbiz Tonight\" that rejection may have been on Aiken's mind. The singer, a born-again Christian, had long declined to talk about his sexuality, and with a strong Middle American fan base, may have been afraid of a backlash. \"There are definitely going to be some people in the South where he lives that aren't going to agree with it, and some of the Christians are not going to agree with his lifestyle and even having a child out of wedlock,\" she said. For his part, Aiken -- who recently became the father to a newborn son -- told People that coming out \"was the first decision I made as a father. I cannot raise a child to lie or hide things. ... I've never intended to lie to anybody at all. The fans, if they leave, they leave. But if they leave, I don't want them hating me.\" Bragman believes Aiken will be more successful than ever. \"I'm sure, anecdotally, you'll have people not buying the next Aiken album because he's gay, but it will be statistically insignificant. If you're a fan, you're a fan,\" he said. Aiken and other gay celebrities have generally received support from their colleagues and the public. \"Heroes\" star Kristen Bell, who is straight, told CNN that \"[Aiken] shouldn't really have to acknowledge it.\" \"What surprises and saddens me is that it still is big news,\" she said. But Bragman observes that the decision to come out remains intensely personal. \"It's not a career move -- it's a personal move,\" he said. \"[It's saying,] 'I need to do this for me.' \" There are still many performers and industry notables, he says, who threaten to sue if their sexuality is revealed. Others live gay social lives but don't talk about their sexuality -- the so-called \"glass closet.\" And, as Bragman notes, gay stars are generally from the second tier: \"There are still no A-list movie stars out of the closet, there are still no superstar athletes,\" he said. \"It's great to see how far we've come,\" he said. \"[And] we all long for the day when it's a nonstory. But we're not there yet.\"", "7890546606d341c9570b4e9aa96936b25b4fdd31": "ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish authorities have arrested 13 people in connection with blasts that killed 17 people in Istanbul last week, Interior Minister Besir Atalay said Saturday.

After record-setting Olympics athlete Stella Walsh died in 1980, it was revealed that she had indeed been a man. And I'm not talking about people who live this way out of personal preference, or those who dress up for theater and entertainment. Here are just five examples. 1. Cross-dressing to join the army . Until recently, women have rarely been allowed to serve as soldiers. So what was a gal to do if she wanted to serve her country? Naturally, disguise herself as a man and join the troops. At least 400 Civil War soldiers were women in drag. These included Union Army soldier \"Frank Thompson\" (also known as Sarah Edmonds), whose small frame and feminine mannerisms (rather than causing suspicion) made her an ideal spy, as she could spy on the Confederates disguised as... a woman! She wasn't the first woman to don a male disguise and join the army, though. During the Revolutionary War, women fought as men on both sides. Hannah Snell, for example, joined the British army to find her husband, who had walked out on her to enlist. Once her true sex was discovered (thanks to a pesky groin injury), she became a national celebrity in Britain, and made a post-war career of performing in bars as the \"Female Warrior.\" Mental Floss: The Confederacy's plan to conquer Latin America . 2. Cross-dressing to keep a royal family together . With all the power play that went on in the court, the French royal family would go to great lengths to avoid sibling rivalry. In one of the more extreme cases, Philippe I, Duke of Orleans (1640-1701), was raised as a girl to discourage him from any political or military aspirations. This would make things easier for his brother, the future King Louis XIV. Philippe wore dresses and make-up, enjoyed traditionally feminine pursuits, and was even encouraged towards homosexuality. A girly man he might have been, but he married twice and even had a mistress. When necessary, he could even lead an army into battle. (This is the nation, after all, that gave us that famous cross-dresser Joan of Arc.) A brave commander, he would go into battle wearing high heels, plenty of jewelry and a long, perfumed wig. One of his wives claimed that Philippe's biggest fear when going into battle was not bullets, but the possibility of looking a mess. He avoided gunpowder (with the black smoke stains) and didn't wear a hat, to avoid ruining his hair. Mental Floss: 11 weird & wonderful wedding rings . 3. Cross-dressing to win Olympic glory . Dressing in drag has been part of the Olympics (on and off) since ancient times, when women were banned from the bulk of the Games. The Greek historian Pausanias of Damascus said that if a spectator was uncovered as a woman in male disguise, she was duly escorted off the premises... and thrown off a cliff. In later Games, the athletes started performing naked, and the crowd was also ordered to disrobe. It has been suggested that this was to ensure that they were all men. In the modern Olympics, there has been less disrobing -- and not much cross-dressing, either. Gender tests have been normal procedure since 1966 (for athletes, not spectators), so they couldn't really get away with it. Before that time, one of the strangest -- and most controversial -- cases was Polish sprinter Stanislawa Walasiewicz (aka Stella Walsh), who set 11 world records in her career, winning the 100-meter Olympic finals in 1932 with what one official described as \"long man-like strides.\" After she died in 1980, however, it was revealed that she had indeed been a man. So had he deliberately set out to fool everyone all that time? Perhaps not. Walasiewicz had a condition known as \"mosaicism,\" which gave her male chromosomes. Did they give her an unfair advantage? It is difficult to say. However, if she tried out for the Olympics today, she would not be allowed to compete as a woman. Mental Floss: 13 medal-worthy Olympic stories . 4. Cross-dressing to commit espionage . There have been many instances of cross-dressing spies (including Sarah Edmonds, mentioned above), but one of the most impressive deceptions in history was carried out by Shi Pei-Pu, a singer with the Beijing Opera (in which, traditionally, all roles are played by men). In 1964 he disguised himself as a woman to seduce Bernard Boursicot, an attache in the French Foreign Service. Their affair lasted 20 years (on and off), during which Boursicot passed several official documents to Shi, believing that \"her\" safety was at risk if he didn't participate. After they were separated in 1965, Shi came back into Boursicot's life by claiming to be pregnant, and even revealed a baby boy. They later lived as a family. The happy couple was eventually arrested for espionage in 1983, and Shi's secret was revealed, Crying Game style, to the stunned Boursicot. But how did they have this romance for so long without Bousicot knowing the truth? Officially, they rarely made love, and always did it hurriedly and in darkness -- something that Boursicot always ascribed to Shi's demure Chinese upbringing. One theory, however, is that he always knew the truth, but played dumb to conceal his homosexuality. (He later came out.) The affair was the basis for the play \"M. Butterfly.\" It was filmed in 1993, starring Jeremy Irons and former Beijing Opera player John Lone (better known for the title role in the film \"The Last Emperor\"). 5. Cross-dressing to get rowdy . Hindu women in India have traditionally lived inhibited lives, tending the home for their families. But on one night each year, in the city of Jodhpur, they come to life at the so-called \"Festival of Fun.\" Dressed as noblemen, complete with turbans and large fake mustaches, they walk the streets in gangs, brandishing sticks, beating any males who are foolish enough to be out there. The festival celebrates an ancient domestic dispute between the Hindu god Shiva and his wife Ganwar. While the women sing devotional songs asking the goddess to return to her husband, they also take this as their only opportunity to do what they long to do all year: behave like men. Their husbands, respecting the tradition, let them go wild. It sounds like fun (as long as you're not a clueless male who forgot to stay at home that night), but one thing concerns me: if a woman's disguise is especially good, does she risk being mistaken for a man and beaten up by her friends?

Prince William has helped bust a speed boat smuggling $80 million worth of cocaine. William, who is serving in the Royal Navy, helped make the bust last weekend when he spotted a speedboat found to be carrying nearly a ton of cocaine in the Atlantic Ocean, Britain's Ministry of Defense said Wednesday. William, 26, was one of the crew members aboard a helicopter attached to the frigate HMS Iron Duke who spotted the ocean-going speedboat hundreds of miles northeast of Barbados, the defense ministry said . The 50-foot-long power boat raised suspicions because it was a small vessel far out to sea and resembled a \"go-fast\" boat commonly used for drug smuggling, the ministry said. The boat's location suggested it was en route to Europe or North Africa, it said. The chopper's crew informed the ship's captain about the boat, and U.S. Coast Guard personnel who were on the frigate then boarded the boat. They found 45 bales of cocaine weighing a total of 900 kilograms (just under a ton), the defense ministry said. The cocaine has a minimum street value of $80 million, the ministry said. The bust went smoothly with no violence, defense officials said. Navy crew detained the five men on the boat, which was in poor condition and later sank. William is in the middle of a two-month attachment with the Royal Navy as part of his continued experience with various branches of the military. The prince, who is called sub lieutenant Wales in the navy, is also expected to spend time aboard a mine hunter and submarine during his attachment, which ends August 1. William's vessel, the Iron Duke, is a patrol boat which supports overseas British territories in the event of a hurricane and carries out counter-narcotic operations. William completed a four-month attachment with the Royal Air Force earlier this year and received his pilot's wings on graduation in April. He learned to fly three different aircraft during the attachment and is known as Flying Officer Wales within the RAF. William is already a second lieutenant in the British Army, where he serves in the Blues and Royals regiment of the Household Cavalry. The attachments are designed to give the prince, who as king will be the head of the armed forces, experience with the military.", "37021bdeab99868d4e336da109890f3f10e89461": "Editor's note: Bryan Batt, who plays the closeted art director Salvatore Romano in the Emmy award-winning cable TV series \"Mad Men,\" has acted in nine Broadway and nine Off-Broadway productions, such as \"Sunset Boulevard,\" \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Jeffrey\" and \"Starlight Express.\" Batt, who is 45, has been acting for 23 years. He spoke to CNN.com about being an openly gay actor. \"We have to work toward acceptance on all levels,\" says actor Bryan Batt, who is openly gay. (CNN) -- There was once a time when the revelation of one's homosexuality in Hollywood was thought to be a career-killer. Now, out gays and lesbians such as TV host Ellen DeGeneres and pop singer Clay Aiken are featured on the cover of People magazine. There are also more gay characters on prime-time television shows than ever before. But even with greater acceptance by the mainstream public, is coming out still a big deal? To shed light on the issue, CNN recently spoke to Bryan Batt, 45, about his experience as an openly gay actor in Hollywood. CNN: Has being openly gay affected your career? Batt: I came from the stage; much of my experience has been on the Broadway and Off-Broadway stage. Being gay never really posed a problem. In the Broadway community, it's always been a little more accepted. There's something different with film acting and TV acting. You're in someone's home -- it's more intimate. When I look at someone, I really don't care about whom they're sleeping with or what they're doing. I'm thinking they either have talent or no talent. But people are really obsessed with wanting to know about the ins and outs of people's private lives. It's still like high school.  Batt plays both straight, gay roles \u00bb . CNN: When did you come out? Batt: My real Broadway break was in \"Starlight Express.\" At that time, I was toying with [coming out]. It's harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be. I've heard of people doing it in Hollywood. It's a very sad and difficult choice. I think it's a personal journey, and I think people on their own time will figure it out. Clay Aiken is still really very, very young; he has to deal with his own issues. Thank God, when it was my time, no one was pushing me; no one was trying to force me. It was on my own terms intimately with my mother and brother. It went wonderfully. My mother said, \"No matter what, you're my son. I'm going to love you.\" Not one of my family or friends turned their back on me. I was fortunate, but it was still a very difficult thing to do, and I was fearful. Afterwards, it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back; all those years worrying for nothing. But not everyone is as lucky; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families, which is criminal. Just this year, I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation, a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and cannot afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization. I only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in \"Jeffrey,\" a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy. I said to myself, if I get this, I've just got to sit down and talk with my family. My partner and I have been together 19 years, and that was the same time he told his parents. A good parent knows; they love and accept. What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society. CNN: Are there barriers to what openly gay actors can do today? Batt: It's just like any prejudice, once you let go of any prejudice they all have to go. They're not based on facts, just on stereotypes. I really think yes, there might be some homophobia in Hollywood, but it's based on what will sell. Hollywood is a huge industry, a multibillion-dollar business. If actors who are gay will get ratings and will sell, they will get cast. There are always going to be people who look at people who are different and who disapprove [of them] either through fear or through ignorance. We have to work toward acceptance on all levels. How long ago were the civil rights movement and the women's movement? And, still today, women don't make the same amount of money as men do for doing the same job. CNN: What's your view of the character you play, Salvatore Romano, in \"Mad Men\"? Batt: The character basically is clearly gay to a 2007 audience, but no one in the world of 1960 is suspicious whatsoever. What a great role to play. This season, I'm married. I get stopped all the time on the street, and I get asked, \"When is your character coming out?\" What is he coming out to in 1962? I asked to get married this season. I thanked [series creator] Matthew Weiner, and he said, \"You asked.\" It provides another wonderful level to the character. That is what happened then and unfortunately still happens today. [In a recent episode, the \"Gold Violin,\"] the scene with my wife, it was just so poignant and painful, someone said to me that what she loved about the episode was that we clearly did love each other. We were like the gold violin, we were beautiful but we just didn't make music . CNN: What would you like to see Hollywood do? Batt: Continue to reward good work and put positive role models out there. The one thing about \"Brokeback Mountain\" -- it was a beautifully filmed and acted film depicting a tortured relationship. The reason I thought the movie was so great is people walked away thinking, \"Why couldn't they just be together?\" The more positive or interesting the portrayal of gay and lesbian characters, the better. They should show people who are living their good, healthy, responsible, productive lives as role models who just happen to be gay.

Somalis prepare Monday to bury murdered Osman Ali Ahmed, the head of the U.N. Development Program. The first fatality was a Somali, Mohamed Mohamud Qeyre. He was the deputy director of the group Daryeel Bulasho Guud (DBG), funded by a German company and affiliated with the group Bread for the World. Qeyre was shot in the Somali capital of Mogadishu Friday night in what appeared to be a targeted attack, the reports said. He was shot by three gunmen outside the facility where aid distribution is coordinated. The gunmen may have been staking out the facility waiting for Qeyre to exit. The head of DBG, in Nairobi, Kenya, said he will suspend all aid operations in Somalia for the time being. The second fatality was a member of the Sodra nongovernmental organization, which is helping with humanitarian efforts in Somalia. Officials said it appears that Ali Baashi was also specifically targeted by gunmen. Earlier this week, the World Food Program said a truck driver carrying its relief supplies was killed -- the fourth WFP driver killed in Somalia this year. Ahmed Saalim was shot when fighting broke out between convoy escorts and militiamen at a checkpoint, the U.N. aid agency said.

The future of television? This image is an impression of what 3D holographic television may look like. It sounds a lot like a wacky dream, but don't be surprised if within our lifetime you find yourself discarding your plasma and LCD sets in exchange for a holographic 3-D television that can put Cristiano Ronaldo in your living room or bring you face-to-face with life-sized versions of your gaming heroes. The reason for renewed optimism in three-dimensional technology is a breakthrough in rewritable and erasable holographic systems made earlier this year by researchers at the University of Arizona. Dr Nasser Peyghambarian, chair of photonics and lasers at the university's Optical Sciences department, told CNN that scientists have broken a barrier by making the first updatable three-dimensional displays with memory. \"This is a prerequisite for any type of moving holographic technology. The way it works presently is not suitable for 3-D images,\" he said. The researchers produced displays that can be erased and rewritten in a matter of minutes. To create television sets the images would need to be changing multiple times each second -- but Peyghambarian is very optimistic this can happen. He said the University of Arizona team, which is now ten-strong, has been working on advancing hologram technology since 1990 -- so this is a major step forward. He believes that much of the difficulty in creating a holographic set has now been overcome. \"It took us a while to make that first breakthrough, but as soon as you have the first element of it working the rest often comes more rapidly,\" he said. \"What we are doing now is trying to make the model better. What we showed is just one color, what we are doing now is trying to use three colors. The original display was four inches by four inches and now we're going for something at least as big as a computer screen.\" There are no more great barriers to overcome now, he said. The breakthrough has made some long-time researchers of the technology believe that it could now come to fruition. Tung H. Jeong, a retired physics professor at Lake Forest College outside Chicago who had studied holography since the 1960s told NJ.com; \"When we start talking about erasable and rewritable holograms, we are moving toward the possibility of holographic TV ... It has now been shown that physically, it's possible.\" And what might these holographic televisions look like? According to Peyghambarian, they could be constructed as a screen on the wall (like flat panel displays) that shows 3-D images, with all the image writing lasers behind the wall; or it could be like a horizontal panel on a table with holographic writing apparatus underneath. So, if this project is realized, you really could have a football match on your coffee table, or horror-movie villains jumping out of your wall. Peyghambarian is also optimistic that the technology could reach the market within five to ten years. He said progress towards a final product should be made much more quickly now that a rewriting method had been found. However, it is fair to say not everyone is as positive about this prospect as Peyghambarian. Justin Lawrence, a lecturer in Electronic Engineering at Bangor University in Wales, told CNN that small steps are being made on technology like 3-D holograms, but, he can't see it being ready for the market in the next ten years. \"It's one thing to demonstrate something in a lab but it's another thing to be able to produce it cheaply and efficiently enough to distribute it to the mass market,\" Lawrence said. Yet, there are reasons to be optimistic that more resources will be channeled into developing this technology more quickly. The Japanese Government is pushing huge financial and technical weight into the development of three-dimensional, virtual-reality television, and the country's Communications Ministry is aiming at having such technology available by 2020. Peyghambarian said there are no major sponsors of the technology at present, but as the breakthroughs continued, he hopes that will change. Even if no major electronics company commit themselves, there is hope that backers could come from outside of the consumer electronics industry, he said. \"It could have some other applications. In training it's useful to show people three-dimensional displays. Also it would be good to show things in 3-D for defense command and control and for surgery,\" he said.", "2316db24be5862d953aecc6307a9ab2daadb5124": "Editor's note: Bryan Batt, who plays the closeted art director Salvatore Romano in the Emmy award-winning cable TV series \"Mad Men,\" has acted in nine Broadway and nine Off-Broadway productions, such as \"Sunset Boulevard,\" \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Jeffrey\" and \"Starlight Express.\" Batt, who is 45, has been acting for 23 years.

The deal to buy Bear Stearns is worth an estimated $236 million. The deal values Bear Stearns at $236 million, or just $2 a share. Shares had closed at $30 on Friday, down 47 percent that day. \"Effective immediately, JPMorgan Chase is guaranteeing the trading obligations of Bear Stearns and its subsidiaries and is providing management oversight for its operations,\" said a statement released Sunday by JPMorgan. Shareholders must approve the deal, which is expected to close by the end of June. JPMorgan is taking immediate responsibility for Bear's trading obligations and assuming \"management oversight\" of the firm's operations. The deal has already been approved by the Federal Reserve and other regulators, according to the statement. The Fed is providing special emergency financing for up to $30 billion in Bear Stearns assets. \"JPMorgan stands behind Bear Stearns,\" said Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan. \"Bear Stearns clients and counterparties should feel secure that JPMorgan is guaranteeing ... risk,\" he continued. The fast-track deal is expected to close by the end of June, the statement said. Bear Stearns was on the brink of financial collapse Friday when JPMorgan and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said they would provide the brokerage a short-term loan. Bear was dealing with a classic \"run on the bank.\" The firm's short-term creditors refused to lend the firm any more money and simultaneously demanded repayment of outstanding debt. The one-two punch overwhelmed Bear's cash position. With the global credit crisis worsening, the Fed -- along with officials from the Treasury Department and other government agencies -- took the dramatic action to prevent the investment bank from going under and igniting widespread panic through the financial markets.  Watch a discussion on the impact on global markets \u00bb . Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Sunday that talks about how to rescue Bear had continued throughout the weekend. He defended the Fed's bailout on Friday as \"the right decision\" and said the Bush administration was ready to take other actions to bring stability to the financial markets. He would not say what might have happened had the government failed to step in. \"I'm not going to speculate about what-ifs,\" he said. \"I'm just going to say our clear priority right now -- our number one priority, everything we're doing in the economic arena -- is to minimize instability, minimize spillover into the real economy.\" Bear Stearns has approximately 14,000 employees worldwide. The deal marks an inglorious chapter for 85-year-old Bear Stearns, a storied Wall Street firm the unraveling of which has been fast and furious. Rumors that Bear Stearns was on the verge of collapse started buzzing around Wall Street trading desks last Monday. Chief Executive Alan Schwartz -- who took over as CEO in early January from longtime chief Jimmy Cayne -- appeared on television on Wednesday afternoon to reassure the markets that the firm was stable. But by Thursday night, Bear was in a severe crunch. Some firms that trade with it effectively stopped offering it credit because they feared that Bear was running short of short-term funding, or liquidity. \"The past week has been an incredibly difficult time for Bear Stearns,\" said Alan Schwartz, president and CEO of Bear Stearns. \"This transaction represents the best outcome for all of our constituencies based upon the current circumstances.\" White House spokesman Tony Fratto told CNN on Sunday that Paulson has briefed U.S. President George W. Bush on the Federal Reserve's role in helping to facilitate the purchase. \"We appreciate the actions taken by the Federal Reserve this evening,\" said Fratto. \"Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke are actively engaged in addressing issues affecting our financial markets. Secretary Paulson has kept the President briefed on recent developments.\" Shares of Bear Stearns opened last week at $69.75 and traded as high as $159 last year.

Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is under investigation for the firing of her public safety commissioner. \"Gov. Palin knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates in order to advance a personal agenda,\" the report states. Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan's refusal to fire State Trooper Mike Wooten from the state police force was \"likely a contributing factor\" to Monegan's July dismissal, but Palin had the authority as governor to fire him, the report by former Anchorage prosecutor Stephen Branchflower states. The investigator's report states Palin's efforts to get Wooten fired broke a state ethics law that bars public officials from pursuing personal interest through official action.  Watch what led to investigation \u00bb . The lawyers representing both Sarah and Todd Palin issued a three-page attack on the investigative report, including the contention that Ethics Act violations can only involve financial motives and financial \"potential gain, or the avoidance of a potential loss.\" \"Here, there is no accusation, no finding and no facts that money or financial gain to the Governor was involved in the decision to replace Monegan,\" the lawyers said. Any abuse of power, they said, was on the part of the Legislative Council members, not the Palins. \"Sen. French and Sen. Green may have abused their government power by using public money to pursue a personal vendetta against the Governor, and then agreeing to pursue the PSEA attack against an administration that would not cave in to outrageous union demands.\" \"Put bluntly, Branchflower completely misapplied the Ethics Act and has instead sought to create a headline to smear the Governor,\" the lawyers wrote. Monegan has said he was fired in July after refusing pressure to sack Wooten, who had gone through an acrimonious divorce and custody battle with Palin's sister.  View a timeline of the investigation \u00bb . Monegan said he was \"relieved\" by the findings. \"I believed and had the opinion that I was terminated because I did not fire Wooten,\" he told CNN. \"Now these findings say that that's what happened, so I feel relieved.\" Palin and her husband, Todd, have consistently denied wrongdoing, describing Wooten as a \"rogue trooper\" who had threatened their family -- allegations Branchflower discounted. \"I conclude that such claims of fear were not bona fide and were offered to provide cover for the Palins' real motivation: to get Trooper Wooten fired for personal family reasons,\" Branchflower wrote. The Branchflower report states Todd Palin used his wife's office and its resources to press for Wooten's removal, and the governor \"failed to act\" to stop it. But because Todd Palin is not a state employee, the report makes no finding regarding his conduct. The bipartisan Legislative Council, which commissioned the investigation after Monegan was fired, unanimously adopted the 263-page public report after a marathon executive session Friday. About 1,000 more pages of documents compiled during the inquiry will remain confidential because they involve private personnel matters, according to the council's chairman, state Sen. Kim Elton. \"I believe that these findings may help people come to a conclusion on how they should vote\" in the presidential election, Elton said. McCain-Palin campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said Palin would cooperate with the Personnel Board investigation. The Palins' lawyer has said an investigator named by that board wants to question them in late October. Stapleton called the investigation \"a partisan-led inquiry\" run by supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama, but hailed its finding that Monegan's firing broke no law. \"Gov. Palin was cleared of the allegation of an improper firing, which is what this investigation was approved to look into,\" she said. Stapleton went on to say that the Legislature exceeded its mandate in finding an ethics violation. \"Lacking evidence to support the original Monegan allegation, the Legislative Council seriously overreached, making a tortured argument to find fault without basis in law or fact.\" Rep. John Coghill, a Republican who criticized the handling of the investigation, said it was \"well-done professionally.\" He said Palin \"bumped right against the edges\" of the state's ethics laws but that he would give \"the benefit of the doubt to the governor, though, at this point.\" Palin originally agreed to cooperate with the Legislative Council inquiry, and disclosed in August that her advisers had contacted Department of Public Safety officials nearly two dozen times regarding her ex-brother-in-law. But once she became Sen. John McCain's running mate, her advisers began painting the investigation as a weapon of Democratic partisans. Ahead of Friday's hearing, Palin supporters wearing clown costumes and carrying balloons denounced the probe as a \"kangaroo court\" and a \"three-ring circus\" led by supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. The state senator managing the probe, Sen. Hollis French, fueled those complaints with a September 2 interview in which he warned the inquiry could yield an \"October Surprise\" for the GOP. But Palin's lawyers already had begun pushing for the state Personnel Board to launch its own investigation, calling it the proper legal venue for the matter. \"The report speaks for itself,\" French told CNN Friday night.

Vettel ran into the back of Webber when they were racing behind Hamilton. The FIA ruled that Hamilton would suffer no penalty after inquiring into the accident when Sebastian Vettel crashed into Mark Webber in Fuji. Vettel's original 10-place penalty on the Chinese Grand Prix starting grid was replaced with a reprimand. The stewards studied film of the incident, including amateur video footage, before announcing their verdict. They said: \"Having heard the explanation of all concerned and viewed both the original film of the incident which was available to stewards at Fuji as well as the new film, what has become apparent is the view clearly expressed by all drivers and team managers alike that the conditions at Fuji were exceptionally bad and worse than those experienced when the race starts behind the safety car. \"Because of those views, the stewards accept that it may be inappropriate to impose the penalty normally applied for an offence such as this. \"In the circumstances the stewards will reduce the penalty imposed on Vettel to a reprimand. \"The involvement of Lewis Hamilton in this incident has also been considered in the light of evidence given by him, his team manager and in particular all other parties present and no penalty is imposed upon him.\" The 22-year-old British rookie, who drives for McLaren-Mercedes, leads the race for the world championship by 12 points, with two rounds left, and there had been speculation that he might lose some of those points if the FIA found him culpable. Hamilton had strengthened his title bid with a superb victory at Fuji in appalling conditions which twice saw the safety car deployed. As the field trailed behind the safety car on the second occasion, Toro Rosso's Sebastien Vettel drove into the back of Red Bull's Mark Webber, causing them both to retire. The drivers, who were lying in second and third places behind Hamilton a the time of the accident, both criticized Hamilton for driving erratically and slowing up and down. The incident was missed by television cameras but footage, taken from the grandstand, was shown on the YouTube Web site. It appeared to show Hamilton pulling over to the right-hand side of the track and slowing down markedly, in turn forcing Webber to slow down, which caught Vettel on the hop. Webber said: \"It definitely contributed to Sebastian hitting me up the back because he (Hamilton) wasn't doing what he was supposed to be doing, clearly. \"He spoke in the drivers' meeting about how good a job he was going to do and he did the opposite. Still, we know for next time,\" added the Australian. Webber stressed, however, that he had not complained to the stewards about the incident. On Friday he issued a statement saying: \" I would just like to make it clear that, although I criticized Hamilton's driving in yesterday's FIA Press Conference, at no time have I made any official complaint about anyone's driving following Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix.\" Hamilton, speaking at practice for the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai, had protested his innocence before the verdict was announced. \"I had a good weekend, I didn't put a foot wrong. I didn't do anything to put anyone else in danger,\" he said. \"I've come away to China and all of a sudden I'm going to be punished for something. \"I just think it's a real shame for the sport. Formula One's supposed to be about hard, fair competition. That's what I've tried to do this year, just be fair. \"There's been some real strange situations this year where I'm made to look the bad person and, by the looks of it, this weekend be given a penalty. \"If this is the way it's going to keep going, it's not somewhere I really want to be.\" E-mail to a friend .", "2fed461ab73a1efc76de55c7bdb5d6a43e196114": "(CNN) -- Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari has won the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced Friday.

Barack Obama's reference to \"lipstick on a pig\" has Republicans demanding an apology and Democrats accusing Sen. John McCain of a \"pathetic attempt\" to play the gender card. Barack Obama used the \"lipstick\" line at a campaign event in Lebanon, Virginia, on Tuesday. McCain's campaign said Obama's remarks were offensive and a slap at Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin -- despite the fact that the Arizona senator himself used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of Hillary Clinton's. Obama shot back Wednesday and accused the McCain campaign of engaging in \"lies\" and \"swift boat politics.\" \"I don't care what they say about me. But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics,\" he said in Norfolk, Virginia. \"Enough is enough.\"  Watch Obama deliver his harsh words \u00bb . The phrase \"swift boat\" comes from the 2004 presidential election, when the group \"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\" launched an attack ad campaign against Democratic candidate John Kerry. Read more about what Obama said . Obama made his controversial \"lipstick\" remarks at a Virginia campaign stop late Tuesday afternoon.   Watch what happens with politics and lipstick collide \u00bb . \"John McCain says he's about change too, and so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out George Bush -- except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy and Karl Rove-style politics -- we're really going to shake things up in Washington,'\" he said. \"That's not change. That's just calling something the same thing something different. You know you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. You know you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it's still going to stink after eight years. We've had enough of the same old thing.\"  Watch how tensions are rising on the trail \u00bb . The crowd erupted in applause when Obama delivered the line. The Illinois senator then praised both McCain's \"compelling story\" and Palin's \"interesting story,\" and said his \"hat goes off\" to anyone who's looking after five kids -- \"I've got two and they tire Michelle and me out. ... \"That's why John McCain's campaign manager [Rick Davis] said this campaign isn't going to be about issues, this campaign is going to be about personalities.\" Within minutes, the McCain campaign announced a conference call focused on the remark, which they said was a deliberate reference to Palin's line: \"You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick.\" Palin used the line in the opening remarks of her convention speech, and she frequently uses it on the campaign trail. In Iowa last October, McCain drew comparisons between Hillary Clinton's current health care plan and the one she championed in 1993: \"I think they put some lipstick on the pig, but it's still a pig.\" He used roughly the same line in May, after effectively claiming the Republican nomination. McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told CNN the campaign saw a \"big difference\" between the two references: \"McCain was referring to a policy proposal. Obama was referring to [Alaska] Gov. Sarah Palin. It's obviously disrespectful and offensive. ... \"Who has been talking about lipstick lately? It was obvious. The crowd went crazy because of it.\" It wasn't the first time Obama used the line. In a phone interview with The Washington Post last September, he used it in reference to the situation in Iraq. \"I think that both Gen. [David] Petraeus and Ambassador [Ryan] Crocker are capable people who have been given an impossible assignment,\" Obama told the Post. \"George Bush has given a mission to Gen. Petraeus, and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig.\" Other politicians have also used the phrase in recent years, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Rep. John Mica of Florida and Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado, among others. Torie Clarke, a former McCain adviser, even wrote a book called, \"Lipstick on a Pig: Winning In the No-Spin Era by Someone Who Knows the Game.\" Still, the McCain campaign says Obama's use was intentional, and they want an apology. \"Barack Obama's comments today are offensive and disgraceful. He owes Gov. Palin an apology,\" said Maria Comella, a McCain-Palin spokeswoman. Obama's campaign said \"enough is enough\" and accused McCain of running a \"dishonorable campaign.\" \"The McCain campaign's attack tonight is a pathetic attempt to play the gender card about the use of a common analogy -- the same analogy that Sen. McCain himself used about Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care plan just last year,\" said Obama campaign senior adviser Anita Dunn. \"This phony lecture on gender sensitivity is the height of cynicism and lays bare the increasingly dishonorable campaign John McCain has chosen to run.\" McCain ally Mike Huckabee took Obama's side on the issue, saying he didn't think it was a swipe at Palin. \"It's an old expression, and I'm going to have to cut Obama some slack on that one. I do not think he was referring to Sarah Palin; he didn't reference her. If you take the two sound bites together, it may sound like it,\" he said on Fox's \"Hannity and Colmes.\" \"But I've been a guy at the podium many times, and you say something that's maybe a part of an old joke and then somebody ties it in. So, I'm going to have to cut him slack.\" But McCain's campaign is not about to let the issue go. They released a Web ad Wednesday that plays Obama's lipstick comments, then asks, \"Ready to lead?

He spoke with Kiran Chetry of CNN's \"American Morning\" on Tuesday about how he thinks there are better ways to solve the financial problems plaguing the U.S. economy. Lou Dobbs: Americans \"don't want to hear this nonsense about $700 billion to bail out financial institutions.\" Kiran Chetry, CNN anchor: CNN's Lou Dobbs joins us this morning from Suffolk, New Jersey. You expressed delight I guess you could say, at the fact that it did go down yesterday in defeat. We saw the largest point-drop on Wall Street ever. What happens now? Lou Dobbs, CNN host of \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\": Well, what happens now is that it sounds like the same fools who brought you this effort are going to try again. Henry Paulson saying he's going to come right back, suggests he's not learning. And he's not paying attention to the Congress. These Congress people are all at home in their home districts, nearly every one of them and they're hearing an earful. The American people don't want to hear this nonsense about $700 billion to bail out financial institutions. Frankly, Kiran, they don't need it. Economist after economist, with whom I've spoken, CEOs, they acknowledge that there are far better ways to deal with the issues confronting our financial system than this bailout. And it's absolutely obscenely irresponsible of House Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi, Treasury Secretary [Henry] Paulson, President Bush, Sen. Harry Reid, the leader of the Senate; for these people to be clucking about like hysterical -- so hysterically. It really must stop. And to hear there -- go ahead. Chetry: I was just going to ask you -- . Dobbs: Go ahead. Chetry: You say that there's other ways around this. One of the things that everyone keeps talking about is the fact that credit markets are frozen and there has to be some way to free that up so that everyday business from Wall Street to Main Street can continue. Do you buy that? Dobbs: No, not at all. And neither do most of the CEOs and economists with whom I'm speaking certainly. The real issue, they say, is liquidity. The Fed has injected more than half a billion dollars in liquidity into this banking system.  Watch Lou Dobbs and economists discuss bailout effort \u00bb . What we are watching are business -- quote, unquote -- leaders who won't surface and put their faces before the American public who are hysterical. Absolutely hysterical. These are not leaders of moment. They are not leaders of great character or vision. Only Warren Buffett has had the courage to step forward. And that's after he puts $5 billion into Goldman Sachs. To watch our political leaders, they have no idea in the world, Kiran, what they're doing. Literally. And the arrogance with which this administration asks for, not only money, almost $1 trillion, and surely more in the months ahead. But the absolute power for Treasury Secretary Paulson. Give me a break. The American people want this stopped. Those Congressmen and women at home right now, in their districts, are getting an earful because this is an absurdity and it has to end. Chetry: So in one way, you're knocking Congress. But on the other way you're saying that, I guess the system works in that the brakes were pulled. Whether or not you agree with the reasons why it didn't go through. So, weren't they doing their job and showing leadership? Dobbs: Let me be clear, Kiran. I'm saying leadership -- I'm saying the Democratic leadership of this Congress was absolutely in the same situation as this president. They don't know what they're talking about. They're trying to ram this thing down the people's throats and Congress. And those House Republicans and House Democrats who voted against this bailout deserve a great, great expression of thanks from the American people. Absolutely. Chetry: What do you think if you were up there making decisions? What do you think we need to do? Dobbs: Well, the first thing we need to do is return to a traditional role of regulation. ... The problem here is not simply the housing market. ... But $700 billion and nothing in that bill deals with the foreclosure crisis, if you can imagine that. That's arrogance. That's stupidity. That is your leadership in Washington, D.C. Democratic leadership in Congress and Republican leadership in the White House. So that's an absurdity. The first thing that has to be dealt with is mitigating the foreclosure crisis, period. Secondly, in terms of instilling confidence in the banking system and in our credit markets, the first thing to do is to deal with those institutions that are wildly out of balance, whose balance sheets, frankly, are a joke. And the regulators who should have been tending to them over the years are also a joke. It's time to end the joke. That means aggressive regulation. It means aggressive intervention on an institution-by-institution basis. Chetry: All right. Well, they're going to take this up again today, or throughout the week as they try to figure out what the best course of action is. Maybe they should listen to you a little bit more. Dobbs: They'll be back Thursday. Chetry: Right. Dobbs: They'll be back Thursday to try this nonsense all over again, Kiran.", "f66239cd6a6a7a2fa659e4f3051a8b33c731d759": "(LifeWire) -- After his father was diagnosed with dementia in 1996, Anthony Lazzara Jr. faced a difficult decision: He and his wife, Gail, either could place his father, Anthony Lazzara Sr., in a facility, or they could care for him themselves. Anthony Lazzara Jr. (right) and his wife, Gail (left), cared for Anthony Lazzara Sr. at home for eight years. Unable to afford a care facility, the Lazzaras brought him home. So began eight long years of caring for the World War II veteran and onetime truck driver as he slowly declined -- a burden borne largely by Gail, 56. She fed him, bathed him and changed his diapers on a daily basis while her husband, a truck driver, was on the road. Slowly, she says, her marriage began to crumble. \"I couldn't take my frustration out on my father-in-law,\" she says. Instead, she took it out on her husband. \"We almost ended up divorcing over the whole deal,\" says Anthony Jr., 56. Gail concedes she considered leaving, \"but I couldn't walk away from my father-in-law.\" Two years ago, the Lazzaras finally threw in the towel. A bed became available at a local Veterans Affairs facility, and the elder Lazzara was admitted. He remained there until April 2008, when he died at age 95. A difficult labor of love . As the Lazzaras can attest, the stress of caring for an elderly parent can overwhelm a relationship. Chauffeuring loved ones to appointments, handling their shopping, assuming their financial burden, even just living under the same roof can test even the most committed couples. In 2004, the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP reported that over 44 million Americans care for an adult family member or friend. Almost 80 percent of these are caring for someone older than 50. Although caring for a parent in their twilight years can be rewarding, it can also be a trial, says Beth Witrogen, the Pulitzer Prize-nominated author of \"Caregiving: The Spiritual Journey of Love, Loss and Renewal.\" \"Caregiving brings out the best and worst in us all,\" she says. Al Levi, 39, a Brooklyn, New York, occupational therapist, has experienced that kind of strain in his marriage. Levi says he has been at odds with his wife since his father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's two years ago. \"I felt like my wife wasn't taking this seriously enough, and that if it would have been her parents, it would have been more important,\" he says. For a while, the Levis cared for Al's father at home, but eventually it got to be more than they could handle. Levi placed his father in a nursing home this past summer. But he says the ordeal has continued to strain his marriage. \"It's complicated,\" he says. 'Your best is good enough' Often, couples will harbor unreasonable expectations of what they can or should do -- together or individually -- to care for an aging parent. \"You have to accept that your best is good enough,\" Witrogen says. \"It may not be pretty, but you will get the job done.\" It's also crucial that couples communicate clearly and effectively, Witrogen says. Too often, one partner will fixate on solving the problem while neglecting to listen to the other's needs. In the Lazzaras' case, Anthony Jr. says he would search for care facilities for his father from time to time, but Gail was still left to shoulder most of the daily duties of care -- something her husband still feels guilty about. With their three children grown, \"it was her time to have and here she was taking care of my dad,\" Anthony Jr. laments. It wasn't until the Lazzaras finally found room for Anthony Sr. at the VA facility that they finally found some relief. \"We knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel,\" Anthony Jr. says. Balancing your needs . Although finding a balance between caring for an aging parent and maintaining a healthy marriage can be tremendously challenging, it can be done, experts say. Part of that solution is ensuring the aging parent gets proper care, says Leah Siskin, senior psychologist at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, New York. \"When the psychological needs of the care recipient are addressed, this can no doubt have a positive effect on the marital relationship of the caregivers,\" she says. It's also important that couples care for one another. Giuseppe Manca, a 58-year-old holistic healer in Manhattan, grew frustrated that he couldn't take a vacation with his wife for fear of leaving his live-in mother-in-law alone, even though she was in good health. So the couple decided to take weekend trips, making sure neighbors and loved ones were on standby in case of an emergency. The Lazzaras didn't have the luxury of traveling while Anthony Sr. was still alive. Although they say their marriage has stabilized since his passing -- Gail has been able to devote more time to her job coordinating a local volleyball league -- they admit that it could have crumbled. \"We nearly crashed and burned,\" Anthony Jr. says. How to cope . Author Witrogen offers the following tips for coping when a couple's \"for better or worse\" turns to the latter in caring for an elderly parent: . \u2022 Talk it out. Bring in a third party such as an attorney to provide objective perspective. Those short on money can invite clergy or a neighbor. \u2022 Make time for yourself -- and each other. It takes willingness, intention and time management, Witrogen says. \"Get out your day planners and schedule the time in. I suggest that couples schedule 'play dates,' even if for an hour.\" \u2022 Don't neglect your health.

One of her brothers tries to console her. \"You're going to come back,\" he says. Julie Quiroz, a 13-year-old U.S. citizen, went back to Mexico when her mom was deported. The 13-year-old Quiroz begins to walk away to catch an airplane from Mexico to the United States. Within moments, she rushes back to her mother's arms. \"Mommy,\" she says again, tears streaming down her face. Quiroz is one of an estimated 3 million American children who have at least one parent who entered the United States illegally, according to the Urban Institute, which researches and evaluates U.S. social and economic issues. In Quiroz's case, she was born in Washington state, lived there her entire life and went to school there. But her mother, Ana Reyes, entered the United States illegally before Quiroz was born and U.S. immigration officials caught up with her last year on her birthday.  Watch how deportation separates family \u00bb . \"I was there when they handcuffed her,\" Quiroz says. \"I was there when they took her down.\" Two of her brothers, who had come with their mother to the United States when they were young children, also were taken into custody. It was the start of a downward spiral for Quiroz. When her mother and brothers were deported, Quiroz and her 6-year-old, American-born sister had no choice but to return to Mexico City with them. Her seventh-grade year was spent in a classroom where she didn't understand the language. \"I never belonged there,\" she says. \"I'd just come home, sit down, cry. I'd say, 'Mom, I can't do it.' ... I can't read or write Spanish.\" She adds, \"I felt like there were no dreams for me.\" Stories like these are becoming more common, immigration analysts say, with American children caught in the middle of their mother or father's illegal status. A report last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association said these children face \"increasing risk of family separation, economic hardship and psychological trauma.\" \"It's really hard to imagine something that can be more traumatic than to be forcibly separated from their caregiver. That's the enforcement climate that we're operating in now,\" says Miriam Calderon, the associate director for education and children's policy at the National Council of La Raza, the largest Hispanic advocacy group in the United States. Calderon says the nation needs to enforce immigration laws, but currently there is a lack of a \"consistent and comprehensive standard to ensure that children will be protected\" when undocumented parents are taken into custody. \"Until a major immigration reform is enacted, the country will continue to cope with challenges resulting from the presence of roughly 12 million undocumented immigrants in our workforce and in our communities,\" said Janet Murguia, the president of NCLR, before Congress in May. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says it's simply enforcing the laws on the books. \"ICE agents and officers are sworn to uphold all of our nation's immigration and customs laws,\" ICE press secretary Kelly Nantel said in a written statement. \"We cannot pick and choose the laws we enforce. Parents make decisions that affect their families everyday. \"There are known consequences for violating our nation's immigration laws. It's unfortunate that parents choose to place their children in these difficult situations.\" For Quiroz, her journey from America to Mexico City took an unexpected turn when her plight caught the attention of Joe Kennard, a land developer and Christian philanthropist. Kennard reached out to Quiroz's mother and told her the teen could live with his family in Texas and enroll in school there. \"You can make all the arguments that [the mother] deserved what she got because she was an adult, she made the choice, she was here illegally,\" Kennard says. \"But why [punish] the children? They're innocent and they're born here and they're U.S. citizens.\" His group, Organization to Help Citizen Children, works with churches along the U.S.-Mexico border to provide support for children whose mother or father is deported to Mexico. Kennard hired a private tutor to get Quiroz up to speed for missing a year of schooling. \"She's conflicted because she knows that she's got to get an education and this is the only way to do it. But she also feels the love for her mother and that's the torture.\" Quiroz's mother then made the incredibly painful decision to implore her daughter to go to Texas, an unbearable decision for the teen to leave her family for her country and her future. Her older brother, Carlos Quiroz, was about 3 years old when his mom took him to the United States last decade. He misses his sister, but knows he can't return. \"I have to accept that ... and try to make it work,\" he says.  Watch why Carlos Quiroz feels like an American \u00bb . He's working to get a job and hopes to enter college in Mexico. But his mind is still in the land he grew up in. \"I don't feel like I belong here. I feel like I was taken out of somewhere where I belonged,\" he says. \"My whole life is over there.\" His sister is now living in Texas, adjusting to eighth grade and all the changes around her. When she's alone, she says it still hurts. \"I want to be in my mom's arms,\" she says, choking back tears. The dream that keeps her going? She's determined to become a lawyer to fight for kids who are forced to endure painful separations. \"My mom only came here to make a better life,\" she says. \"I want to be a lawyer to help people in the same situation as me.\" CNN's Gregg Canes and Traci Tamura contributed to this report.", "4539ab5e3b32ff4eb25267a56368d567051d5478": "(AOL Autos)  -- Have you ever wondered what your neighbors are carrying around in their car's trunk or SUV's cargo hold? I decided to find out -- by asking 100 strangers in a department store parking lot. Strollers, playpens, toys and diapers take up a lot of space, but a lot of parents still had organized trunks. The mission . To uncover the secret contents of the average American trunk and cargo hold. The stakeout . I spent two weekend afternoons at the Empire Center in Burbank, California, with my camera and notebook, approaching shoppers as they arrived or departed. I identified myself as a reporter for AOL Autos, and asked if I could see what they had in their trunk, and maybe take a picture. I hoped that I'd be able to see a trend in trunks. AOL Autos: Small cars with room in the trunk . The raw data  My decidedly unscientific study yielded some interesting results. First of all, I discovered that even in a big city (Burbank is a suburb of Los Angeles), people are exceedingly nice if you are respectful and forthright. About 80% of the people I approached were kind, open and helpful, and gladly opened their trunks for a glance. The 20% who refused were either in a rush, guarded or shy -- but they were still remarkably polite. The second surprising thing was that the vast majority of trunks and cargo holds were clean and uncluttered. I really expected to discover overstuffed trunks, full of cast-off items and flea market finds. But even the most fully-used storage areas were tidy and organized. AOL Autos: Used fuel-efficient crossovers . Not surprisingly, people with small children tended to have the most crowded trunks and cargo holds. Strollers, playpens, toys and diapers take up a lot of space, but most families have discovered that clean, organized trunks make getting to your kids' supplies much easier and more efficient. AOL Autos: Best new cars for 2009 . Another trend I noticed was that athletic folks tend to use their car's trunk as a portable gym locker. I saw a lot of gym bags, sports equipment and sneakers. On a hot day, this was a bit of a mixed blessing; baked sneakers have a decidedly pungent odor. No one seemed to have a good solution to this problem. I would put a cabin air freshener, like the Little Tree, in my trunk if I regularly carried my tennis shoes. AOL Autos: Celebrity cars you can afford . For the non-athletic, the most common item I saw was the collapsible chair. One family had an entire beach setup in their trunk: four collapsible chairs, a beach blanket, a sun umbrella and an empty cooler, all neatly tucked against the back wall. They said that they always wanted to be ready for a beach day, should the opportunity arise. Some people were extremely proud of their trunks. One woman bragged that her brother taught her how to organize her tools, and that she had taken the organization to the next level. She had multiple storage boxes in her neat, clean trunk, each with a different set of useful items. AOL Autos: Most fun cars for under $20,000 . A few families were downright sheepish about the state of their cargo holds. They apologized in advance before opening the trunk, and said that they were in the middle of a project that had foiled their attempts at organization and cleanliness. I have to take them at their word; I'm not making a return trip to that hot parking lot to follow up. The conclusion . After two days pounding the asphalt, I'm pleased to report that I actually uncovered some useful information and some fun trivia. There are good reasons for keeping your trunk as empty as possible: . 1. Less junk in the trunk equals less weight, and less weight can mean greater fuel efficiency.   2. Under certain circumstances, shifting content in your trunk can adversely affect handling.   3. An empty trunk provides space for that roadside find or warehouse store bargain. How else are you going to get that pallet of pickled asparagus spears back to your garage? Here are a few tips that I picked up from the best (and worst) of trunks: . 1. Use boxes or containers in your trunk to keep your emergency kit organized and all together. 2. Purge non-essential items from your trunk on a regular basis. 3. Vacuum your cargo space whenever you wash your car so that whatever you put in your trunk doesn't get dirty and dusty. 4. Keep a few reusable shopping bags in your trunk so that you always have them when you get to the store. 5. Be sure to carry a few essential tools -- screwdrivers, wrench, tire-changing tools, a rubber mallet, etc. -- for emergency repair. 6. A cargo net or bungee cords will help keep your boxes and other items from rolling around in the trunk during hard cornering. Last, but not least, here's a list of the oddest items that I saw in any trunk: . \u2022. A machete, an axe and a hammer, wrapped in a colorful sheet (I didn't ask any questions). \u2022 A pair of old-school quad roller skates. \u2022 An ice scraper (odd because the temperature was 97 degrees in the shade) -- and we never get frost in Southern California. \u2022 A tube of Butt Paste -- a highly useful concoction that combats diaper rash. \u2022 Nothing.

A Black Man's View of America.\" Please visit his Web site. Roland Martin says Americans need to rise above issues of race, age and gender when they vote. (CNN) -- One of the most intriguing conversations I had at either the Democratic or Republican convention was with a white labor leader from Ohio. I can't remember his name, but he made it clear that he is going all around the Rust Belt state looking his white union brothers and sisters in the eye and essentially shaming them into supporting Sen. Barack Obama for president. No, he's not saying vote for the black man for president because he's black. He said he's telling them that it's shameful that as Democrats, they agree with him on various political issues, but because of his skin color, they are refusing to cast ballots for him. \"We have gone to our black brothers and sisters for years to support our [white] candidates, and it's wrong for us to stand here and not support one of their own, even though we're Democrats,\" he barked. There is nothing more in-your-face than to hear someone speak truthfully to the inherent racism that is at play in this election. For all the talk about inclusion and the historic nature of this campaign, the true tribal feelings of so many people will come into play, whether we want to admit it or not. We are seeing remarkable bias playing strongly in this election. Exit-polling data in the primaries showed some evidence of bias when it came to age, race and gender, but the great concern is whether people are as honest in talking to pollsters as they are in the voting booth. Because Sen. John McCain is 72 and would be the oldest person to be sworn in as president, there is a lot of dialogue about how old this white guy is, and how wrong it is that he's running. Age questions also have been raised about the 47-year-old black guy from Chicago and whether he is too young and inexperienced to lead. While there is a lot of talk and excitement surrounding Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin being named as the first woman on a Republican ticket, and what that may mean in terms of widespread female support coming the way of McCain-Palin, there are some voices who refuse to vote for a woman. We've also seen a number of prominent women -- including Washington Post columnist Sally Quinn and radio talk show host Dr. Laura Schlessinger -- who have questioned whether the 44-year-old white mother of five children should be vice president, considering she has five children, including a special needs child. It's wonderful to talk about the economy, immigration, the war in Iraq, health care and education, but we can't be na\u00efve to the reality that when voters go into that voting booth, they will, as one person told me during an interview, \"vote with their tribe.\" That was one of the arguments we heard during the Democratic primaries when Obama enjoyed overwhelming support from African-Americans -- to the tune of 90-plus percent -- while Sen. Hillary Clinton had major female support, largely white, in the range of 65 to 70 percent. So what do we do when it comes to our tendency to follow group identification? 1. Stop dancing around the topic. When you watch TV and hear folks talk about Wal-Mart moms or small, rural towns, they are talking about white Americans. These catch phrases never include African-Americans or Hispanics . 2. Confront bias where it is. Ask your friends, neighbors, co-workers and church members who they are voting for. When they give you the \"I really can't put my finger on it\" line, then press them. Hard. You know the real answer, so don't beat around the bush. The best folks to challenge Americans on their hang-ups regarding age, race and gender aren't the AARP, NAACP or NOW. It's Y-O-U. Don't give in to the \"That's the way I was raised\" mantra. When someone suggests that flags and faith show that a candidate isn't one of us, drill down. 3. Accept the fact that some people will not change. We all think that we have been gifted to the degree that our sane and logical arguments can get folks off their biased stumps. Some people just won't give in. Fine, move on. The goal is to rid our society of as much bias as possible. If someone is so hard-headed, then you have to go on to the next person and try to change them. It's critical that we be as honest as possible about the impact of race, age and gender in campaigns. A lot of people love to toss around the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s quote that he hoped one day people would be judged by \"the content of their character.\" But it's still a reality that skin tone, gender and our birth date means more than character to a lot of Americans.

Doctors said Lakshmi was recovering well as she appeared Tuesday at a news conference. Lakshmi, wearing a plaster cast on her legs to keep her feet up and her legs together to help her wounds heal, was carried into a news conference Tuesday as her doctors announced she was being released from intensive care. \"She is coping very well,\" lead surgeon Dr. Sharan Patil said. \"She is being carried around by her mother and her father.\" Several of her doctors, all of them smiling, described her recovery over the past week \"very steady and good progress,\" one saying she is \"out of the woods\" as far as serious medical issues are concerned.  Watch the recovering little girl meet the media \u00bb . The operation a week ago lasted 27 hours and involved a team of some 30 surgeons, all specialists in pediatrics, neurosurgery, orthopedics, and plastic surgery, working in eight-hour shifts. Lakshmi's extra limbs were part of a conjoined twin which stopped developing in the womb. It had a torso and limbs but no head, and was joined to Lakshmi at the pelvis. Doctors said that without the surgery, Lakshmi would have been unlikely to survive beyond early adolescence. The surgery involved the removal of the extra limbs and the repositioning of Lakshmi's organs. When Lakshmi was born into her poor, rural Indian family, villagers in the remote settlement of Rampur Kodar Katti in the northern state of Bihar believed she was sacred. As news of her birth spread, locals queued for a blessing from the baby. Her parents, Shambhu and Poonam Tatma, named the girl after the Hindu goddess of wealth who has four arms. However, they were forced to keep her in hiding after they were approached by men offering money in exchange for putting their daughter in a circus. The couple, who earn just $1 a day as casual laborers, wanted her to have the operation but were unable to pay for the rare procedure, which had never before been performed in India. After Patil visited the girl in her village from Narayana Health City hospital in Bangalore, the hospital's foundation agreed to fund the $200,000 operation. Planning for the surgery took a month, Patil said, and Lakshmi spent that month in the hospital. Many villagers, however, remained opposed to surgery and were planning to erect a temple to Lakshmi, whom they still revere as sacred.

Satellite image taken at 1:15 p.m. Saturday shows Tropical Storm Cristobal off the coast of the Carolinas. At 11 p.m. ET Saturday, the center of the storm was about 45 miles southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina, and about 170 miles southwest of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The National Hurricane Center said Cristobal was moving northeast at about 6 mph, with maximum sustained winds of about 45 mph and some higher gusts. \"The center of the tropical storm is expected to move parallel and very close to the coast of North Carolina for the next day or so,\" the NHC said. It is expected to dump between three and five inches of rain along the Carolina coast this weekend, it said. The storm had not strengthened beyond the 45 mph top winds measured earlier on Saturday, according to the NHC. A discussion posted online by NHC forecasters called Cristobal \"convectively challenged\" and predicted the storm would \"become absorbed ahead of an approaching cold front\" by late Monday. Although the center of the storm was forecast to remain off the coast through the weekend, tropical storm warnings were in effect from the South Santee River in South Carolina to the North Carolina-Virginia state line, including Pamlico Sound. Flood advisories were posted for coastal counties, and Wilmington, North Carolina, received 2\u00bd inches of rain Saturday, said Stephen Keebler, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service there. Cristobal's winds were not expected to be a problem, Keebler said. \"It's some rain and a little bit of relief for the coastal areas and a lot of excitement, but that's about it,\" he said. The rain bands were weakening as they spun farther inland, providing little relief for parched areas near Interstate 95 in North Carolina, he said. Forecasters predicted up to 5 inches of rain along the North Carolina coast, with heavier amounts in some areas. Eastern North Carolina is under a moderate drought, and areas along South Carolina's northern coast are considered abnormally dry, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Officials have blamed the persistent drought for a massive wildfire that has burned more than 40,000 acres in eastern North Carolina since it began June 1 with a lightning strike. As Cristobal lurked offshore, the storm was keeping many boaters off the waters -- and surfers in the waves. On North Carolina's Outer Banks, surfers reveled in the waves as the storm churned offshore well to the south. Bradley Rose, a surf instructor at SandBarz in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, said the waves were a bit choppy. \"It looks pretty fun out there,\" Rose said. At the By the Sea Motel in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, out-of-state vacationers took to the beach, trying to photograph the outer rain bands of Cristobal, hotel manager Charlie Peterson said. Intermittent rain showers during the afternoon were not enough to chase them away, and there were even brief moments of sunshine. \"They've got their cameras set, and they think there is going to be lightning over the water and all,\" he said. \"They have never seen this.\" Elsewhere Saturday, Hurricane Fausto strengthened far off Mexico's Pacific coast, while Hurricane Bertha, located east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, was downgraded to tropical storm status.

As the chancellor of one of the nation's lowest-performing school districts, she says she has no choice -- too much bureaucracy to cut through, too many problems to fix after decades of neglect. Michelle Rhee says a sense of urgency has been missing for years in the District of Columbia's schools. Rhee closed 23 schools in her first year as the head of the District of Columbia's public schools, fired 36 principals and cut 15 percent -- about 121 jobs -- from the central office staff. And she's making no apologies. \"I think it's that sense of urgency that has been lacking for far too long in our public schools,\" Rhee told CNN as she began her second year on the job in late August. \"We are always going to put the best interests of kids above the rights, privileges and priorities of adults.\"  Watch fighting for \"radical changes\" \u00bb . Rhee said \"radical\" changes are needed because only 12 percent of the District's eighth graders are proficient in reading and just 8 percent are proficient in math, but was quick to add that they're already seeing improvement. She highlighted gains in elementary reading and secondary level math and reading in the past year that outstripped all of the four prior years put together. An annual report card by Education Week, a newspaper that follows the nation's education system, earlier this year ranked the District's school system last, giving it a D+ overall and an F for student achievement in kindergarten through 12th grade. Those grades were based on data prior to Rhee's arrival. \"We need to see radical changes because the outcomes for kids that are happening right now are robbing them of their futures,\" said Rhee, a Democrat who supports President Bush's landmark education law known as No Child Left Behind.  Watch Rhee describe telling employee: \"You need to find another job\" \u00bb . \"We have scores of kids in this city who don't have the advocates that they need in their lives who are able to maneuver and jockey through the public school system. And we can't allow those children to languish in classrooms where teachers are not performing.\" Her plan is ambitious: To completely transform the District's system within eight years for its 50,000 children. The plan focuses on top-down accountability, quantitative results like standardized test scores and, ultimately, working to close what she describes as \"the achievement gap between wealthy white kids and poor minority kids.\" \"I think it's absolutely possible within an eight-year period,\" she said.  Watch D.C. schools need \"urgency\" \u00bb . Rhee, who is Korean-American, is operating in a largely African-American district. It is a district where 57 percent of the students qualify for the free or reduced lunch program. Rhee said when she first arrived on the job in 2007 she first heard whispers of: \"She's not from D.C., she's not African-American: Is she going to be able to relate to students and their families?\" \"I think that all dissipated quite quickly after I started getting out into the community and talking to people,\" said Rhee, a 38-year-old mother of two children attending local public schools. \"I think one of the things that comes across very clearly is the fact that I'm very passionate about this work. I'm very focused on it.\" But her plan to turn the failing school district on its head has met protest every step of the way, even from teachers. \"I think the people who view her aggressive actions as a positive thing, I think they are missing the boat because if it results in more chaos and more dysfunction, it's not the solution that we need,\" said Kerry Sylvia, a teacher at Cardozo Senior High School in her ninth year. Sylvia says the District has seen far too many superintendents over the years and fears Rhee is just another in the long list of those who come in touting their reforms and then leave. She does offer praise for Rhee holding teachers and administrators accountable for their lack of performance. However, she doesn't always care for Rhee's style, saying Rhee makes it seem like \"there's a lot of lazy teachers.\" \"She's pitting adults against children. She couches things in terms of 'I'm not here to keep jobs for adults. I'm not here to keep people's paychecks. I am here for the children,' \" Sylvia said. \"Well, guess what? I'm here for the children too.\" Before taking on her current role, Rhee founded The New Teacher Project, a non-profit organization that recruits quality teachers to high-poverty schools. Rhee holds a master's degree in public policy from Harvard University. One of the most controversial programs Rhee has introduced is a joint venture between D.C. schools and Harvard that pays middle school students cash -- up to $100 a month -- for good behavior and attendance. Rhee says such pilot programs have worked in other cities. She says the District's students have far too many bad incentives on the streets, from hustling to drug dealing, and need something to keep them focused. \"We're preparing them to understand that if you do the right thing, then good things will happen to you,\" Rhee said. Some in the District are skeptical, including Clarence Cherry, a fourth-generation Washingtonian and father of five. He calls the cash and Rhee's overall direction misguided and reckless. \"It's a very dangerous game that she's playing with,\" he said. But Cherry added, \"I want to give her an opportunity to prove to me as a parent that she genuinely ... is here for the kids.\" Others are fervent supporters of the new superintendent. Dr. Waheedah Shakoor, another teacher at Cardozo, has been in the District since 1979. He says he's been stunned at the amount of change that's happened in just one year under Rhee, from freshly painted walls to improved athletic facilities. \"Things that we've been asking for for many, many years have come to fruition within just the last 12 months,\" Shakoor said. Rhee is an appointee of Mayor Adrian Fenty, who has backed her every move. \"I had the highest expectations of Michelle Rhee when she came into the job. She has exceeded every expectation,\" Fenty said. \"When you have a system that's been as underperforming as the District of Columbia public schools, you need to shake things up.\" Rhee says she'll continue to shake things, working at break-neck speed to improve the education and opportunity for her students and urban students across the country as fast as she can.", "6f038b2dd4df9e2aed966e0fc91f4f84ab3e0041": "JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israeli police divers found a suitcase Thursday containing human remains that are believed to be the body of a missing 4-year-old girl, an Israeli police spokesman said. French-Israeli girl Rose poses for a photograph with her mother, Marie Pizem. The suitcase was pulled out of the Yarkon River in Tel Aviv, where police have been searching for Rose Pizem, Mickey Rosenfeld said. Two weeks ago, the girl's grandfather Roni Ron, 45, told police he stuffed her body in a suitcase and dumped it in the Yarkon River. The remains will be tested to confirm the identification of the body, and the tests could be completed within 24 hours, Rosenfeld said. \"The body was found in a very bad, severe condition, as you can imagine after being in the water for weeks,\" Rosenfeld said, explaining why the tests could not be completed sooner. Ron initially told police he accidentally killed Rose when he slapped her in a fit of rage but then changed his account. Police transcripts quote Ron as saying, \"I parked the car on the sidewalk. I opened the trunk, pulled out the suitcase and when I reached the banks of the river, I threw it. She's finished. I finished her. I saw the water seeping in and the suitcase slowly sinking.\" The family drama centers on Rose's mother, Marie-Charlotte Renault-Pizam, 23, and Ron -- her estranged husband's father -- with whom authorities say she has had two more daughters. Rose's father lives in France. Both the mother and grandfather are in custody. Renault-Pizam has denied any role in her daughter's disappearance. She told police she thought Ron sent Rose to an institution in France, although police, without elaborating, have said they have a telephone conversation that shows she knew the child's fate. Rose's great-grandmother, Vivienne Yaakov, reported the girl missing in late July, saying she had not seen her great-grandchild for about two months. Rose and her mother had been staying with Yaakov, who told police that Ron had taken the child and she never returned. Police searched Ron's apartment in mid-August and arrested him. The investigation has uncovered a twisted family love triangle that may have contributed to the girl's murder. The British media call the case Israel's Madeleine McCann, a reference to the 3-year-old child who disappeared May 3, 2007, while on vacation with her British family at the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz. She has never been found. Rose was born in France in 2003. Her mother moved to Israel after a custody battle with Rose's father, Benjamin Pizem. Renault-Pizam had fallen in love with Ron on a previous trip to Israel with her father-in-law. Israel's minister of interior security, Avi Dichter, said everything would be done to find Rose and give her a proper burial. \"There is no doubt that as a society, Israel was not there for the child when she was in need of help,\" Dichter said. Benjamin Pizem told Israel's Haaretz newspaper that he still hopes Rose is alive. He described his father, from whom he is estranged, as manipulative and said more details may be uncovered. \"When I see him in videos, I see in his face, even if it's quite a neutral one, he has an expression that says, 'You don't know everything, and I'm manipulating all of you.' That's the reason why we think there's hope Rose is still alive.\"", "9f5a789344f92ea35c2fba5f7bc83ad36ba64973": "BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian President Alvaro Uribe admitted Wednesday that the symbol of the neutral Red Cross organization was used in a hostage rescue mission that freed 15 people from leftist rebels two weeks ago. What seems to be part of a red cross is seen on a bib worn by a man involved in the rescue in this official image. Uribe made the admission after CNN reported on unpublished photographs and videos that clearly showed a man wearing a Red Cross bib. Wrongly using the Red Cross logo is prohibited by the Geneva Conventions. The man was a member of the Colombian military intelligence team involved in the daring rescue, Uribe said in an address carried on national TV and radio. The president said that as the constitutional head of the armed forces, he takes full political responsibility for what he described as a slip-up. \"This officer, upon confessing his mistake to his superiors, said when the [rescue] helicopter was about to land ... he saw so many guerrillas that he went into a state of angst,\" Uribe said. \"He feared for his life and put on the Red Cross bib over his jacket.\" However, the confidential military source who showed CNN the photographs that included the man wearing the bib said they were taken moments before the mission took off. Uribe said he was sorry for the mistake and has apologized to ICRC officials. There will be no official sanction against the man wearing the bib, he indicated. Such a use of the Red Cross emblem could constitute a \"war crime\" under the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law and could endanger humanitarian workers in the future, according to international legal expert Mark Ellis, executive director of the International Bar Association. The ICRC mission in Bogota said in a written statement that it \"noted\" Uribe's announcement. The ICRC mission in Bogota said in a written statement: \"As guardian of international humanitarian law, the ICRC reminds that the use of the Red Cross emblem is specifically regulated by the Geneva Conventions and its additional protocols. \"The Red Cross emblem has to be respected in all circumstances and cannot be used in an abusive manner. \"The ICRC as neutral and impartial must have the confidence of all the sides in the conflict in order to carry out its humanitarian work.\" Colombian military intelligence used the Red Cross emblem in a rescue operation in which leftist guerrillas were duped into handing over 15 hostages, including former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt. Photographs of the Colombian military intelligence-led team that spearheaded the rescue, shown to CNN by a confidential military source, show one man wearing a bib with the Red Cross symbol. The military source said the three photos were taken moments before the mission took off to persuade the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels to release the hostages to a supposed international aid group for transport to another rebel area. Ellis said the conventions were \"very strict\" regarding use of the symbol because of what it represented: impartiality, neutrality. Watch possible misuse of emblem \u00bb . \"If you use the emblem in a deceitful way, generally the conventions say it would be a breach. [Based on the information as explained to me,] the way that the images show the Red Cross emblem being used could be distinguished as a war crime, \" Ellis added. The unpublished video and photos of the mission, hailed internationally as a daring success, were shown to CNN by a military source looking to sell the material. CNN declined to buy the material at the price being asked; it was therefore unable to verify the authenticity of the images. Uribe and his top generals had categorically denied that international humanitarian symbols were used in the July 2 rescue mission that freed the prized hostages. The hostages had endured years of harsh captivity and deprivation in jungle camps since being captured or kidnapped. Some were held for as long as 10 years. The rescue ruse also included bogus communications, sent electronically and by human couriers, to convince FARC rebels that superiors were ordering them to hand over hostages to the group posing as aid workers for transfer to another rebel camp. Misuse of the Red Cross emblem is governed by articles 37, 38 and 85 of Additional Protocol One to the Geneva Conventions, the international rules of war. The articles prohibit \"feigning of protected status by the use of ... emblems\" of neutral parties and say that such misuses are considered breaches of international humanitarian law that qualify as a \"war crime.\" Colombia signed the Geneva Conventions in 1949. That prohibition was put in place to protect the neutrality of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations in an armed conflict and to guarantee their access to all sides. Use of those emblems by one side of a conflict, for example, could endanger aid workers because those on another side might no longer trust that symbols they see really represent those humanitarian organizations. Among the photos shown to CNN are some bearing a date stamp of July 2, taken at an unidentified landing site in the jungle alongside a farm house. In one of those photographs, about 15 members of a Colombian military intelligence-led team pose for a photo alongside a helicopter. One of the members, dressed in a dark red T-shirt or polo shirt, khaki cargo pants and a black-and-white Arab-style scarf, also wears a bib of the type worn by Red Cross workers. The bib bears the Red Cross symbol in the center of two black circles on a white background. In the space between the two black circles appear in capital letters the French words \"Comite International Geneve\" (International Committee Geneva). The same man is standing in the doorway of the helicopter, a Russian-made MI-17 painted white and orange, in another photo. In a third photo, he is pictured walking near the helicopter still wearing the bib. The same man pictured in the photos can be seen fleetingly in a heavily edited video of the rescue mission issued to the media by the Defense Ministry two days after the hostages were freed. In one frame, part of what appears to be the Red Cross bib is visible as the man wearing it stands in a jungle clearing alongside guerrilla commanders Gerardo Antonio Aguilar, alias Cesar, and Alexander Farfan, known as Enrique Gafas, who were captured in the operation. The red blur of a Red Cross can be seen and part of the two black circles of the emblem and the capital letters \"EVE\". Those are also the last three letters of word Geneve (Geneva), which appears on the official ICRC emblem and bib. In two other frames of the officially released video, the same man, dressed in the same clothes as in the pre-departure photos, can be seen still wearing the predominantly white bib tied at the sides. In those shots the ICRC logo is not visible. The unpublished video also reveals an emblem that bears the Spanish words \"Mision Internacional Humanitaria\" (International Humanitarian Mission) and a stylized red bird made up of wavy red lines above two curved branches of blue leaves. In the 3\u00bd-minute video of the operation issued by the military, emblems pasted on the side of the rescue helicopter cannot be seen. But in the unpublished video and photos shown to CNN, emblems measuring about one square meter (one square yard) are pasted onto the outside of the chopper. The same emblem appears on the Web site for Mision Internacional Humanitaria, which describes itself as a non-governmental organization based in Barcelona, Spain, that \"works to improve the processes of development to guarantee equality of opportunity for individuals and peoples.\" Although the site says the group is registered with the Spanish Interior Ministry and the regional Department of Justice, the site is littered with misspellings, and the telephone number that's listed is 000000000. CNN was unable to contact the group to verify its existence. The group's Web site could not be accessed early Tuesday. Additional video clips show how the emblems on the side of the helicopter were stripped off and burned once the rescue mission had been completed. The fate of the bib is not clear from the clips.", "e9d5e34f56b0db410efe86ec509056714c8ea33e": "(Travel + Leisure) -- It's no surprise: Americans are super-opinionated, especially about the cities they live in and the places they visit. In fact, their feelings are so strong that in the 2008 America's Favorite Cities survey -- conducted by travelandleisure.com and CNN Headline News -- Americans voted more than 600,000 times on 45 characteristics of 25 cities, weighing in on things like shopping, food, culture and nightlife, as well as cleanliness and affordability. New Orleans earned No. 1 rankings for fine dining and live music. In 2007, there was a lot of cheering from cities that clinched the No. 1 spots, like Chicago, Illinois, (dining) and Austin, Texas, (best singles scene). But we also saw a lot of upsets -- upset people, that is. After all, someone had to come in last. Unfortunately for the proud people of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, America voted them dead last in the category of attractive people. And Los Angeles, California, took the prize for least friendly city, a category that most expected New York City to sweep. Notable changes . For the winners in each category, 2008 brought some surprises. New Orleans, Louisiana, elbowed New York aside as the best city for fine dining. Las Vegas, Nevada, took the No. 1 spot for best singles scene as former No. 1 Austin tumbled to No. 5. In the cleanliness category, Portland, Oregon, swept Minneapolis, Minnesota, out of first place this year.

Texans sit in bumper-to-bumper traffic Thursday on a highway from Galveston County into Houston. The unusually strong wording came in a weather advisory regarding storm surge along the shoreline of Galveston Bay, which could see maximum water levels of 15 to 22 feet, the agency said. \"All neighborhoods ... and possibly entire coastal communities ... will be inundated during the period of peak storm tide,\" the advisory said. \"Persons not heeding evacuation orders in single-family one- or two-story homes will face certain death.\" The maximum water level forecasts in nearby areas, including the shoreline of Matagorda Bay and the Gulf-facing coastline from Sargent to High Island, ranged from 5 to 8 feet. But authorities warned that tide levels could begin rising Friday morning along the upper Texas coast and along the shorelines of the bays. The advisory summoned memories of the language used to describe 2005's Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of the U.S. Gulf Coast. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks ... if not longer,\" an advisory issued at the time said. \"The vast majority of native trees will be snapped or uprooted. Only the heartiest will remain standing.\" The Ike advisory follows comes on the heels of similarly urgent messages earlier Thursday from federal authorities, who warned of a \"massive storm\" that could affect roughly 40 percent of the U.S. Gulf Coast. \"Do not take this storm lightly,\" Michael Chertoff, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said Thursday afternoon. \"This is not a storm to gamble with. It is large; it is powerful; it carries a lot of water.\" Chertoff and representatives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency said their efforts were focused on evacuations as Ike moved northwest at 12 mph across the central Gulf of Mexico with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph.  Track the storm \u00bb . Chertoff also urged people not to succumb to \"hurricane fatigue,\" referring to concerns that authorities were overestimating Ike's potential impact. \"Unless you're fatigued with living, I suggest you want to take seriously a storm of this size and scale,\" he said Thursday. Houston Mayor Bill White said he's heard that people who live in areas under a mandatory evacuation order say they plan to stay in their homes. He strongly urged against it. \"If you think you want to ride something out, and people are talking about a 20-foot wall of water coming at you, then you better think again,\" White said. At 5 p.m. Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said a hurricane warning was in effect between Morgan City, Louisiana, and Baffin Bay, Texas. A warning means hurricane conditions are likely within 24 hours. Ike's forecast track was through Galveston and the Houston metro area as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph. Currently a Category 2 storm about 700 miles across, Ike could make landfall near Galveston Island as early as Saturday morning.  Watch CNN meteorologists track Hurricane Ike \u00bb . At 11 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 115 miles from Ike's center, and tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 miles. The storm was centered 445 miles east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas, and about 340 miles east-southeast of Galveston, and was moving west-northwest at near 10 mph. Watch: National Hurricane center predicts Ike's path \u00bb . Roughly 3.5 million people live in the hurricane's potential impact zone, FEMA Administrator David Paulison said Thursday. In Galveston, Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas told the island's 60,000 people that they should leave. By 7:30 ET, the city had finished evacuating to Austin thousands of residents who needed assistance leaving because of age, disability or lack of reliable transportation. Mandatory evacuations remained in effect for low-lying coastal areas northeast and southwest of Galveston, in Chambers, Matagorda and Brazoria counties. Some Brazoria County residents said they didn't want to leave but realized it was in their best interest to do so. \"You don't have a choice when you have kids,\" Deborah Davis of Freeport told CNN affiliate KPRC-TV in Houston. Farther inland, about 100,000 residents in low-lying areas surrounding Houston began evacuating Thursday afternoon as Ike headed for the Texas coast, officials said.  Watch Gov. Rick Perry warn residents of Ike's potential \u00bb . But the remaining 4 million residents were told they could stay home, even as government offices and schools prepared to close Friday in Houston in anticipation of the hurricane. \"We are only evacuating areas subject to a storm surge,\" said Harris County Judge Ed Emmett, the county's chief executive officer. \"Yes, we know you will lose electricity. But you're not in danger of losing your life, so stay put.\" Ships in port were told to leave, said Port of Houston spokeswoman Linda Whitlock. The area's two major airports, George Bush Intercontinental and William P. Hobby, also halted all commercial flights. More than 1,300 inmates from the Texas Correctional Institutions Division's Stevenson Unit in Cuero were being evacuated to facilities in Beeville and Kenedy, Perry's office said, and 597 were transferred from the substance abuse Glossbrenner Unit in San Diego, in south Texas, to Dilley. CNN's Mike Mount contributed to this report.", "52a68e9f8f4d36a669e207d66273a2d773c05cac": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An Ohio death row inmate who says he is too overweight to be executed took his plea to the Supreme Court on Friday. Richard Cooey, 41, and an accomplice were convicted of the 1986 murders of two college students. Richard Cooey is scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday and has exhausted most of his state and federal appeals. Gov. Ted Strickland earlier Friday denied the 41-year-old prisoner's clemency petition. Cooey murdered two college students in 1986. The justices were expected to decide whether he should receive a stay of execution, and whether to address the larger constitutional claims over when a convicted person is medically unfit for capital punishment. His lawyers have argued that the inmate-- at 5-foot-7 and 267 pounds -- is \"morbidly obese,\" and has gained about 70 pounds since his incarceration at age 19. Prison food and confinement in his cell for 23 hours a day, limiting his opportunities for exercise, contributed to his weight problem, his legal team said in recent court filings. Cooey also says regular medication he takes for migraines will weaken the effectiveness of an anesthetic used in the a three-drug cocktail administered during execution. He says his veins are weakened because of his health issues, and the lethal drugs would amount to cruel and unusual punishment. In 2003, one day before Cooey was scheduled to die, a judge stopped his execution on issues unrelated to his health claims. A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that Cooey waited too long to raise the medical issues, saying he \"knew of and could have filed suit over vein access prior to July 2005.\" Cooey and a then-17-year-old accomplice were convicted of the brutal murders of Wendy Offredo and Dawn McCreery, students at the University of Akron. The men had been tossing concrete slabs onto Interstate 77, and one of them struck Offredo's car. Pretending to rescue the women, Cooey and Clinton Dickens took them to a remote field, according to prosecutors. There, the students were subjected to 3\u00bd hours of rape, torture, stabbings and fatal bludgeonings. Cooey had carved an \"X\" into the stomachs of both women, prosecutors said. Each man blamed the other for delivering the fatal blows, but both were convicted of murder. Dickens received a life sentence because of his age. Cooey tried to escape from death row in 2005, when corrections officials said he constructed a ladder from magazines and bedsheets in an effort to scale the barrier around an outdoor recreation area. At an August clemency hearing, Jon Offredo, brother of one of the victims, said, \"Our family has never gotten an apology from Richard Cooey. We've gotten blatant lies and excuses. Is an apology too much to ask? How could he commit such a heinous act and not feel regret?\" But Cooey's lawyer, Dana Cole, said his client is sorry for his crimes. The high court has not offered clear guidelines on what medical standards need to be met before an inmate is eligible for death. But in a case five years ago, the justices allowed inmates to at least make a claim that their specific physical or medical issues could be cause to block an execution. The high court had sided with a convicted Alabama killer who claimed his veins were so damaged from years of drug abuse that executioners might have to cut deeply into his flesh to administer the deadly drugs. Writing for the unanimous court, then-Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the court was not going to \"open the floodgates to all manner of method-of-execution challenges,\" as Alabama feared. \"Our holding is extremely limited.\" That inmate is still on death row. Richard Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center, a data-resource group that opposes capital punishment, said the Supreme Court indicated that \"how you're going to be executed is a civil rights matter, the same as if you were discriminated [against] on the basis of race or gender or something like that.\" A Washington state killer was given a reprieve in 1994 after claiming he was too obese to hang. Mitchell Rupe at one time was more than 425 pounds, but weight-loss surgery in prison had reduced that to 275 pounds over the years. Subsequent legal efforts to execute him failed. He died in prison two years ago from a long illness. The Ohio case is Cooey v.

Labor minister Oscar Fernandes was criticized for saying Chaudhary's death was warning to management. The 63 were among 137 people police had rounded up by Wednesday -- two days after a mob of fired employees attacked L.K. Chaudhary, the chief executive of an Italian car parts manufacturing company. The others were charged with disturbing the peace in the Monday incident in Noida, located in the outskirts of the capital New Delhi. More arrests are likely, said R. K.

Undecided voters gathered at Emory University, where Dr. Drew Westen studies how brains react to messages. Political strategists know that the most successful candidates are masters at capitalizing on fears such as these, and that can make a huge difference at the polls. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson was running for president against conservative Barry Goldwater when his campaign unleashed the \"daisy ad.\" It showed a little girl counting as she plucked a daisy, charmingly mixing up her numbers. Then a baritone voice takes over,  counting down to an overwhelming nuclear explosion. It's followed with a warning that the stakes are too high not to vote for Johnson. The ad, which ran only once, was so chilling and effective, analysts say, it helped Johnson win the presidency by one of the widest margins in U.S. history. CNN recently gathered eight undecided voters to see how they would respond to attack ads and how the ads might affect their choices. They met at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, where psychologist Drew Westen studies how brains react to candidates' messages. Westen, who wrote \"The Political Brain,\" said fear-based attack ads are effective because they tap into a voter's subconscious. \"Those kinds of gut-level reactions tell us things like, 'I don't feel like this person is telling us the truth,' \" Westen said. \"Unless someone is a really good con man, those reactions are extremely helpful. The conscious brain processes only a tiny percent of information.\" Westen and his business partner, Joel Weinberger, have created software, through their company ThinkScan, that looks into a voter's subconscious. The software does this by measuring people's reaction time to certain words after they watch attack ads. The undecided voters in CNN's group watched the ads and were then asked to identify the color of words such as \"weak,\" \"inexperienced\" and \"terrorist.\" If they hesitated, even for one-thousandth of a second, before they clicked on the color that corresponded with the word, Weinberger said, it meant the word had an impact. \"If the word is on their mind, if the word was activated, it will slow them down,\" Weinberger said. Westen predicted that the undecided voters would say they didn't like the ads and that the ads had no impact on them. He was right. The group watched Hillary Clinton's \"3 a.m.\" campaign ad, which was intended to make voters question Barack Obama's experience. Viewers said that the ad was fear-mongering and that it did not make them think Clinton was a stronger leader than Obama. But the data, Westen said, showed that their brains reacted differently. Voters had the greatest hesitation with words like \"weak\" and \"lightweight\" during the color test. Westen said this meant the ad made them question Obama's readiness. \"The purpose, too, is to make him seem scary, dangerous. 'You need to be afraid of this guy as president,' \" Westen said. \"That message unconsciously got through.\" The undecided voters also watched an ad attacking John McCain for saying the U.S. could be in Iraq for the next 100 years. After watching the ad, the group gave it a thumbs-down. But researchers said the data showed that it left them feeling McCain has poor judgment and is too close to President Bush. The results were identical when the same test was given to a much larger group of 100 voters. This happens because the ads trigger a response in the part of the brain called the amygdala, which experiences emotions such as fear. When it is aroused, it overrides logic, according to Westen. Despite the ability of attack ads to affect voters' subconscious thinking, Westen cautions that fear-based ads are risky because they can backfire. What advice does Westen have for presidential hopefuls? \"They should make voters feel inspired by them and worried about their opponent at the same time,\" Westen said. \"It works.\"", "702c2aa8bae672c61d43b1a62707b224c5aff396": "(CNN) -- Residents of a western Pennsylvania neighborhood can return home Sunday after a chemical leak forced them to evacuate the night before. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee Saturday after a chemical leak in Petrolia, Pennsylvania. Authorities surveyed the neighborhood in Petrolia and determined that no traces of the toxic chemical remained, said Freda Tarbell, spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. A leak at the Indspec Chemical Corp. plant in Petrolia on Saturday formed a cloud affecting at least 2,000 residents -- some of whom fled their homes. Others huddled indoors with their windows shut, authorities said. Three people were taken to hospitals, but officials could not immediately say why.  Watch why residents were asked to evacuate \u00bb . It was not immediately clear how many people were injured, though plant manager Dave Dorko said all employees and inspectors at the plant were safe and accounted for. Tarbell described the chemical as fuming sulfuric acid, which is also known as oleum. The plant uses the chemical during its production process, she said. The plant produces a chemical called Resorcinol -- essentially a strong glue used in the tire industry. The leak affected between 2,000 and 2,500 residents, Tarbell said. Some stayed the night with friends and relatives and some sought refuge in shelters. Others opted to stay indoors and \"shut their windows and doors to make sure the acid cloud was not entering their home,\" she said.

But the job she's about to interview for is the job of jobs, and it's going to require her to sacrifice what she has at home.\" Stably has children of his own, and his wife works full-time. He says this experience has helped shape his views on Palin: \"Doesn't everyone, male or female, think about the impact a job offer would have on their personal life before accepting the offer?\" \"It's not a sexist thing,\" said Jeanette Lee, who is raising a 15-month-old baby of her own. \"If my family was having these sorts of issues, I wouldn't be putting them in the spotlight and making them go through this publicly. For her to walk away from her baby with special needs just shows her character. I feel like she should pay more attention to her whole family.\" \"If her children were older, it wouldn't be an issue,\" Lee added. Others feel Palin's family situation would have a negative impact on her effectiveness as vice president. \"I want my president to be my president. It is a difficult, sometimes thankless, and emotionally devastating job that requires 100 percent resolve at all times,\" said Carlton Madden, from West Monroe, Louisiana. \"I think she has a lot on her plate ... I have no problem with a woman being president, but I'm going to hold her to the same standards I'd hold a man. If [Obama] had a pregnant teen daughter and a child with special needs, I'd have serious reservations about his ability to make a split-second decision, too.\" Christina Walker, of Austin, Texas, who has a 1-year-old daughter, says her experience as a mom has led her to the same conclusion. \"I opted to change my career path so I could spend more time with my child, and I'm trying to manage both the career and the child,\" she said. \"It's very challenging, and I'm not in nearly the type of stressful role that she would be in.\" But some think Palin's experience as a mom would only make her a better vice president. Carolyn Jasper of Shreveport, Louisiana, says Palin's experience as a mother makes her a better candidate because she knows what it's like to balance life and work and can understand the lives of \"regular\" Americans. \"I can tell you one thing about being a mom. You learn real quick how to work through all of life's huge problems and bring them down to a manageable size,\" said Jasper, who has three children of her own. \"I do think she'll be more capable of understanding what the regular American people need from their government because she is a mom and a family person.\" So is there a double standard at work? Some iReporters think so.   \"Why aren't we questioning how Obama can raise his kids?\" asked Shawn Strode of Orlando, Florida. \"Mind you, having a Down Syndrome child is going to be more challenging, but are we assuming the dad can't step in and be a parent? We automatically assume that first ladies can be great parents and that it won't take away from the father being the president. I don't think it will affect her job that much.\" \"I'm a little tired of hearing about Bristol and her pregnancy,\" said Katy Brown, a freshman at Kent State University in Ohio. \"This has nothing to do with the campaign. It has nothing to do with how well Sarah Palin will lead the country. ...This just shows that they're a normal family.\" Lisa Stiles, of Richmond, Virginia, has been involved in grassroots campaigning for nuclear energy throughout her career and says Palin inspired her to consider running for office in the future. She thinks this discussion would never have come up if Palin was a man. \"Are people forgetting that she has a husband?\" Stiles asked. \"I would think people would be applauding the fact that such a reversal of traditional gender roles is possible.\" And Jordan Saver of Athens, Georgia, believes there is a different kind of sexism going on in the race: \"We're giving [Palin] credit for being a mother and a politician, but Barack Obama doesn't get credit for being a father and a politician,\" he said. \"It's reverse discrimination. But if they mentioned it, it would be seen as sexist.\" \"It's the wrong conversation to be having,\" added Kathryn Ova of New York City, who describes herself as a \"die-hard feminist.\" \"Our overall belief system of putting work ahead of family for both men and women is kind of dominating right now. It's coming up because she's a woman, but putting work ahead of family is a major issue regardless of gender.\"", "a48b3d9f2f02de081b3fdab39a3e3107e3c24dcd": "Editor's note: Glenn Beck is on CNN Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET and also is host of a conservative national radio talk show. Glenn Beck has some lines McCain can use in tonight's speech to articulate his vision for change . NEW YORK (CNN) -- Campaigns are ugly. Watching the way politicians act makes you long for the respect and self-control of the Sopranos. Throughout, there are legitimate attacks and outright lies. Every once in a while, I get a call on my radio show from someone telling me that Barack Obama is secretly a Muslim, who admitted it in an interview with George Stephanopoulos, and has a fake birth certificate. No, no, and no. As I tell them, there are legitimate reasons not to vote for Barack Obama, no need to make them up. But the newest target is Sarah Palin. Let's take a quick look at just a fraction of what she has faced in her first few days as John McCain's choice for vice president. iReport.com: Do you think Palin is being treated unfairly? \"Sarah Palin believes God told her to go to war with Iraq!\" There has been some hard-core journalistic malpractice on this one. The Associated Press ran this headline about a speech she gave at her church: \"Palin: Iraq war 'a task that is from God'\" In the story, they omit the first part of the sentence they're quoting along with the entire previous sentence for good measure. Here are her actual words: \"Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right. Also, for this country, that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending them out on a task that is from God. That's what we have to make sure that we're praying for, that there is a plan and that that plan is God's plan.\" Palin is clearly praying that we're doing the right thing in Iraq, something sensible for an introspective woman of faith concerned about the lives of our troops to do. She's not saying that she just received a text message from heaven's BlackBerry ordering her to launch missiles. Sorry to disappoint you. And for those of you who think politicians asking God for guidance is offensive, might I remind you of this famous politician's prayer: . \"Give me the wisdom to do what is right and just. And make me an instrument of your will.\" --Barack Obama . \"She has no experience!\" It's fair to assume that Barack Obama believed he was qualified to be in the White House when he announced he was running for president. At that point, he had been a U.S. Senator for 767 days. When Sarah Palin was announced as a vice presidential candidate, she had been the governor of Alaska for 634 days. While I'm sure those extra 133 days were filled with personal discovery, I can't imagine anyone seriously trying to make the case that Obama is experienced and Palin isn't. Unless, of course, you're Matt Damon, who said a Palin presidency would be a really \"scary thing\" because she has been \"governor of Alaska for...for less than two years!\" (Damon originally expressed his presidential preference for Obama in December 2006, when he had been a senator for less than two years.) More importantly, Palin's career has been filled with executive experience. She's the only one of the four in this race who has run a business, town, and/or state (a state that gives her crucial energy experience in the middle of an energy crisis). When Obama's campaign complains that Palin would be one heartbeat away from the presidency, they should consider that their candidate would be zero heartbeats away. \"But Obama is running a huge campaign -- Palin was just a small town mayor!\" Believe it or not, this one was actually trotted out by Obama himself. \"My understanding is, is that Gov. Palin's town of Wasilla has, I think, 50 employees. We've got 2,500 in this campaign. I think the budget is maybe $12 million a year. We have a budget of about three times that just for the month.\" Apparently, Barack missed that she's become the governor of Alaska in the interim. Why would he compare his current duties with her former duties? Well, since he announced his candidacy, Barack Obama has raised about $22 million a month. That's a large organization for sure, unless you are directly comparing it to Sarah Palin, who is handling state revenues that are about 61 times as large, or more than $1.3 billion per month. \"Palin only supports abstinence to be taught in sex-ed!\" This claim is usually followed by a super classy comment about her daughter and the use of contraception, but the premise is false. Palin hasn't said she doesn't want condoms discussed in sex-ed, calling their discussion \"relatively benign.\" \"I'm pro-contraception, and I think kids who may not hear about it at home should hear about it in other avenues. So I am not anti-contraception. But, yeah, abstinence is another alternative that should be discussed with kids. I don't have a problem with that,\" Palin said. Hers is hardly an extreme point of view in America today. \"If she cares about children with special needs, then why did she cut spending on them by 62 percent?\" Actually, Palin almost tripled their funding in only three years from $26,900 per student to $73,840 per student. Incidentally, the amount of government money you spend on a specific group doesn't equal the amount you care for that group, but that's another story for another column. All of these represent just a small percentage of the bizarre collection of claims being thrown at Palin by her opponents and some in the media -- who are desperately hoping something will stick. I leave you with my favorite so far: The Internet rumors that she harbors racism against Eskimos. If true, she sure has a strange way of expressing it -- her husband, Todd, is half Yupik Inuit Eskimo. To balance that out, she must really love his other half. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.", "cfdd2789ac2ccd81990912d156caa764532985f7": "(CNN) -- Ambitious plans to build a revolutionary 420-meter shape-shifting skyscraper in Dubai have been unveiled by architects. The 80-story Dynamic Tower, described as the \"world's first building in motion,\" will also be the first skyscraper constructed from prefabricated units, according to a press statement released by New York-based architect David Fisher's Dynamic Group. Each floor would be capable of rotating independently, powered by wind turbines fitted between each floor. \"You can adjust the shape the way you like every given moment,\" Fisher said. \"It's not a piece of architecture somebody designed today and that's it. It remains forever. It's designed by life, shaped by time.\"  Watch how the tower would spin and twist \u00bb . Apartments will sell for about $3,000 per square foot, making each unit range in price from about $4 million to $40 million. Work on the tower is to be completed by 2010, according to Dynamic's Web site. Fisher said that plans to build a second rotating skyscraper in Moscow were at an advanced stage and that the group intended to build a third tower in New York. He said developers and public officials in Canada, Europe and South Korea had also expressed interest in the project. But some have expressed skepticism. Fisher has never built a skyscraper before. He says he has teamed up with reputable architects and engineers in the United Kingdom and India. Although he has received a development license for construction in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, he has not disclosed the site of the building. The Moscow mayor's office said that it was looking into the project and that a decision had not been made. Fisher has called prefabricated construction techniques the \"future of architecture\" and says they will radically transform 4,000-year-old \"brick-on-brick\" building methods. By using preconstructed parts, Fisher said each story could be built in just seven days, resulting in environmentally cleaner building methods. He said that just 600 people on an assembly site and 80 technicians on the construction site would be needed to build the tower, compared with about 2,000 workers for a traditional project of a comparable scale. \"It is unbelievable that real estate and construction, which is the leading sector of the world economy, is also the most primitive,\" Fisher is quoted as saying on Dynamic's Web site. \"Most workers throughout the world still regularly use trowels that was first used by the Egyptians and then by the Romans. Buildings should not be different than any other product, and from now on they will be manufactured in a production facility.\" Dubai is experiencing a construction boom, with the Burj tower set to claim the title of the world's tallest building when it is completed in 2009. It is already home to the world's largest mall, and despite being in the Middle East, it boasts the largest indoor snow park in the world.", "7e746f6c103c401321aa4c55c891d3c7e09f102d": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Robert Mugabe's political rivals Saturday accused the Zimbabwean president of  \"ambush\" in allocating key ministries to his own party in defiance of a power-sharing agreement aimed at ending political turmoil in the country. The opposition MDC accuses Mugabe of \"ambush.\" Zimbabwe's state-run Herald newspaper reported that ministries inlcuding defense, justice, and media, were being placed in the hands of Mugabe's ZANU-PF. Party spokesman Bright Matonga said the move had cross-party support but the Movement for Democratic Change's Nelson Chamisa decried the move is an \"ambush\" that puts the power-sharing deal in jeopardy. Under the deal reached last month, Mugabe stays in office but shares power with MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who became vice president. Arthur Mutambara, who leads a splinter MDC faction, became deputy vice president. \"The MDC dismisses ZANU-PF's unilaterally gazetted wish list of ministries, which is a betrayal of the wishes, expectations and aspirations of the majority of Zimbabweans,\" the MDC said in a statement. \"It is a giant act of madness which puts the whole deal into jeopardy.\" The plan outlined in The Herald would give 14 government ministries to ZANU-PF and 13 to the MDC. Three ministries would go to Mutambara's faction. Among the ministries reportedly allocated to ZANU-PF are defense, home affairs, foreign affairs, justice and legal affairs, and media and information. Ministries given to Tsvangirai's MDC would include constitutional and parliamentary affairs, economic planning, health, labor, and sport, arts and culture, the paper said. Mutambara would oversee education, industry and commerce, and regional integration and international cooperation. The ministry of finance, the paper said, remains in dispute. The MDC accused the ZANU-PF of trying to undermine the work of former South African President Thabo Mbeki, who helped broker a deal to end months of violence following a disputed election. The paper said Mbeki was due to to go Zimbabwe to resolve the question of the finance ministry. Mbeki mediated the power-sharing talks that aimed to resolve the disputed March election. Tsvangirai won the most votes in March but not enough to avoid a runoff, according to the government's official count. Tsvangirai withdrew from the June 27 runoff days before the vote, saying Mugabe's supporters had waged a campaign of violence and intimidation against opposition supporters.", "80108d5b174413073b3dff2dfe5ec60942019d61": "(CNN) -- Seven years after devastating terrorist attacks brought death to New York's World Trade Centers, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field, the first permanent, on-site memorial is being dedicated Thursday at the Pentagon. An artist's rendering shows the New York 9/11 memorial, with the museum entry pavilion between two pools. Official memorials at the other two sites are still years away. In New York, construction has begun on a complex that will include a memorial with a tree-shaded plaza and reflecting pools, and an underground museum with an entry pavilion. It's part of a bigger project, including new office towers and a transportation hub, whose target date has been repeatedly delayed. The goal is to open the memorial to the public by the 10th anniversary of the attacks, in 2011, and the museum by the year after. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg stressed the importance of those dates and called progress \"frustratingly slow\" in an opinion piece published Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal. \"The memorial must be completed by the 10th anniversary,\" Bloomberg wrote. \"No more excuses, no more delays.\"  Watch and listen to Thursday's memorial services \u00bb . However, on CNN's \"American Morning\" Thursday, Bloomberg said quality is more important than speed of construction. \"We want to make sure what we build is the right thing, that 100 years from now people will look back and say, 'They built it well and built the right thing,'\" Bloomberg said. \"Nobody's going to remember if it took five years or 10 years. I'd like it to go faster. I've recommended we reduce the level of bureaucracy, but that's not our number one priority.\" Federal, state and local governments, as well as several agencies and private developers are involved in the planning and construction. \"It's a complex site, and there was an extensive public process involved in determining the plans for the site,\" Lynn Rasic of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum said Wednesday. \"And I think what's important now is that we look forward and do everything possible to meet the 10th anniversary date.\" iReport: How are you observing 9/11? The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site, says it's on board as far as the date for opening the memorial. Completion dates for the museum and pavilion are part of a review to be finished by September 30, Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman said. \"We don't want to put any more false hopes, false dates out there in the public domain that can't be met. That's why they want to make sure this thing is a thorough review and we have realistic and achievable dates that we come out with,\" he said. Coleman said the Port Authority hasn't felt pressure from families of September 11 victims to speed up the process. \"What we're hearing from family members is that they want to see it done right, rather than rushed,\" he said. The memorial will feature two huge reflecting pools, with waterfalls flowing down their sides, where the iconic twin towers stood, according to the memorial's Web site. Engraved around the pools will be the names of those who died in the September 11 attacks as well as the victims of a 1993 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.  Watch and listen to sights and sounds from 9/11 \u00bb . The steel and glass entry pavilion will include two large steel columns salvaged from the twin towers. As visitors descend underground into the museum, they'll see the slurry wall, the bedrock that held back the Hudson River when the towers collapsed. The Pennsylvania memorial is also scheduled to be completed by the 10th anniversary of the attacks. It will center on the site where United Flight 93 crashed after passengers apparently wrested control of the plane from the hijackers. A plaza will surround the crash site, known as Sacred Ground. Plans call for a Tower of Voices, with 40 windchimes representing the 40 passengers and crew members who died. The Pentagon memorial, opening Thursday, includes a bench, a tree and a pool for each of the 184 people killed there when another hijacked airliner crashed into the building.

Palin revealed Monday that her daughter Bristol is pregnant and plans to marry the father. The announcement followed Internet rumors that Sarah Palin's 4-month-old baby was actually Bristol's. iReport.com users posted dozens of stories and hundreds of comments in response to the news. Many iReporters said that the issue is a personal matter, while others believed that the pregnancy deserves public attention. Republican presidential candidate McCain was aware of Bristol's pregnancy before he chose Palin as his running mate, a top adviser to the Arizona senator said. Democratic presidential nominee Sen.

Phillips, who describes herself as politically moderate, said conservatives' support of Palin is \"absolutely hypocritical.\" \"While I understand that Palin's role as a mother may or may not be debated here for the political sphere, this situation does call into question some of her policies during her role as governor and her character as a person,\" Phillips said. iReport.com: Read more from Phillips .

Fire draws near homes in the Los Angeles-area community of Porter Ranch, California, on Monday. \"We are concerned about what will happen tonight when the winds pick up,\"  Los Angeles Fire Chief Douglas Barry said Monday. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger Monday declared a state of emergency Monday in Los Angeles and Ventura counties because of the fires.  Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, whose district covers the area where the fire is burning, called on President Bush to issue a federal disaster declaration for the area. At least two people have died because of the blazes, which have burned 8,000 acres in the hills and mountains of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, fire and police officials said. One was identified as a man who died in a makeshift wood-and-cardboard shelter and appeared to be homeless. A dog's body also was found. The other victim was killed in a collision of motorists who were trying to exit a freeway that was closed because of one of the wildfires, a fire official said. No identity or age was available for either victim. \"Winds are causing fire conditions to change by the hour,\" Schwarzenegger said in a statement released Monday. \"Several thousand acres have already burned with minimal containment and more acres are threatened.\" iReport.com: Are wildfires affecting you?

Fire officials warned that strong winds, predicted to reach more than 60 mph after 11 p.m., could send fire roaring south down the Pacific coast near Highway 101. Officials have shut two freeways north of Los Angeles and authorities dispatched water-dropping helicopters and more than 200 fire engines as the blaze \"started to push toward the city,\" said John Tripp of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.  About 350 police officers are on the scene, patrolling evacuated neighborhoods and warning residents ahead of the flames. Officials shut down part of Interstate 210, also known as the Foothill Freeway, and any residents north of the freeway were under a mandatory evacuation order. The fire jumped the interstate in one spot and headed toward the Lake View Terrace area. A portion of State Route 118, known as the Ronald Reagan Freeway, also was closed. The larger of the two fires has charred more than 3,500 acres in the Angeles National Forest, officials said.  See video of the Angeles National Forest fire \u00bb . That fire destroyed several structures, including about 30 mobile homes in the Lopez Canyon area, said Los Angeles County fire inspector Sam Padilla. The mobile homes had been evacuated Sunday. The other fire, burning nearby, is expected to expand as the winds push the flames away from the center.

Krishna Rajarman,  a Fulbright Scholar and honors student, was a junior at UCLA. \"We asked him, 'Why not stay a weekend because we might do something fun?' \" said Ashwin Bhongir, Krishna's roommate and childhood friend. \"He said, 'I want to be here for my brothers. I like to spend time with my brothers, it's important.'\" Krishna, a 19-year-old junior at UCLA, a Fulbright Scholar and an honors student, was found Monday fatally shot at his parents' home in suburban Los Angeles. Police said his father  killed the teen, his two younger brothers, ages 7 and 12, his grandmother and mother. Karthik Rajaram, a 45-year-old unemployed financial services expert, then killed himself, police said. The six bodies were discovered in their neatly tended home in an upscale suburb 20 minutes outside Los Angeles on Monday. A neighbor called police to report that the wife had failed to pick her up to take her to her job. Inside the house, police also found letters from the father explaining that mounting financial pressure had led him to kill. Fraternity member Vim Mahadev remembered Krishna as a devoted L.A. Lakers fan who occasionally mentioned family problems, but nothing unusual. \"Nothing ever came up serious,\" said Mahadev. \"It was mostly his dad, about financial problems. But most of the time it was how he was his hero because he was intelligent and he always knew the right decisions to make. \"It's just so ironic.\" Krishna's friends Bhongir and Nahel Patel grew up around the Rajaram family and told CNN they never saw signs of family turmoil during their teenage years.   \"I knew his family very well, and every time I went there, it was one of the most welcoming homes I've ever been to,\" said Bhongir. \"It was always a fun loving place to be.\"   \"He was one of the most promising friends that I ever knew, he was literally the smartest person I've ever known,\" said Bhongir. \"He was going to make it.\" Bhongir and Nahel, both business economic majors at UCLA, said Krishna's father was a role model to them. Krishna had wanted to follow his father's footsteps in studies and career. The father received his MBA from UCLA in 1987, according to UCLA spokesman Phil Hampton. Police said he went on to work in a financial holding company and for major accounting firms, such as Price Waterhouse. As a freshman, Krishna joined the campus co-ed fraternity Delta Phi Beta, organized by South Asian students. Fraternity member Natasha Parikh said she was one of Krishna's closest friends.  \"I just talked to him on Wednesday, and he was so excited about the new recruits we were having,\" she said. \"He was so excited about this year, and it's so painful that he can't be here to experience the rest of our time at UCLA.\" \"He really didn't talk about his personal life; I always saw him as a happy guy who never once said he was going through any major difficulty, so this has come as a complete shock.\"", "74050867f3fbe3043aba1f0ead4636a9ffd788ee": "(OPRAH.com) -- Oprah has always said that mothers have the most difficult job on earth, and actress Jenny McCarthy is one mom who has never backed down from a challenge. Doctors removed Monica's uterus, ovaries, gallbladder and part of her colon, along with her legs and arms. Jenny has been an outspoken advocate for parents of children with autism since her son was diagnosed with the disease two and a half years ago. In her new book, \"Mother Warriors,\" Jenny tells the story of other moms fighting for their special-needs kids. So when Oprah heard about Monica, another mom fighting for her children, she thought Jenny would be just the person to get this mother warrior's story. After going through a painful divorce, Monica met Tony when she least expected it. Monica already had a 9-year-old daughter, but soon after she and Tony got engaged, they were thrilled to be expecting another bundle of joy. In August 2007, she had a C-section, and though she worried about complications, Monica delivered a healthy baby girl. But hours after Sofia was born, Monica began running a fever. No one was concerned at first -- Monica figured it was just hormones -- but three days later the fever hadn't broken, and Monica's abdomen was swollen and painful. iReport.com: What do you think about this story? Sound off on video . The doctors at Monica's hospital thought she might be infected with a deadly strain of bacteria. They flew her to a hospital in Boston where she was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, also known as flesh-eating bacteria. Defying the odds, Monica survived, but many of her organs didn't. The doctors removed Monica's uterus, ovaries, gallbladder and part of her colon that same day. Within four weeks, Monica's infection had restricted the blood flow to her arms and legs. Her nurses cleaned her limbs every day, and she knew they were trying to keep her from seeing the damage. But Monica wanted to face the disease head on. \"I needed to know what I was up against. I didn't want to be shielded anymore,\" Monica says. Eventually, doctors told Monica they had to amputate both arms and both legs. The surgery sounded scary, but Monica was determined to put it behind her and get back to her daughters. \"I was frightened at first, but when they told me [my arms and legs] had to be amputated, it was: 'Do it. I've got to go home,'\" Monica says. \"[I thought,] 'I have a life to live and it's not here, and until you amputate, I can't move forward.'\" After her amputation, Monica spent two months in the hospital, where she underwent a total of 37 surgeries. As Monica grew stronger, Tony realized there was no reason to postpone their wedding any longer -- they got married in the hospital chapel in October, 2007. Monica spent the next two months going through grueling rehabilitation. \"She's a fighter,\" Tony says. \"If they told her two hours of physical therapy a day, she'd ask to double it up to four. She wanted to come home as soon as possible. They didn't think she'd ever walk again, but she made it happen.\" Right before Christmas, Monica got what she'd been waiting for. She was given the okay to go home to her husband and two daughters. A year later, Jenny visited Monica and her family at their home outside Boston, Massachusetts. \"I had a big aha! moment after spending six hours with her. Monica accepted what is. She looked down and said: 'Okay, this is the situation. I can't change this, so I might as well surrender to it,'\" Jenny says. \"When she does that, she is able to move forward in peace.\" Oprah.com: Jenny McCarthy answers parenting questions . Nurses and doctors say they expected a \"why me?\" breakdown from Monica while she was in the hospital, but it never happened. \"I did have moments of 'If God just left me one arm or one leg, life would be a little bit easier,' but that's not the way it went,\" Monica says. \"You make do with what you have. I could still love my girls. The bottom line was I am still here.\" Monica's not the only warrior in this family. Jenny calls Tony a daddy warrior because he always stood by Monica and their family. \"I actually considered not marrying him because I wasn't the person he agreed to marry,\" Monica says. \"But then I realized he loves me. He's here, and he's my heart. I'm still a woman, and I still have a heart and a mind, regardless of whether I have arms or legs.\" Tony says that there was never even a moment when he considered leaving Monica. \"She was the same person inside, so nothing had changed,\" he says. \"At one point, they went to bring in a preacher to give her last rights, and I turned him away and said: 'No, she's got a lot to fight for. She's not going anywhere, she'll be here for our family.' And she was. She is.\" Monica's family has been there for her too. When 9-year-old Madalyn found out about the surgeries, she took the news well. \"She'd been watching 'Dancing with the Stars,' and Heather Mills was on,\" Monica says. \"I told her, 'Well, I won't be doing back flips.' But she was excited and said, 'You can be bionic mom.'\" At Monica's house, she and Jenny had a mom-to-mom chat about the issues that mother warriors face. \"Within the autism community, one of the things that we, as mothers, miss so much is being able to caress our children, because they don't want to be touched,\" Jenny says. \"Do you experience that?\" Monica says she has similar moments of sadness. \"For a while, I really couldn't lift Sofia up,\" she says. \"I could hug Madalyn and have her hug me back, so that was good, but I miss being able to braid her hair, paint her fingernails, toenails -- the things that moms and daughters do.\" All mothers face frustrations, but Monica's come with tasks that used to be simple. \"I get frustrated about not being to do everything that I used to do,\" she says. \"Everything is different -- things as simple as picking up a pen or signing a paper for Madalyn at school.\" Monica hasn't let any of these obstacles stop her from living her life to the fullest. She does everything a mom would do, including paying the bills, which can take her up to three hours. \"It's the ultimate practice in patience,\" Jenny says.

That's not what I want to teach my kids,\" Monica says. \"I want my girls to know that their mother's a fighter.\" Monica's been adjusting to her new life for a little over a year, and she says her strength comes from her support system -- from family and friends to people at the hospital and rehab facility. There are more surgeries to come, she says, but she's taking it one day at a time. \"I've come to the realization that things are as they are, and you have to move forward. Life goes on,\" she says. \"There's no sense dwelling on it -- that just hurts too much and you don't live your life the way you want to.

Fire draws near homes in the Los Angeles-area community of Porter Ranch, California, on Monday. \"We are concerned about what will happen tonight when the winds pick up,\"  Los Angeles Fire Chief Douglas Barry said Monday. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger Monday declared a state of emergency Monday in Los Angeles and Ventura counties because of the fires.  Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, whose district covers the area where the fire is burning, called on President Bush to issue a federal disaster declaration for the area. At least two people have died because of the blazes, which have burned 8,000 acres in the hills and mountains of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, fire and police officials said. One was identified as a man who died in a makeshift wood-and-cardboard shelter and appeared to be homeless. A dog's body also was found. The other victim was killed in a collision of motorists who were trying to exit a freeway that was closed because of one of the wildfires, a fire official said. No identity or age was available for either victim. \"Winds are causing fire conditions to change by the hour,\" Schwarzenegger said in a statement released Monday. \"Several thousand acres have already burned with minimal containment and more acres are threatened.\" iReport.com: Are wildfires affecting you? Residents downwind were warned to remain alert into the night. \"It can go from here to the ocean in a matter of two to three hours,\" said Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, The Associated Press reported. Barry said investigators have not determined a cause for either blaze. Fire officials warned that strong winds, predicted to reach more than 60 mph after 11 p.m., could send fire roaring south down the Pacific coast near Highway 101. Officials have shut two freeways north of Los Angeles and authorities dispatched water-dropping helicopters and more than 200 fire engines as the blaze \"started to push toward the city,\" said John Tripp of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.  About 350 police officers are on the scene, patrolling evacuated neighborhoods and warning residents ahead of the flames. Officials shut down part of Interstate 210, also known as the Foothill Freeway, and any residents north of the freeway were under a mandatory evacuation order. The fire jumped the interstate in one spot and headed toward the Lake View Terrace area. A portion of State Route 118, known as the Ronald Reagan Freeway, also was closed. The larger of the two fires has charred more than 3,500 acres in the Angeles National Forest, officials said.  See video of the Angeles National Forest fire \u00bb . That fire destroyed several structures, including about 30 mobile homes in the Lopez Canyon area, said Los Angeles County fire inspector Sam Padilla. The mobile homes had been evacuated Sunday. The other fire, burning nearby, is expected to expand as the winds push the flames away from the center. In San Diego County, a wildfire that began on an explosives training range at Camp Pendleton had grown to more than 1,500 acres by nightfall and forced the evacuation of 1,400 homes, The AP reported.

O'Berry said the tugboat Rotterdam arrived shortly before 2 p.m. (3 p.m. ET). Repairs will be made aboard the Antalina, which has a broken fuel pump, while at sea, O'Berry said. The tugboat will then tow the ship to Port Arthur, Texas, where it will undergo additional repairs and eventually offload more of its cargo -- petroleum coke, a petroleum byproduct -- O'Berry said. The crew members aboard the Antalina, a Cypriot-flagged freighter, are all in good health, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Ron Labrec. The freighter suffered no major damage from the storm, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesman for the company that manages the ship. Aircraft from the Coast Guard and Air Force were sent Friday afternoon to try to rescue the crew of the freighter, which is loaded with petroleum coke, a petroleum byproduct. But high winds forced the military to abort the rescue, O'Berry said. The Coast Guard then instructed the freighter to contact it each hour. It also told told the crew to turn on the ship's emergency radio beacon so its position could be monitored, O'Berry said.  Watch the Coast Guard conduct a rescue operation \u00bb . Onshore as well, rescuers found it too dangerous to respond to calls for help. In Liverpool, Texas, south of Houston, a family called for help around 1 a.m. Saturday when a tree crashed into their house, but authorities concluded that strong winds made it too dangerous to respond, said Doc Adams, Brazoria County's emergency management coordinator. \"You want to take care of people, and when you can't, it's tough,\" Adams said. \"Unfortunately, someone has to make the decision about whether the risk is worth the benefit. Are you willing to risk three or four lives to save one? It's not easy.\" Adams said he didn't know if anyone in the house was hurt. \"As far as I know, they're still there in the house with a tree over it,\" he said at about 3:40 a.m. The stranded freighter had been headed south through the Gulf of Mexico from Port Arthur, Texas, but \"lost main propulsion 90 miles southeast of Galveston\" and was unable to steer, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard received a distress call from the vessel at 4 a.m. Friday. The Antalina was \"basically adrift, at the mercy of the wind and sea currents,\" Coast Guard Petty Officer Tom Atkeson said at the time. \"We are in hell,\" one of the men aboard the freighter told CNN on Friday before the rescue was called off. The man said the winds around the ship were strong but that the freighter still had power. On Friday before the storm hit, authorities picked up more than 120 people stranded by rising seas along the southeast Texas coast. Most of the rescues occurred in Galveston County, where rising water and other effects of the storm began hours before landfall early Saturday. Stranded residents were airlifted from Crystal Beach, Bolivar Peninsula and other communities in the Galveston area. Many of those rescued were motorists stranded on flooded roads. In Surfside Beach, police waded through chest-high rushing water to rescue five people trapped in their homes. One man refused to leave, said Surfside Beach police Chief Randy Smith. \"Some of them took convincing, some of them didn't,\" Smith said. Police also rescued five other people who waded out to meet the officers. About half of those rescues were done by helicopters out of bases along the coast, said Coast Guard Petty Officer David Schulein. Three HH-65C helicopters from Coast Guard Air Station Houston rescued more than 20 people and continued to fly rescue missions until weather grounded them Friday evening, said Petty Officer Renee Aiello, a station spokeswoman. Some 37,000 people may need to be rescued in the aftermath of the hurricane, a U.S. military official estimated Friday. Texas already has asked for help, and the active-duty military has 42 search-and-rescue helicopters on standby, the official said.", "7bdcea5310f665ee6ee9793ab0bcb046b2aef13e": "(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia could have helped the United States prevent al Qaeda's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington if American officials had consulted Saudi authorities in a \"credible\" way, the kingdom's former ambassador said in a documentary aired Thursday. The comments by Prince Bandar bin Sultan are similar to the remarks this week by Saudi King Abdullah that suggested Britain could have prevented the July 2005 train bombings in London if it had heeded warnings from Riyadh. Speaking to the Arabic satellite network Al-Arabiya on Thursday, Bandar -- now Abdullah's national security adviser -- said Saudi intelligence was \"actively following\" most of the September 11, 2001, plotters \"with precision.\" \"If U.S. security authorities had engaged their Saudi counterparts in a serious and credible manner, in my opinion, we would have avoided what happened,\" he said.  Watch Bandar's comments \u00bb . Bandar was the Saudi ambassador to Washington for nearly 22 years before he was replaced in 2005. A knowledgeable U.S. official told CNN that Bandar's comments should be taken \"with a grain of salt.\" On Monday, Abdullah told the BBC that Saudi Arabia had sent warnings to British authorities before the London subway bombings that killed 52 people -- the city's bloodiest day since World War II. \"We have sent information to Great Britain before the terrorist attacks in Britain,\" Abdullah said. \"But unfortunately, no action was taken, and it may have been able to avert the tragedy.\" The September 11 attacks killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. All but four of the suicide hijackers who carried out the plot were Saudi nationals, and after the attacks, the kingdom was widely criticized for having tolerated Islamic militancy. The Saudis have called the criticism unfair, pointing out that al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden's original grievance was against the country's ruling family, which invited U.S. troops into the kingdom after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. A string of attacks on Western compounds, oil installations and Saudi institutions between 2003 and 2006 were blamed on al Qaeda's followers.

Abu Qaswarah was second only to Abu Ayyub al-Masri (pictured) in al Qaeda in Iraq leadership. Abu Qaswarah, also known as Abu Sara, was killed during an operation in Mosul on October 5, the military said. The Moroccan native was second-in-command to al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) leader Abu Ayyub al-Masri, according to the military. He had \"historic ties\" to al-Masri's predecessor, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and senior al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the military said. Abu Qaswarah -- who became AQI's senior leader in northern Iraq in June 2007 -- was the target of the military raid in Mosul earlier this month, the military said. Coalition forces tracked him down inside a building in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, which \"served as a key command and control location for AQI,\" according to the military. \"Upon entering the building, forces were immediately fired upon,\" the military said. \"Coalition forces returned fire in self-defense, leading to the death of five terrorists. It was later determined that one of the five was positively identified as Abu Qaswarah.\" The U.S. military described Abu Qaswarah as a \"charismatic\" leader who rallied al Qaeda in Iraq's northern network after \"major setbacks to the terrorist organization across Iraq.\" Groups comprised mainly of former Sunni insurgents -- known as Awakening Councils or \"Sons of Iraq\" -- have turned against al Qaeda in Iraq, helping to diminish its presence in several parts of the country. The U.S. military credits them with playing a key role in bringing about the nationwide drop in violence that coincided with the \"surge\" of U.S. forces. Abu Qaswarah -- who trained with al Qaeda in Afghanistan -- helped bring foreign terrorists into northern Iraq, where they carried out a spate of suicide attacks, according to the military. He also organized and led AQI's attacks in Mosul, including the \"failed attempt to destroy the Mosul Civic Center during the holy month of Ramadan,\" which took place in September, the military said. That attack, the military said, \"could have killed hundreds of innocent Iraqis.\" The military said Abu Qaswarah's death \"will significantly degrade AQI operations in Mosul and northern Iraq, leaving the network without a leader to oversee and coordinate its operations in the region.\"", "0ec4fb22f189f34e80f4e78812d04f0b40c9c57b": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- A court in Dubai has sentenced two Britons to three months in prison for having sex on a public beach in the Muslim country.

Ahmed al-Omran said on his blog, saudijeans.org, and later told CNN that he was awakened by a text message from the wife of Fouad al-Farhan, saying he had been released and was at home with his family. \"That's great news, and this is just how I wanted to start my morning,\" al-Omran wrote. He said he later spoke with al-Farhan for several minutes on the telephone. \"He sounded fine; he seems to be in good spirits,\" al-Omran said. \"He said he would have more to talk about later but not at this point.

In the e-mail, al-Farhan said a senior Interior Ministry official promised that he would remain in custody for three days at most if he agreed to sign a letter of apology. \"I'm not sure if I'm ready to do that,\" he wrote. \"An apology for what? Apologizing because I said the government is [a] liar when they accused those guys of supporting terrorism?\" Al-Farhan, who blogs at alfarhan.org, is one of the few Saudi Web commentators to use his own name, according to the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists. In January, the Bush administration expressed its concerns to the Saudi government regarding al-Farhan's detention at \"a relatively senior level,\" U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. \"The U.S. stands for freedom of expression,\" McCormack said at the time. \"Wherever people are seeking to express themselves, via the Internet or via other areas, whether in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere in the world, we stand with that freedom of expression, and that was our message to the Saudi government.\" The American Islamic Congress, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization, launched an online letter-writing campaign aimed at freeing al-Farhan, whom it called \"the godfather of Saudi blogging.\" \"All he did was express his opinions in a very obvious way, and he didn't threaten anyone,\" al-Omran said. \"He was advocating against violence and terrorism.\" Al-Omran said al-Farhan had stopped blogging for a few months in late 2006, after the Interior Ministry ordered him to take down a blog he was operating, but he began again at a new site. He said al-Farhan told him he was treated well in jail. He also called al-Farhan's release a turning point for the blogging community in Saudi Arabia. \"It showed the community of bloggers in Saudi Arabia can come together and support this cause -- support his freedom of speech -- even those who didn't agree with some of the things he wrote,\" he said.

But he said the federal agency he worked for is now a \"cult of corruption\" -- a claim backed up by a recent government report. Bobby Maxwell, a long-time auditor of the oil industry, says his former agency is corrupt \"top to bottom.\" \"I believe the management we were under was showing favoritism to the oil industry,\" Maxwell told CNN. Maxwell is referring to a tiny agency within the Department of the Interior called the Minerals Management Service, which manages the nation's natural gas, oil and other mineral resources on federal lands. A report, conducted by the Interior Department's inspector general and released earlier this month, found that employees at the agency received improper gifts from energy industry officials and engaged with them in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations. It looked at activities at the agency from 2003 through 2006. Maxwell said the report doesn't surprise him. The agency, he said, is corrupt \"top to bottom.\"  Watch a failure to \"protect America's interests\" \u00bb . \"It sounds like they forgot they work for the government,\" he said. \"It's disgusting. ... There's no excuse for that. Those people should not be working in those positions at all. \"They crossed a lot of lines that should never have been crossed,\" he said. \"They lost all objectivity.\" Maxwell was in charge of keeping track of the millions in royalty payments owed taxpayers by oil and gas companies who explored and found oil on U.S. government lands. He estimates he and his team were responsible for saving the government close to $500 million in royalties, either underpaid or somehow skipped by oil and gas companies, over the years. He received the Interior Department's highest award in 2003 for his work. But not long afterward, his job was killed. He believes it was retribution for his cracking down on Big Oil and blowing the whistle on what he believes was a \"cult of corruption\" within the agency. The Interior Department denies that, saying his job was reorganized as part of routine restructuring. Just before he lost his job, he said, one of his superiors in Washington ordered him not to investigate why Shell Oil had raised its oil transportation costs. Maxwell said it jumped from 90 cents to $3 a barrel without adequate explanation. The government paid Shell to transport oil from offshore platforms. When asked why a government worker would tell an auditor not to investigate, he said: \"I believe it started from the top down,\" he said. Shell Oil told CNN it \"pays the same rate any shipper does\" and that it has \"never engaged in fraudulent transactions or entered into sham contracts as Mr. Maxwell alleges.\" Maxwell, a registered independent, said the shift in attitude at the agency began about seven or eight years ago, about the time the Bush administration came into power. He said he was discouraged from aggressively auditing oil companies. \"Laws and regulations were not applied, also not enforced,\" he said. The inspector general's 27-page summary says that nearly a third of the roughly 60 people in Maxwell's former office received gifts and gratuities from oil industry executives. Two received improper, if not illegal, gifts at least 135 times, the report says. It goes on to describe a wild atmosphere in which some staff members admitted using cocaine and marijuana. In addition, two female workers at the Minerals Management Service were known as the \"MMS chicks\" and both told investigators they had sex with oil industry officials they were supposed to be auditing. One e-mail from a pipeline company representative invited government workers to a tailgating party: \"Have you and the girls meet at my place at 6 a.m. for bubble baths and final prep ... Just kidding.\" Inspector General Earl Devaney said in a letter to Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne accompanying the report that it details \"a textbook example of improperly receiving gifts from prohibited sources.\" Maxwell is now retired from the government and teaches at the University of Hawaii. He said it was just a matter of time until the agency's behavior was exposed. He feels vindicated now in the wake of the inspector general's report, but is still disgusted by what he was happening at the Minerals Management Service. \"Their job is to protect United States taxpayers' interest. It's like they completely forgot that, like they just became part of the oil companies,\" he said. The Interior Department said it could not comment on Maxwell's specific allegations or removal, saying his former supervisor no longer works for the Interior Department either. Kempthorne said he was \"outraged\" by the disclosures in the inspector general's report and that the actions \"of a few has cast a shadow on the entire agency.\" But the department said there is no evidence taxpayers lost money as a result of unethical behavior between government workers and the oil and gas industry. Maxwell doubts that. The former auditor said he'd love to put all the government royalty records under his magnifying glass. \"I think the government should be transparent. We are for the people, by the people. This is the government. We're here to serve,\" he said. Maxwell has filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the Kerr-McGee Corp., an energy company involved in oil and gas exploration. In it, he claims the company defrauded taxpayers out of millions in oil royalty payments. The company denies the accusation. If Maxwell wins, the government would receive about $40 million in additonal revenue and Maxwell would be entitled to about a third of that.", "617fd2aa85a843dec2d605daf7ad3717860c4f70": "ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- A suburban Washington man was bitten Monday by a rattlesnake that found its way into his luggage, a fire department spokesman said. An Eastern diamondback rattlesnake appears in a photo from the U.S. Geological Survey. \"He felt a sharp pain, brought his hand out and saw the bite,\" said Benjamin Barksdale, assistant chief and chief fire marshal of the Arlington County, Virginia, Fire Department. Andrew Bacas zipped his bag shut and called 911 at about 9:30 a.m. ET, the official said. \"He was conscious and alert but a little anxious,\" Barksdale said of the victim. The bite from the young Eastern diamond rattlesnake was not life-threatening, and the man is being treated at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, he said. \"We took the bag outside and used a [carbon dioxide] fire extinguisher to freeze the snake,\" killing it, Barksdale said. Bacas, a high school rowing coach, had been on a six-day trip to Summerton, South Carolina, with about 80 students, said Mike Krulfeld, director of student activities at Yorktown High School in Arlington. Krulfeld said he did not think the incident was a student prank. \"It's been rare to find a coach who is as well-liked and highly regarded as Andy. I would find it hard to believe they would do anything even in the name of a prank that would cause harm to him,\" Krulfeld said. The Web site of the school's crew team warned members to take precautions unpacking from the trip, adding, \"It's advisable to open bags and unpack outdoors.\" \"It got into his bag somehow at the location where they were staying,\" said Kay Speerstra, executive director of the Animal Welfare League of Arlington. \"Nobody noticed it until he was unpacking, and then he definitely noticed it.\" Speerstra said the snake was about 10 inches long and appeared to be a juvenile.

Director Oliver Stone says he believes the timing was right for his upcoming film, \"W.\" Stone, who has endorsed Democratic Sen. Barack Obama for president, seems to thrive on controversy, and his latest foray into filmmaking, \"W.,\" will likely hold true to form. In an interview with CNN's Kiran Chetry, Stone discussed the rationale behind the release date, his troubles securing financing for the film, and why he thinks President Bush's relationship with his father, President George H.W. Bush, played a role in the decision to invade Iraq. Kiran Chetry: We had a chance to see the screening of this movie and I want to ask you a little bit about the timing. This is coming out three weeks before our 2008 presidential election. Why did you want to it come out now? Oliver Stone: Those events are beyond my control. We made the movie as fast as we could starting last May. If I couldn't have completed it, it would have come out in January perhaps for the inauguration. It's not about this election. It's about the last eight years with one man, George W. Bush. It's his story, how he became the man that he is, how we elected him -- basically, if you start to think about it, where we are now as a country.  Watch Stone discuss why he finds Bush \"fascinating\" \u00bb . Chetry: Is it an anti-war movie? Stone: Of course it's an anti-war movie, because I happen to be an anti-war person. That's not to say I'm a pacifist. I believe you fight for the right reasons. This man has us in three wars right now -- Iraq, Afghanistan, and basically, the war on terror. We have a foreign policy which is a very preventive one, a pre-emptive one. It's a Bush doctrine. It's a very dangerous place. Whoever wins the election, Obama or McCain, I think is going to live in the shadow of the events of these last eight years. This man ... will be around, his influence will be felt for 20 years, 40 years. Chetry: What did you want viewers of your movie to come away with? Stone: ... I can't control that. We made the movie to make people think, to make themselves feel, to walk in the shoes of George Bush and to understand him. This is not a job done with malice. This is a fair portrait of the man. I think it's empathetic. You care for him and your feelings for him. An activist said, \"I never thought I could feel something for George Bush. I came out of this movie feeling compassionate for him, and even more important, feeling compassion for our country and where we are now.\" Chetry: You had trouble getting financing because people felt it was too, I guess, sympathetic for the president. Stone: Not for that reason. No, I think that the issues that we had with the American corporations were essentially that it was an inconvenient subject. They thought, he's gone from office, and they don't want to know, and he's controversial, and blah, blah, blah. These are corporations -- large corporations. They're not going to take risks like this. So, the movie business you've got to make movies with risks, and unfortunately, America's moving away from that in all forms, not just movies. Chetry: It's very interesting. You had a soliloquy, a great monologue, by the character playing Vice President Dick Cheney ... about the rationale for Iraq. It was very detailed and it's safe to say you didn't have Dick Cheney's cooperation. Where did you compile some of these scenes, some of these dialogues from those scenes? Stone: [Writer] Stanley Weiser and myself did a lot of research. There's not much known about the first [George W.] Bush administration, the first few years. It's coming out gradually from [\"Price of Loyalty\" author Ron] Suskind and [\"The Bush Tragedy\" author Jacob] Weisburg, and it's coming out gradually. We're finding out about oil and the secret meeting. It is supposition. There are geopolitics involved. There are other issues at stake. We're trying to do justice. We allowed Cheney to speak for himself and [former Defense Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld to speak for himself. And [former Secretary of State Colin] Powell, by the way, is the guy that argues with Cheney in that scene. iReport.com: Will you see 'W.'? Chetry: You say President Bush changed the world. Is it something you believe is permanent? Stone: Put it this way: We have practically an $800 billion Pentagon budget every year. That's a huge amount -- the amount of the bailout right there. Are we going to be in a state of reaction in force for everything that happens? Is it an us-versus-them foreign policy? Of course, I'm very concerned about the Constitution and about the stripping of liberties, torture, Guantanamo. Do you want the whole list? This guy ... he's a disgrace, frankly. And his legacy is going to be a hard one to live down. But I hope we take steps in the positive direction. And I am an optimist. Chetry: Variety's review said Oliver Stone's \"W.\" feels like a rough draft, that it may behoove to make in 10 or 15 years. They say it lacks an ending because we don't have time as perspective. Did we need some more time? Stone: I think the film is quite satisfying in that it shows you the marks for Iraq. It ends at the moment he goes to war. We know how things turn out. It's not a film about those eight years. It's a film about the character of a man. There's a first act when he's in his 20s, a second act in his 40s and the third act when he's in his mid-50s. It's a character study and we get to the place at which we know the way he's going to behave. It's a father-son story because a lot of his actions are motivated by, let's call it, rivalry to be stronger than his father. And that's part of the reason he goes to Iraq.", "8db128b7c4de968670d89ca4fe14aab13d537e3f": "(CNN) -- When news breaks, D.L. Hughley will be ready to mock it. D.L.

Hostages were released Friday after a gunman killed himself in suburban Chicago, police say. The standoff began around 1:30 p.m., after a Wheaton police officer responded to a call of a hit-and-run accident near the bank. When the officer arrived, the suspect grabbed the officer from behind, held a knife to his throat and demanded his gun, Deputy Chief Thomas Meloni said. During an ensuing struggle, the officer was cut on a forearm and the suspect was able to take the gun and run the lobby of the Wheaton Bank & Trust, where he ordered everyone to the floor, Meloni said. Police in Wheaton, about 20 miles west of Chicago, did not immediately release the gunman's identity. As officers evacuated nearby businesses and homes and shut down streets and rail service, hostage negotiators talked to the gunman by phone. They were able to persuade him to release 10 hostages, leaving two behind, Meloni said. \"At one point the suspect began to close the blinds from inside the bank and he disconnected the phone contact with the hostage negotiators,\" Meloni said. Shortly afterward, about 4:15 p.m., officers heard a single gunshot and they rushed in, Meloni said. He said the man was dead of a single gunshot wound to the head. A spokeswoman for Central DuPage Hospital, Amy Steinbruecker, said the hospital treated and released the police officer who scuffled with the suspect for minor injuries.

John McCain, Obama urged top campaign contributors at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan to not be overconfident, despite leading in a number of national polls. A CNN Poll of Polls calculated Wednesday showed him leading 51 percent to 42 percent. \"We've got 19 days,\" Obama said. \"We're going to have to work absolutely as hard as we've ever worked in our lives in order to just to get to the start of what is going to be a very difficult and very challenging but ultimately a very fulfilling four years where we can get this country back on track.\"  Watch more of Obama's comments \u00bb .

Despite the McCain camp's efforts, the Republican National Committee has stopped running advertisements in the state. Palin later traveled to Elon, North Carolina. At an afternoon rally at Elon University, near Greensboro, Palin pressed the audience to stand firm against accusations of negative campaigning, and told them to pay \"close attention\" to Obama's record. \"It's not mean-spirited and it's not negative campaigning when you call someone out on their record,\" she said. \"So don't let anyone, don't let them make you believe that you're being negative or mean-spirited or unpatriotic or unfair when you are asking about somebody's record, OK?\" After the rally, Palin continued on to a fundraiser at a home in Greensboro.

Glenn Beck says Wall Street's troubles began with a wild craze for subprime mortages. NEW YORK (CNN) -- \"Greed is good.\" At least, that's what Michael Douglas' character Gordon Gekko claimed in the movie Wall Street. But, just like Gekko, the modern-day companies that followed that motto now find themselves wondering how everything could collapse so fast. You know the names by now: Countrywide Financial, Bear Stearns, IndyMac, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, AIG. And that's not even counting companies like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and Goldman Sachs that, while still in existence, have lost untold billions in market value and have laid off thousands of employees. Maybe greed isn't so good after all. Lehman was founded in 1844 when Henry Lehman, a German immigrant, opened a small shop in Montgomery, Alabama. His brothers joined him six years later and, by 1858 they were busy turning cotton provided by local farmers into a cash crop -- a business that didn't have anything to do with helping low-income families afford 27-bedroom McMansions. More than 150 years later, after surviving the Great Depression, Black Monday, the savings and loan crisis and the dot-com bust, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection. They had gone 14 years as a public company without ever reporting a single quarterly loss. Now they will never again post a profit. Bear Stearns' story is eerily similar. Founded in 1923. Survived every crisis. Never posted a quarterly loss until last year. Gone without a trace. So how did 235 years of rock-solid American finance disappear virtually overnight? Well, it's not as complicated as you think. If you replace all of the acronyms invented by the brainiacs on Wall Street with references to things that Main Street understands, it becomes a lot easier to see how it all happened. Here's a quick story I invented that does just that. (Note to any Wall Street executives who might be reading this: I know this simple little story isn't perfect, but let's remember that you're the ones who tried to make everything complicated and I'm the one who still has a job.) It's just before Christmas,1996, and as you watch overeager parents trample each other to buy Tickle Me Elmo dolls for their kids, you see an opportunity. \"This isn't a Tickle Me Elmo bubble,\" you think to yourself, \"this is a long-term trend. Every person in America will soon own a Tickle Me Elmo, maybe even two. It's the American dream.\" You approach your local banker about a loan and, naturally, he loves your idea. In fact, he loves it so much that for every $1 you have in your account, he's willing to lend you $34. Great deal, you think, as you max out your credit line and buy as many Tickle Me Elmos as you possibly can. Sales are easy at first. People are lining up to buy your dolls and the prices are going far higher than you ever thought. The only person happier than you is your banker. But the following year something unexpected happens: Kids stop asking for Tickle Me Elmos. You try to cut the price, but no buyers show up. You cut the price more, but your store remains empty. Panic sets in. You're pretty sure that this downturn is just temporary (after all, who wouldn't want a Tickle Me Elmo?) but you're quickly running out of cash. Your only option is to buy time and hope that Tickle Me Elmos start flying off your shelves again. You visit every bank in town and, using your piles of Tickle Me Elmo dolls as collateral (which, of course, you purchased with money you didn't have) you get as much new capital as possible. Soon that money is also gone. Even your friends and family refuse to give you any more loans. At the end of your rope, you go to your town council, which  gives you a \"bridge loan\" to get you through the next few months (something that makes your Furby-selling competitors extremely upset). Unfortunately, no matter how much you borrow, there's still one nagging little problem: No one wants to buy your stupid Tickle Me Elmo dolls anymore. The longer you wait, the less they're worth. You sell some for pennies on the dollar, but pretty soon you can't even do that. Then things get even worse: News breaks that China is poisoning some Tickle Me Elmos before shipping them to the United States. Now your dolls are not just out of favor, they're toxic. You literally can't even give them away. Soon the rest of your money dries up, as do the people who are willing to lend you any more of it. Now you're out of cash; out of a job, and, if not for the pile of poisonous Tickle Me Elmo dolls in your basement, completely alone -- which sounds kind of like the CEOs of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. Believe it or not, this ridiculous story may be far from reality, but it's not that far off from describing what these financial and mortgage companies did to themselves. Just replace the Tickle Me Elmo references with the once popular, then discounted, now completely toxic subprime mortgages and you're pretty much there. When you cut through all the noise about \"bridge loans\" and \"discount windows,\" what you're left with is the fact that too many companies still own way too many Tickle Me Elmos that no one wants to buy. Giving those companies more money doesn't solve anything, it just buys time. Unless and until the underlying problem is fixed, no real turnaround can happen. But we all know that investors (and elected leaders worried about their careers this November) aren't all that patient. That's why the new chorus you're likely to soon hear will be from people arguing that the only way out of this mess is for the federal government to step in and purchase all of the toxic mortgages themselves. That would allow the companies with eyes bigger than their balance sheets to start over, with barely any repercussions whatsoever and without ever taking responsibility for their mistakes. Come to think of it, maybe greed isn't so bad after all. Would the government actually consider that idea? They already are. In fact, the only thing stopping politicians from \"rewarding\" us with a new government agency that will put billions more of our tax dollars at stake is, ironically enough, the election of new politicians.

NEW YORK (CNN) -- The crisis in global financial markets will top the agenda as finance ministers from the world's top industrialized nations and central bank governors meet in Washington. In an effort to breathe some life into economies around the world, the Federal Reserve, in tandem with five other central banks, lowered its key lending rate to 1.5 percent from 2 percent. However, the global financial crisis has sunk its teeth in to the point that analysts say the $700 billion bailout plan and coordinated rate cut were merely steps in the right direction, and it will take much more to really get credit moving. CNN spoke to world affairs expert Fareed Zakaria about the most recent developments. CNN: Is the economy as bad as everyone is saying? Zakaria: What is happening now is a deep, wrenching financial crisis unlike any we've seen since the 1930s. It's contributing to a broad slowdown of the American economy. The pain is spreading across the world. It's ugly. But the history of capitalism is filled with credit crises, panics, financial meltdowns and recessions. It doesn't mean the end of capitalism. CNN: Then why can't we just let the free markets resolve the current economic problems without the federal government getting involved? Zakaria: We just can't accept the downswings that used to be routine for Western countries in the 19th century, when we saw much less intervention by the government. Can you imagine the political fallout from 20 percent unemployment or 5 percent growth rates? The government must experiment with massive interventions in the market to ensure credit starts flowing smoothly again. These interventions have become part and parcel of modern capitalism. CNN: So what should the government do? Zakaria: That is the real question: How to regulate the markets so you get the maximum innovation and growth, but temper their wilder movements? The government will have to do this by trial and error. No one knows in theory what the perfect system would look like. In the short run, whatever it takes, including buying up mortgages, debt, equities. Clearly, America's financial system needs new, different and better regulations for the 21st century, and this crisis should help produce those. CNN: What does it mean for the United States? Zakaria: People around the world once saw the United States as the most modern, sophisticated and productive economy in the world. Now they wonder, was this all a house of cards? They listened to American policymakers with respect, even awe. Today, they wonder if these officials know what they are doing. This loss of credibility will have hard consequences. For decades, the United States has attracted massive amounts of capital -- 80 percent of the surplus savings of the world -- which has allowed it to live beyond its means. That era is drawing to a close. America will have to fight to attract capital and investment like every other nation. CNN: What can we do? Zakaria: We need to wake up and get serious about our challenges. We must address all these issues, and fast -- restore confidence, reform the system, return the country to fiscal sanity.

A nationally syndicated columnist and Chicago-based radio host, Martin has said he will vote for Barack Obama in November. He is the author of \"Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith\" and \"Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America.\" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland Martin says Gov. Sarah Palin talks tough but ducks a lot of difficult questions. (CNN) -- Do you know what was so great about Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Michael Jordan? They were three of the biggest trash talkers in the history of the NBA, but they had the game to back it up. Somebody should tell that to Gov. Sarah Palin. Sen. John McCain's vice presidential running mate has been running around the country, firing up her -- yes, her, and not necessarily McCain's -- loyal supporters by blasting Sen. Barack Obama for \"palling around with terrorists\" and demanding that the American people know exactly when he learned of the past of 1960s radical William Ayers. She has stoked the crowds by saying, \"This is not a man who sees America the way that you and I see America.\" We all know what that is designed to do: Portray Obama as a foreigner who isn't as American as she. Or you. Or Joe Six-pack, the hockey mom, soccer mom, Wal-Mart mom, NASCAR dad and the other coded words she uses regularly. But what is truly pathetic is that Palin talks tough, but is really scared of facing her own issues. Since she is good at proclaiming that the American people need to know who Barack Obama is -- an attempt to paint him as a shady figure who might occupy the White House -- the American people deserve to hear Palin answer if her husband, Todd, a former member of the Alaska Independence Party, agreed with its founder, who wanted to secede from the union. Is there anything more anti-American than wanting to sever ties with the country?  Send Roland Martin your questions and listen to his program on CNNRadio and CNN.com Live, Thursday at noon ET. It's critical that Palin answer questions about whether she disagrees with John McCain's criticism of the Bush administration's decision to remove North Korea from the terrorist nation list. She spoke in favor of it. McCain didn't. Are they on the same page or not? The American people deserve to hear from Palin as to why she didn't say a word to rebuke the hateful, pathetic and degrading comments made at rallies featuring her, such as when someone in the crowd called Obama a terrorist, someone else shouted, \"Off with his head\" and others suggested he is a traitor. Lastly, don't you think the self-described maverick needs to own up to what really happened with the firing of the commissioner in Alaska? She was declared by a special investigator to have been within her rights in firing the commissioner, but she was blasted for abuse of power and violating the state's ethics act. So what did she say in a conference call with Alaska reporters -- who were not allowed by the McCain camp to ask follow-up questions? That she was cleared of all wrongdoing, legally and ethically. That's right. She repeated over and over and over an absolute lie, and we are supposed to say, \"Hey, it's all fine. She winks at us. We love her hockey mom schtick. Don't worry about that abuse of power thing.\" Well, after having to deal with Vice President Dick Cheney being accused of beating the drum for war by berating and pushing our intelligence apparatus to match his political views on Iraq, don't you think we should really care about someone who has been accused in a report, authorized by Democrats and Republicans, of using their power and influence to get their way? Sure, her supporters will say she's talked to the \"media.\" She was questioned by Laura Ingraham, Rush Limbaugh and that self-described journalist -- yes, he really called himself that -- Fox's Sean Hannity. Palin has done interviews with ABC's Charlie Gibson and CBS's Katie Couric, and local TV folks. But why is she so scared of NBC's Brian Williams? And why is she so fearful of CNN? Does she somehow think that our big guns like Wolf Blitzer, Anderson Cooper and Campbell Brown are just too tough in asking questions? My goodness, Tina Fey has actually done more interviews about playing Sarah Palin than Sarah Palin has done about being Sarah Palin! Hmmm. McCain, Sen. Joe Biden, Barack and Michelle Obama, Sen. Hillary Clinton, Cindy McCain and even McCain's 95-year-old momma and Palin's daddy have all done interviews with CNN, sharing their thoughts on the campaign. But Palin? Not a whisper. It's clear that Palin really isn't a true frontier woman. See, when you tote a gun, carry a big stick and spit fire, you aren't afraid to take on all comers. So, Sarah, if you want to talk big on the campaign trail to those audiences that don't talk back, go right ahead. But if you truly are the maverick politician you say you are, come on and talk to us soft, coddled, elitist journalists. Surely we aren't as tough as the moose you like to take down with your Second Amendment-protected hunting rifle.

The leading U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and brokerage Merrill Lynch was the subject of a $50 billion buyout by Bank of America. The fate of other big name financial institutions remained in doubt and stock prices plunged in Asia, Europe and the United States. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 504 points down, or about 4.4 percent. The Nasdaq composite lost 3.6 percent, its worst single-session percentage decline since March 24, 2003. It left the tech-fueled average at its lowest point since March 17 of this year. In Europe, FTSE index in London declined 3.92 percent while the Paris CAC 40 was down 3.78 percent. It was the worst day for the index since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. Major Asian indexes were closed but India's Sensex fell 5.4 percent, Taiwan's benchmark dropped 4.1, Australia's key index dropped 2 percent and Singapore fell 2.9. Check markets . The turmoil at Merrill Lynch and Lehman is bound to mean job losses in the already hard-hit financial services industry, but so far neither company has indicated how many will be cut. \"This crisis is clearly deeper than anybody had imagined only a short time ago,\" Peter Stein, an associate editor at the Wall Street Journal in Asia, told CNN. The chaos followed a roller-coaster weekend for a Wall Street already concussed by woes at other major financial firms and mortgage-financing titans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Sound off: What do you think? At one point the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to step in, announcing plans to loosen lending restrictions to the banking industry in an effort to calm markets, while a consortium of 10 leading domestic and foreign banks agreed a $70 billion fund to lend to troubled financial firms. U.S. President George W. Bush said Monday he is confident that the markets are resilient and can deal with the latest financial blows. \"We are working to reduce disruptions and minimize the impact these financial market developments on the broader economy.\"  Watch what went wrong \u00bb . He added: \"In the short run, adjustments in the financial markets can be painful for people worried about their investments and for employees of the firms.\" U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said eight years of Bush \"brought us the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression.\" His Republican rival said John McCain said he was happy the federal government decided not to use taxpayer dollars to bail out Lehman Brothers. In an effort to calm market jitters, the European Central Bank on Monday said it has pumped $42.6 billion into money markets. The Bank of England in London also took steps, offering nearly $9 billion in a three-day auction. In another development, American International Group, the world's largest insurer, was reportedly struggling to secure billions of dollars in capital after months of seeing its share values slide. Police cordoned off Lehman's headquarters in New York on Sunday as staff, some in suits, others in casual clothes, left the building with cardboard boxes while tourists and onlookers gathered to watch the spectacle. The 158-year-old bank, which has weathered previous financial upheavals and saw its offices destroyed in the September 11 World Trade Center attacks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which grants protection while it works out a plan to pay back creditors. The collapse of Lehman came after shares declined 94 percent in the space of a year, prompting speculation over its fate. It took a turn for the worse Sunday when Bank of America and British bank Barclays, both viewed as potential \"white knights,\" pulled out of deal talks, sources told CNNMoney.com. Both Lehmans and Merrill have been caught with huge exposures to unsecured mortgages, the bad debts at the heart of the so-called credit crunch that has devalued the U.S. housing market and sent financial shockwaves worldwide. Analysis: Different rules for different names \u00bb . Lehman's collapse and the sale of Merrill reduces the number of independent firms on Wall Street to two -- Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs -- following the sale of Bear Stearns to JP Morgan at a bargain price earlier this year. \"Acquiring one of the premier wealth management, capital markets and advisory companies is a great opportunity for our shareholders,\" Bank of American Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Lewis said in a statement Monday. \"Together our companies are more valuable because of the synergies in our businesses.\" Like Lehman, Merrill Lynch has been suffering from bad real estate bets, and its stock price lost 27 percent last week -- shares are down 65 percent this year.  Watch why Bank of America thinks Merrill is the opportunity of a lifetime \u00bb . Merrill, known for with its famous bull logo, has been an icon of Wall Street and investing. But billions of dollars in losses in the last year due to fallout in the U.S. mortgage market proved too much for the 94-year old firm.

He was the author of a report last month by the organization's commission on the use of standardized tests. David Hawkins says test scores shouldn't be used to rank college quality . ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- A recent controversy at Baylor University has brought new attention to the widespread misuse of standardized college admission tests to rank the quality of America's colleges and universities. The SAT and ACT have achieved nearly iconic status in America and throughout the world. As the late author and scholar Stephen Jay Gould noted, the tests are viewed by many as \"abstruse and mysterious,\" with powerful effects on public policy, social mobility, and even individual identity. Misuse of test scores as college ranking criteria creates undue pressure on admission offices to pursue increasingly high test scores and fuels the tests' disproportionate influence. Last June, Baylor University encouraged its already admitted first-year students to retake the SAT. The reward for students who retook the test was $300 in bookstore credits. Students who increased their score by more than 50 points got a $1,000 merit aid scholarship. If enough students retook the SAT and increased their scores, the gains might be enough to move Baylor up the rankings list. The scarce financial resources allocated for this plan are too badly needed elsewhere, particularly among low-income students in rural and urban areas around the country, to spend on an effort to raise a college's SAT profile. A Baylor spokesman told The Associated Press Thursday that the university \"goofed\" and would likely end the incentives. It's critical to understand that high SAT and ACT scores alone do not equate to merit. Last month, our organization's Commission on the Use of Standardized Tests in Undergraduate Admission issued a report calling for change in the way everyone involved in college admissions uses the tests. Test misuses feed the public perception that the scores are the most influential factor in college admission. For the past 15 years, National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC) research has shown that students' grades in high school, particularly grades in college preparatory courses, are by far the most important consideration in college admission decisions. One of the most pressing problems regarding the SAT and ACT scores is their misuse in the U.S. News and World Report college rankings formula. The SAT and ACT were designed to provide information about a student to colleges and universities and were never meant to be measures of college quality. Accordingly, the commission encouraged U.S. News and World Report to eliminate test scores as a measure of institutional quality. The U.S. News ranking formula includes a \"student selectivity\" score that constitutes 15 percent of a college's overall rank. SAT or ACT scores of enrollees make up 50 percent of the student selectivity score. In response to the NACAC report, U.S. News and World Report said, \"As long as standardized tests play an integral role in the college admissions process, U.S. News will use them as part of our ranking methodology.\" The situation at Baylor is a reminder of the inflated value assigned to the SAT and ACT in higher education. The fervor surrounding the rankings, as well as the lengths to which colleges go to increase them, are unfortunate distractions in higher education and admissions. The impression students and families get from the rankings is that higher test scores mean higher quality colleges. To borrow a phrase familiar to admission deans, many colleges recruit great students and then graduate great students. Is that because of the institution, or the students? Some credit undoubtedly should go to both. But is a college of lower quality because its students' SAT scores are lower than those of students at another college? Generally speaking, the ability of admission tests to predict success in higher education is much more limited than most people think. Colleges most often determine the utility of admission test scores by assessing how well they predict first-year grades. Colleges are wrong to place so much emphasis on test scores as measurements of their institutional worth when admission offices across the board consider the scores to be one among many indicators of a student's merit. As influential as the rankings have been with students and families, is it any wonder that colleges whose stakeholders often demand higher ranks go to such lengths to influence their position in the rankings? Misuse of test scores has real ramifications for students and families. For every student able to afford test-performance tutoring and fees for taking the test many times, there are many qualified students from under-served backgrounds who become discouraged that they will be unable to compete. For every college that raises its SAT or ACT profile for rankings purposes, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of qualified students who will never apply because artificially inflated test scores signal yet another barrier to higher education. It is critical to re-evaluate the varied uses of admission tests, and protect against their misuse in all forms.

As part of the Kashubian minority living in the Gdansk Region, he was born to working-class parents -- his father a carpenter and his mother a nurse. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected in November 2007. As a student of History at the University of Gdansk in the late 1970s, a period of growing discontent with the Communist regime in Poland, he became actively involved in the creation of the opposition Students' Solidarity Committee. This was founded in reaction to the murder of student activist Stanislaw Pyjas by the State Security Service. Despite his anti-communist activities, he successfully finished his studies in 1980 and joined the Independent Solidarity Trade Union movement. When the Communists imposed martial law in 1981 he continued with his underground activities, writing pamphlets about the ideas of liberal economist Friedrich Hayek and the concept of private property. His heroes became former U.S. president Ronald Reagan and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. With the fall of Communism in 1989, the Solidarity Movement splintered. Lech Walesa, the former Solidarity Leader was elected President, while Tusk went on to co-found the KLD (Liberal and Democratic Congress Party) with other well-known figures. The Party stood for among other things: free market economy, privatization, individual freedom of Polish citizens and Polish accession to the EU. The following year, during the 1991 Parliamentary elections, the KLD won 37 seats in the lower house of the Polish Parliament. Not being able to follow up on their success in the 1993 elections, the KLD merged with the larger Democratic Union Party (UD) to form a new party called Freedom Union (UW). Tusk soon became Deputy Chairman and in the 1997 elections, he was voted into the Senate. In 2001, Tusk formed the Civic Platform Party (PO), winning seats in that year's parliamentary elections and becoming Deputy Speaker in parliament. But the Civic Platform was not able to sustain its success in the 2005 elections. Tusk and his party lost both the presidential and parliamentary elections to Lech Kacczynski's PiS (Law and Justice Party). This setback was not to last as Tusk triumphed over Jaroslaw Kaczynsky's PiS in the October 2007 elections and became prime minister of Poland. Tusk's economic policies are pro-business: less bureaucratic hurdles and state interference making it easier for entrepreneurs to start businesses. He is also trying to woo back more than a million Poles who left the country to work in other European Union countries after it joined the EU in 2004. Tusk is a keen footballer, viewed in his youth as a promising striker. He is married to historian Malgorzata and has two children, Kasia and Michal.", "843235a2f727c26c82f801d44daf764328a40259": "(Coastal Living) -- Barefoot on the sandy shore of Catalina Island, Kim Francis shades her eyes from the sun and peers back to mainland California. \"I can't believe we're 22 miles from Los Angeles,\" she says, grinning. \"I may never go back.\" Paddlers can experience Catalina from the water's surface.

A few strokes of the paddle separate kayakers from pelicans, sea lions and a bison, which watches from land. \"If his tail wags, the buffalo is in a good mood,\" says Rod Jackson, who helps run Hummer tours to see bison. \"But never get too close.\" The bison have been on the island since the 1920s, when they were brought in as film extras. Today, they number nearly 250 and are protected by the Catalina Island Conservancy. \"Sometimes we get a rebel,\" Jackson says, gesturing to a lone bison across from the area's only inn, The Banning House Lodge. Free hiking permits allow visitors to wander the island at will. Adrenaline junkies will want to tackle Boushay Trail, which climbs 1,800 feet to Silver Peak, the highest point west of Two Harbors.

Read his column here. Ruben Navarrette asks whether Obama's cool, calm demeanor will be a plus in negotiating with world leaders. SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Make no mistake, Barack Obama is one cool customer. Now, after the last debate, it seems all but certain that the Iceman cometh to the White House. Radio talk show hosts and rank-and-file Republicans spent the last few weeks pleading with John McCain to take the gloves off and take the fight to Obama. How's that working out, folks? In this week's match-up, Obama snatched the gloves out of McCain's hands and slapped him silly with them. I suppose the hope was that Obama would get rattled and make a mistake. But Obama doesn't get rattled or make many mistakes. I still have no idea what type of president Obama would make. But he's an extraordinary politician. In fact, he may even be better than Bill Clinton who, while he had the IQ and EQ, also had the burden of a legendary red-hot temper. Obviously, it takes a lot to get under Obama's skin. McCain sure tried. Maybe this is the guy we want negotiating with world leaders. Maybe after eight years of George W. Bush stubbornness, on the heels of eight years of Clinton emotiveness, we need to send out for ice. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, 58 percent of those who watched the debate said Obama did the better job and 31 percent said that about McCain. That makes three skins for Obama. In earlier polls, 54 percent of those who watched thought Obama won the second debate, and 51 percent thought he won the first one. This week, McCain turned in his best performance of the debates, and the first 30 minutes -- with McCain bringing up Obama's problematic encounter with the now famous Joe the Plumber; and the quip about how he isn't Bush and how Obama should have run four years ago -- were near flawless for the Republican.  iReport.com: Are you Joe the Plumber? Get out your plunger and share your thoughts . McCain put Obama on the defensive, and it showed. If McCain had been that aggressive throughout the first two debates -- firm but not necessary unlikable -- we might be looking at a different race right now. But, over the next hour, Obama regained his stride and eventually dominated the exchange.  And, in the end, with his sarcastic crack about school vouchers -- \"Because there's not enough vouchers; therefore, we shouldn't do it, even though it's working. I got it.\" -- McCain was profoundly unlikable. So said the polls. In the CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, 70 percent of debate watchers found Obama more likable. Only 22 percent said that about McCain. McCain's supporters wanted him to bring up some of the allegedly shady characters from Obama's circle of acquaintances that give some Americans pause and lead them to question the Democrat's values. There are good reasons to have that conversation, and bad ones. A friend and fellow journalist told me Obama's Chicago posse was important because it formed \"the political womb where the fetal Obama grew into a politician. ... That tells us who he is and what either he believes himself or is at least willing to tolerate as president.\" Frankly, that argument makes a lot more sense than what many of the Obama haters are saying about how these \"Friends of Barack\" prove he is a couple of flag pins short of being a full-blooded American. That's nonsense. For instance, with William Ayers -- the unrepentant domestic terrorist who Obama first claimed was just a guy who lived in his neighborhood but with whom we now know the Illinois senator had a more substantial relationship --  the issue isn't Obama's patriotism but his truthfulness. Still, it was obviously a mistake for McCain to bring up Ayers during the debate. The tactic backfired. In the CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, 62 percent of debate watchers said Obama's connection to Ayers mattered to them \"not much\" or \"not at all.\" Only 23 percent said it mattered \"a great deal.\" McCain should leave it to the press to mine the question of whether Obama has been totally honest about his relationship with Ayers -- well, at least those in the press who haven't already sent in requests for tickets to the Barack Obama inaugural ball. As for McCain, he is an American hero who has given his life to public service, and the country is better for it. That record of service need not come to an end. He can still contribute and finish out his term in the Senate. But, unless the political wind changes -- and quickly -- a promotion to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue doesn't appear to be in the cards.

Claude Monet's \"Poppies near Vetheuil\" has been recovered by Swiss police. The Monet and van Gogh oil paintings were in good condition, police said, and the search continued for the other two -- a Cezanne and a Degas. A parking lot attendant at the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zurich found the paintings Monday afternoon in the back of an unlocked white car, police said. It was not clear how long the car, an Opel Omega with stolen license plates, had been parked on the lot, police said. \"The two paintings, worth about 70 million francs($64 million), are in good condition and are still protected by the original glass covering,\" police said in a statement. Three masked men stole the four paintings in what police called a \"spectacular\" heist Feb. 11 at the E.G. Buhrle Collection -- among the finest collections of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art in the world. One of the men threatened personnel at the museum's front door with a pistol and forced them to the ground, police said, while the other two men went into an exhibition room and stole four oil paintings by Paul Cezanne, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh. Afterward, the three men loaded the paintings into a white car parked in front of the museum and then drove off, police said. The paintings recovered Monday are Monet's \"Poppies near Vetheuil\" and van Gogh's \"Blossoming Chestnut Branches.\" Still missing are Degas' \"Count Lepic and his Daughters\" and Cezanne's \"Boy in a Red Vest.\" The four paintings are worth a total of about $163 million (180 million Swiss francs). A reward of $91,000 (100,00 Swiss francs) has been posted for information leading to the return of the paintings, police said. A Zurich police task force, which includes an art expert, had received tips from around the world, police said. The task force was looking into possible connections with other art thefts inside Switzerland and abroad. The Zurich heist followed the recent theft in Switzerland of two paintings by Pablo Picasso, said Bjoern Quellenberg, a spokesman for the Kunsthaus, another major art museum in Zurich. The director of the Kunsthaus serves on the E.G. Buhrle private art foundation's council, Quellenberg said. In that theft, thieves stole the 1962 \"Tete de Cheval\" (\"Horse's Head\") and the 1944 \"Verre et Pichet\" (\"Glass and Pitcher\") by Picasso. They were on loan from a German museum and valued at $4.5 million when they were stolen February 6, according to news reports.

Stiglitz, professor at Columbia University, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001 for his work on the economics of information and was on the climate change panel that shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008. Stiglitz, a supporter of Barack Obama, was a member and later chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration before joining the World Bank as chief economist and senior vice president. He is the co-author with Linda Bilmes of the \"Three Trillion Dollar War: The True Costs of the Iraq Conflict.\" Economist Joseph Stiglitz says federal regulators and executives helped create the Wall Street crisis. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Many seem taken aback by the depth and severity of the current financial turmoil. I was among several economists who saw it coming and warned about the risks. There is ample blame to be shared; but the purpose of parsing out blame is to figure out how to make a recurrence less likely. President Bush famously said, a little while ago, that the problem is simple: Too many houses were built. Yes, but the answer is too simplistic: Why did that happen? One can say the Fed failed twice, both as a regulator and in the conduct of monetary policy. Its flood of liquidity (money made available to borrow at low interest rates) and lax regulations led to a housing bubble. When the bubble broke, the excessively leveraged loans made on the basis of overvalued assets went sour. For all the new-fangled financial instruments, this was just another one of those financial crises based on excess leverage, or borrowing, and a pyramid scheme. The new \"innovations\" simply hid the extent of systemic leverage and made the risks less transparent; it is these innovations that have made this collapse so much more dramatic than earlier financial crises. But one needs to push further: Why did the Fed fail? First, key regulators like Alan Greenspan didn't really believe in regulation; when the excesses of the financial system were noted, they called for self-regulation -- an oxymoron. Second, the macro-economy was in bad shape with the collapse of the tech bubble. The tax cut of 2001 was not designed to stimulate the economy but to give a largesse to the wealthy -- the group that had been doing so well over the last quarter-century. The coup d'grace was the Iraq War, which contributed to soaring oil prices. Money that used to be spent on American goods now got diverted abroad. The Fed took seriously its responsibility to keep the economy going. It did this by replacing the tech bubble with a new bubble, a housing bubble. Household savings plummeted to zero, to the lowest level since the Great Depression. It managed to sustain the economy, but the way it did it was shortsighted: America was living on borrowed money and borrowed time. Finally, at the center of blame must be the financial institutions themselves. They -- and even more their executives -- had incentives that were not well aligned with the needs of our economy and our society. They were amply rewarded, presumably for managing risk and allocating capital, which was supposed to improve the efficiency of the economy so much that it justified their generous compensation. But they misallocated capital; they mismanaged risk -- they created risk. They did what their incentive structures were designed to do: focusing on short-term profits and encouraging excessive risk-taking. This is not the first crisis in our financial system, not the first time that those who believe in free and unregulated markets have come running to the government for bail-outs. There is a pattern here, one that suggests deep systemic problems -- and a variety of solutions: . 1. We need first to correct incentives for executives, reducing the scope for conflicts of interest and improving shareholder information about dilution in share value as a result of stock options. We should mitigate the incentives for excessive risk-taking and the short-term focus that has so long prevailed, for instance, by requiring bonuses to be paid on the basis of, say, five-year returns, rather than annual returns. 2. Secondly, we need to create a financial product safety commission, to make sure that products bought and sold by banks, pension funds, etc. are safe for \"human consumption.\" Consenting adults should be given great freedom to do whatever they want, but that does not mean they should gamble with other people's money. Some may worry that this may stifle innovation. But that may be a good thing considering the kind of innovation we had -- attempting to subvert accounting and regulations. What we need is more innovation addressing the needs of ordinary Americans, so they can stay in their homes when economic conditions change. 3. We need to create a financial systems stability commission to take an overview of the entire financial system, recognizing the interrelations among the various parts, and to prevent the excessive systemic leveraging that we have just experienced. 4. We need to impose other regulations to improve the safety and soundness of our financial system, such as \"speed bumps\" to limit borrowing. Historically, rapid expansion of lending has been responsible for a large fraction of crises and this crisis is no exception. 5. We need better consumer protection laws, including laws that prevent predatory lending. 6. We need better competition laws. The financial institutions have been able to prey on consumers through credit cards partly because of the absence of competition. But even more importantly, we should not be in situations where a firm is \"too big to fail.\" If it is that big, it should be broken up. These reforms will not guarantee that we will not have another crisis. The ingenuity of those in the financial markets is impressive. Eventually, they will figure out how to circumvent whatever regulations are imposed. But these reforms will make another crisis of this kind less likely, and, should it occur, make it less severe than it otherwise would be.

Shiite demonstrators protest a proposed U.S.-Iraqi security pact Saturday in Baghdad. All other crimes -- including murders committed inside U.S. facilities or by on-duty forces -- would fall under American jurisdiction, according to the draft, which would govern U.S. troops' presence in Iraq. The issue of whether U.S. troops would remain immune from Iraqi prosecution has been a sticky one for negotiators crafting the Status of Forces Agreement draft, which Iraqi lawmakers are reviewing. The United States had preferred its troops and contractors retain immunity. The draft also calls for U.S. combat troops to be out of Iraqi cities by July 30, 2009, and out of the country entirely by December 31, 2011. The agreement allows for an earlier withdrawal or an extension of the U.S. forces' stay in Iraq, by agreement of both parties. It also allows the Iraqi government to \"request from the United States government to leave certain forces for training and for support purposes for the Iraqi forces.\" The governments have been trying to get a deal before December 31, when a U.N. mandate authorizing the U.S. troop presence in Iraq expires. Iraq's ruling Shiite parliamentary bloc said Sunday it needs more time before it can approve the draft. The United Iraqi Alliance bloc found several \"points\" in the draft that \"need more time for discussion, dialogue and amendments [to] some of its articles,\" according to the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq, the most powerful party in the bloc. It was unclear what specific \"points\" the parliamentary bloc was questioning. Thousands of people marched in central Baghdad on Saturday to protest the draft U.S.-Iraqi security agreement. The political party of Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr called for the rally.  Watch marchers protest the agreement \u00bb . Baghdad had sought the power to arrest and try Americans accused of crimes that are not related to official military operations, plus jurisdiction over troops and contractors who commit grave mistakes in the course of their duties. The United Iraqi Alliance on Sunday night discussed the draft, which was presented by Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, whose Dawa Party is also a member of the ruling bloc. Iraq's Political Council for National Security needs to approve the draft before al-Maliki sends it to his cabinet. The council includes the leaders of various political blocs -- including the United Iraqi Alliance -- as well as Iraq's president, prime minister, vice presidents, and speaker of parliament. If the cabinet passes the draft by a two-thirds majority, al-Maliki will submit it to the Iraqi parliament for approval. A senior Bush administration official said last week that the U.S. is examining \"contingencies\" in case the Iraqi government is unable to sell the status-of-forces deal to the country's various factions. If Iraq does not approve the deal, fallback options include \"a new U.N. Security Council resolution legally authorizing the extension of the U.S. footprint\" or an \"informal agreement between the United States and the Iraqis,\" the official told CNN last week. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions. Other points covered in the draft agreement include Iraqi ownership of \"all the buildings, facilities and structures that cannot be transported and are connected to the ground\" and used by American forces. Such facilities will be returned to Iraq when the agreement expires, it says. Further, the agreement requires the United States to immediately return to Iraq any \"historic or cultural site\" it discovers at facilities it is using. The agreement allows the United States to use whatever defensive systems it deems necessary in areas under its control. Yet it bars \"systems of weapons of mass destruction (chemical, nuclear, radiological, biological weapons and waste related to these weapons).\" The United States is to transfer control of Iraqi airspace to Iraq when the agreement goes into effect, although Iraq can ask for assistance for airspace control and surveillance. The agreement also covers environmental issues; the comings and goings of troops in and out of Iraq; movement of vehicles, planes and ships; and the movement of equipment in and out of Iraq. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is lobbying Iraqi leaders to pass the draft text of the agreement by the end of the year, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said last week.", "66aaf0fe331b60d0d461a586fde9f74e451f739e": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Thousands of people marched in central Baghdad on Saturday to protest a proposed U.S.-Iraqi security agreement that would extend the presence of U.S. troops in the country after the end of the year. Thousands staged a mass march through Baghdad, Iraq, on Saturday to protest a planned U.S.-Iraq security deal. The political party of Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr called for the rally. At one point, several speakers at a podium addressed the mass of people, urging the Iraqi government to reject the proposal. \"End the U.S. occupation of Iraq!\" one speaker shouted in English. Hazem al-Araji, a senior al-Sadr aide, told protesters their voices would be heard in America. \"Thanks to you, to these voices and the millions of voices, George Bush will hear these millions of calls in his 'Black House' -- in which you shouted out, 'No, no, America!'\" he said.

This voice does not reach the Green Zone. We want to hear everyone who is occupied in that area saying Baghdad is free, free, America get out!\" al-Araji exclaimed. Protesters clogged several streets in the capital, waving Iraqi flags and kicking up dust. The demonstration, the largest in Baghdad in several months, was largely peaceful. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said in Washington on Thursday a draft status-of-forces agreement authorizing the U.S. troop presence in Iraq had \"been agreed upon by U.S. and Iraqi negotiators\" and was being reviewed by the two governments. A U.N. mandate authorizing the U.S. troop presence in Iraq expires December 31, and U.S. officials are examining \"contingencies\" in case the Iraqi government is unable to sell the status-of-forces deal to the country's various factions, a senior Bush administration official said this week. The same official said negotiations on the pact had finished and the text was final. The official said the \"final\" draft calls for U.S. troops to be out of Iraqi cities by June 2009 and out of Iraq by the end of 2011 unless the Iraqis ask the United States to stay. The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions, said negotiators had also \"reached a compromise\" on the issue of U.S. troops remaining immune from Iraqi law -- an issue that was a major hurdle in the talks.

Barack Obama calls a prospective voter from a headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri, on Saturday. In a campaign video, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said a record 632,000 new donors gave to the campaign, with the average contribution under $100. More than 3 million donors have given so far. The Obama campaign raised $65 million in August. Regardless of the stunning haul, Plouffe told supporters the campaign still needed more money because of \"the slime that we're getting from the McCain campaign.\" Plouffe cited recent attack ads and automated phone calls in battleground states and said the campaign needed to have every resource to \"fight back.\" \"Their campaign is going to descend even more into the gutter,\" he said. Plouffe also said the campaign was expanding its reach to compete \"aggressively\" in West Virginia. Tightening polls in Georgia and North Dakota meant more money and resources could be sent to those two states in the remaining days, he said. \"We can't afford to make any cuts. We have to execute everything we think is required to win,\" Plouffe said of their battleground strategy. \"None of us can look back on the night of November 4 or the morning of November 5 and wished we had done something extra.\" The McCain campaign accepted $85 million in federal matching funds for the last two months of the campaign.

Elegant space: the interior of the proposed Virgin Galactic spaceport in New Mexico . In fact, when discussing the future of the airport it is now appropriate to consider both conventional air travel hubs we are familiar with, as well as the imminent 'spaceports'. The rush of interest in setting up 'space tourism' companies has seen proposed spaceport projects in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, and California, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Florida, Virginia, Alaska and Wisconsin in the United States. Russia, Australia, Sweden and Portugal have also been rumored as potential spaceport locations. Meanwhile, the air travel industry is continuing to expand operations despite the challenges facing some airlines. And there are some radical new ideas being developed for future air and spaceports.  See a picture gallery of futuristic airport and spaceport designs \u00bb . The adventurous views of Dave Evans, chief technologist at business solutions company Cisco Systems, highlight the types of changes we could soon see in airports and indeed the new features we may witness in spaceports. Speaking at a FAA/NASA/Industry Airport Planning Workshop in 2006, Evans suggested that pilots of the future could fly without hands and from the comfort of their own home (using brain-machine interfaces, in which the human brain actually exchanges electronic signals with a computer). He also said future airports would have virtual intelligence personnel to perform the jobs of many airport workers; and that people would be able to check-in remotely using a cell phone embedded with a RFID (radio frequency identification) chip. But what will these new airports and spaceports look like? Graeme Johns, who is an architect at British airport design company, The Design Solution, believes airports of the future will continue to expand, with bigger security and commercial areas. Johns, who is involved in projects in London (the new Heathrow T2 terminal), Delhi, Mumbai, Doha, Abu Dhabi and Oman, said many new airports were being more adventurous with designs. \"I think there is definitely a move towards more avant-garde designs. People are trying to do things more site-specific rather than keeping to the same old formula. \"Definitely in the Middle East they throw everything at it, also in the Far East there are some large developments. They are all vying for transit passages,\" he said. Johns said one of the biggest challenges was balancing commercial space with operational space. \"There's lots of pressure to make larger security areas ... but a big thing for us is trying to move up the commercial side of airports.\" Future airports would likely include a better range of shops, he said. \"We are definitely looking at broadening the offering of shops and bringing in things that haven't traditionally been in airports,\" John said. If all of this isn't exciting enough for you -- then of course there are spaceports. Internationally renowned design company Foster and Partners won a competition to build Virgin Galactic's spaceport in New Mexico. Company founder Lord Norman Foster said the project was one of the most exciting and futuristic he had been involved in . \"This technically complex building will not only provide a dramatic experience for the astronauts and visitors, but will set an ecologically sound model for future spaceport facilities.\" And what will this magnificent new structure include? A tunneled entrance, a 'super-hangar' for the space-craft, and retaining walls that form an exhibition documenting the history of space exploration alongside the story of the region, are just some of the features. So whether or not you have the money to make the space flight, Virgin Galactic's spaceport is going to be a place well worth visiting.", "fbfd0a64e822f8b39464dba08b31826164837fbc": "JOHNSTOWN, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin charged into the culture wars Saturday in Pennsylvania, painting Sen. Barack Obama as a radical on abortion rights. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin speaks at a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Saturday. The stop comes amid news that Palin violated Alaska ethics law by trying to get her former brother-in-law fired from the state police, a state investigator's report for the bipartisan Legislative Council concluded Friday. Ethics woes aside, Palin focused her attention on abortion -- an issue that rallies the conservative base but some say alienates independent and women voters. \"In times like these with wars and financial crisis, I know that it may be easy to forget even as deep and abiding a concern as the right to life, and it seems that our opponent kind of hopes you will forget that,\" Palin told a crowd in Johnstown. \"He hopes that you won't notice how radical, absolutely radical his idea is on this, and his record is, until it's too late.\" Palin has mostly avoided raising her opposition to abortion rights on the campaign trail since she was tapped as Sen. John McCain's running mate, a fact she readily acknowledged in her remarks.  Watch more of Palin's views on abortion \u00bb . But Palin said Obama's record on the matter is too extreme to be ignored, and she spent 10 minutes of her 30-minute speech discussing abortion. \"A vote for Barack Obama is a vote for activist courts that will continue to smother the open and democratic debate that we deserve and that we need on this issue of life,\" she said. \"Obama is a politician who has long since left behind even the middle ground on the issue of life.\" Obama opposes any constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade and disagreed with Supreme Court ruling to uphold the \"Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.\" He did not cast a vote on Prohibiting Funds for Groups that Perform Abortions amendment in 2007. Palin opposes abortion in all cases, including rape and incest, except when a mother's life is in danger, and said she believes Roe v. Wade should be overturned and the decision given to the states. McCain voted for the Prohibit Partial Birth Abortion bill in 2003 and \"yes\" for Prohibiting Funds for Groups that Perform Abortions amendment in 2007. He believes Roe v. Wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned, and also supports the Supreme Court ruling upholding the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. Palin also talked about a remark Obama made about sex education while campaigning in Johnstown in March, when he told a voter he didn't want his daughters \"punished with a baby\" or \"punished with an STD\" if they were not educated about sex and made a mistake. \"So I listened when our opponent defended his unconditional support for unlimited abortions and he said he said that a woman shouldn't have to be 'Punished with a baby,' \" Palin said as the audience jeered at Obama. \"Ladies and gentlemen, he said that right here in Johnstown. 'Punished with a baby.' It's about time we called him on it.\" Obama is also in Pennsylvania Saturday -- campaigning in the heavily Democratic city of Philadelphia. During his four-stop swing around the city, Obama acknowledged McCain's efforts to \"tone down the rhetoric\" on the campaign trail. \"I appreciated his reminder that we can disagree while still being respectful of each other. I've said it before, and I'll say it again -- Sen. McCain has served this country with honor, and he deserves our thanks for that,\" Obama told an early morning crowd assembled in the northern part of the city.  Watch more of Obama's comments \u00bb . Ever since last weekend, when Palin first accused Obama of \"palling around with a terrorist,\" referring to 1960s radical William Ayers, rowdy crowds have called Obama a liar, terrorist and worse.

Watch McCain tell voters not to be afraid of Obama \u00bb . But the Arizona senator was met by a sea of boos when asking the crowd to be more respectful toward Obama. When the crowd began to boo, McCain told them \"No, no. I want everyone to be respectful.\" Obama later dispensed with polite talk and pivoted to his main campaign trail argument that McCain is out of touch on the economy. \"Sen. McCain's campaign manager actually said that Sen. McCain wasn't talking about the market because there's just not much a candidate for president can say -- and they aren't sure what he'd say each day even if he did talk about it,\" Obama said. \"But here's the thing Philadelphia.

Thaksin Shinawatra lives in self-imposed exile in London. The case stemmed from a Bangkok land deal while Thaksin was in office. He was convicted of violating a law that bans ministers or their wives from conducting business with government agencies. Thaksin, who now lives in the United Kingdom, is unlikely to serve any jail time. He fled from Thailand in August just as he was to appear in court. In the land deal, Thaksin's wife, Pojama, is accused of using her husband's political influence to buy undeveloped land from a government agency for about a third of its estimated value.  Watch more about the verdict \u00bb . The case is one of several corruption cases against Thaksin and his family that are winding their way through the legal system. The billionaire is accused of abusing the country's system of checks and balances and bending government policy to benefit his family's business. Thaksin has consistently denied that he or his family was involved in any wrongdoing. In August, Thaksin and his wife skipped a court appearance and fled to the United Kingdom rather than testify in the real-estate case. He said he did so because he did not think he would get a fair trial in Thailand. Thaksin, a telecommunications tycoon, once owned the English Premier League Manchester City Football Club but sold his stake this year. His party won two landslide victories before he was deposed in a bloodless military coup in September 2006 after massive anti-government street protests. He returned to Thailand after his allies in the People Power Party won nearly half the seats in the lower house in December's parliamentary elections and formed the ruling coalition. In recent weeks, the country has seen daily demonstrations from anti-government protesters who want PPP leaders purged from the Cabinet. They have laid siege to the Government House -- the seat of the Thai government -- since August 26. The protesters -- led by the People's Alliance for Democracy -- contend that the PPP is trying to amend the constitution so Thaksin does not have to face charges. In September, Thailand's Constitutional Court stripped then-Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej of his position, ruling that he had violated the constitution by appearing as a paid guest on a television cooking show. The PPP responded by picking Thaksin's brother-in-law as Samak's replacement -- further inflaming the protesters.

Two people remained in grave condition, said Roman Armando Luna Escalante, secretary of health in Michoacan state. Eleven of the wounded were children, Luna Escalante said. None of them are gravely injured. The explosions occurred around 11 p.m. near the governor's residence in Morelia, the capital of Michoacan. The second blast happened shortly afterward a few blocks away. Officials would not say if they have any suspects or if any group has claimed responsibility. Some experts pointed to drug cartels or insurgents. \"It could be a warning to the federal government, which has put a lot of money and manpower to deal with drugs, which are very powerful there,\" said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank on Western Hemisphere affairs. \"It could be leftist guerrilla groups that occasionally throw a bomb. \"The problem is that this is part of a real wave of violence that is consuming Mexico.\" Last week the bodies of 24 people, bound and shot execution-style, were found in Atlapulco, a town just south of Mexico City. Those killings Friday came roughly two weeks after tens of thousands of Mexicans marched on the nation's capital, calling for greater government action against the wave of violent crime.

In late August, Mexican President Felipe Calderon met with the country's 32 governors to develop a plan to battle the rise in violent crime.

Harald Scheucher, mayor of Klagenfurt, speaks in front of the coffin of Joerg Haider Saturday. Among those attending the service at the town's central Neuen Platz square were Austrian President Heinz Fischer and Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer. Haider's widow sat in the front row with her two daughters, all of them dressed in black. \"Many people expected things of Joerg Haider that they themselves weren't able to fulfill, and he too expected things of people that he wasn't able to fulfill,\" Gusenbauer said at the funeral. \"Therefore his death, and the end of his life, may be a time to think about whether death's only consolation is that we can now reconcile things that seemed irreconcilable during his lifetime.\" Haider's coffin was draped in the yellow, red and white flag of the southern state of Carinthia, where he was governor, and topped with red roses. Haider, 58, died last Saturday in a car accident while driving out of Klagenfurt, the state capital. He had just passed another car on a highway when his car hit a concrete post and rolled over several times, police said. His spokesman said this week that Haider was drunk at the time of the crash. Besides being Carinthia's governor, Haider was also head of the right-wing BZO party (Alliance for the Future of Austria), which he founded in 2005 after years with the conservative Freedom Party. Haider came to prominence in 1986, when he became head of the Freedom Party while still in his 30s. A politician who projected youth and style, Haider appealed to many working-class Austrians, promising to cut their taxes and give money to those with children. Some older Austrians responded to his demands for strict law and order. But he drew widespread criticism both at home and abroad for his anti-immigrant stance and remarks considered anti-Semitic, and in 1991 he publicly praised Nazi Germany's employment policy. Asked in 2000 about the statement, Haider told CNN the quote was taken from a long speech and that he never praised the Third Reich. He called the remarks a mistake and publicly denounced Nazism. But Haider continued to draw attention for his controversial remarks. They included an address to veterans of the Waffen S.S., Adolf Hitler's elite soldiers, in which he praised their character. The address created an uproar after it was broadcast on German television. Haider said he had simply been speaking to elderly citizens of Carinthia who included some former Waffen S.S. members. Despite the controversy, Haider said he was not racist: \"You will not find any anti-Semitic position in our party program, and you will not find any anti-Semitic speech or statement by me.\" The policies of the Freedom Party drew international attention during the elections in 1999. Party campaign posters urged voters to stop the flood of immigration and used the term \"over-foreignization,\" the same word used by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels in 1933 to criticize what he called Jewish influence in Germany. Haider told CNN he favored restricting immigration simply because of Austria's small size, but that he wanted to keep an open border for refugees. It was his family background, Haider said, that kept singling him out for criticism. Haider's parents were activists in the Nazi Party long before Austrian-born Hitler annexed Austria to Germany in 1938. Haider's father, Robert, volunteered for the S.A., the notorious brown shirts who terrorized Jews and others before the war. He then served in the German army. His biographer, Melanie Sully, said Haider felt a strong sense of loyalty to his parents and those in the war generation. \"He feels that what they sacrificed after the war in rebuilding Austria in very difficult circumstances needs to be honored and that they weren't all criminals,\" Sully told CNN in 2000. Under Haider's leadership, the Freedom Party made a strong showing in the 1999 elections, winning 27 percent of the vote and shaking up the traditional two-party system that had ruled Austria since World War II. When the two main parties in that election failed to agree on forming a government together, the Freedom Party was invited to share power. Haider retired as party leader after that but remained governor of Carinthia. When Haider formed the BZO party three years ago, he took with him a number of Freedom Party lawmakers. Haider was credited with helping the BZO make significant gains in last month's general elections alongside the Freedom Party, though Austria's two largest parties, the Social Democrats and the People's Party, came out on top. The vote reflected reflected public dissatisfaction with the two largest parties as well as support for the social populism, anti-European Union and anti-immigrant rhetoric of the BZO and Freedom Party. southern Austrian city of Klagenfurt .", "e41b5047fa94c1e03fe7fdb2d6daa8b3a2244e64": "(CNN) -- The discovery of millions of extra ballots proves that President Robert Mugabe intends to rig next week's elections in his favor, Zimbabwe's main opposition party said Sunday. President Robert Mugabe gestures during a pre-election rally in Harare on Saturday. Tendai Biti, secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change, said that leaked correspondence from the election commission showed it had asked the company that is printing paper ballots to make 9 million. However, the African country has an electorate of 5.7 million registered voters, he said. Also, 600,000 postal paper ballots were requested for soldiers and police officers, Biti said. Postal ballots are usually requested for civil servants serving abroad, and the total number of soldiers and police in Zimbabwe add up to no more than 50,000, he said. \"Remember, when they stole this election away from us the last time, they stole it with 350,000 votes,\" Biti said. \"Six hundred thousand is double insurance. They cannot win a free and fair election in this country.\" The elections are slated for Saturday. Mugabe survived a hotly contested presidential challenge from MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai in 2002 amid widespread accusations of vote rigging. The president's other challenger this time is former Finance Minister Simba Makoni, who recently announced his bid to unseat Mugabe and was promptly booted out of the ruling party. Last week, New York-based Human Rights Watch raised doubts about the elections, saying it was likely to be \"deeply flawed.\" \"As the elections near, all indications are that once again the people of Zimbabwe will not be able to freely exercise their civil and political rights and vote for the candidates of their choice,\" the nongovernmental organization said in a 48-page report. The elections are expected to provide Mugabe with the toughest challenge yet in his nearly 28 years of rule. The report said the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission was partisan toward the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and had neither the expertise nor the resources to run the elections properly.  Watch Mugabe threaten to expel companies under British rule. \u00bb . That report brought derision from a Zimbabwean official. \"What qualifies them to do what they're doing -- policing the world and Africa in particular?\" asked Wilbert Gwashavanhu, political consul at Zimbabwe's embassy in Washington. \"Why don't they go to America and oversee how America holds its own elections?\" he said. \"Come on, give me a break! You can't judge the elections before they are held.\" No matter the final outcome of the election, the international community may never find out whether the vote proved to be free and fair. Independent news organizations are banned from Zimbabwe, and there are no credible monitors in place. Since 1980, the 84-year-old Mugabe has been the country's only ruler. But his odds of winning this time may be handicapped by Zimbabwe's dire economic situation. The rate of inflation reported in January was 100,000 percent, and food and fuel are in short supply, the Human Rights Watch document said. With more than three in four Zimbabweans unemployed, few could afford such food and fuel anyway. The country's downward economic spiral began in 2000, when Mugabe sanctioned the violent seizure of commercial farms, turning some of the land over to insiders and cronies. For his part, Mugabe remains defiant, blaming his country's economic woes on the West. E-mail to a friend .

Experts say that when a perception exists that gas is limited -- warranted or not -- consumers flock to the pumps even if officials implore them to stay calm. It's a combination of fear, desire, distrust and protectionism, experts say. \"When you have a perceived scarcity of any product, research shows the attractiveness of that product goes up,\" said Dr. Rao Unnava, marketing professor at Ohio State University. Grocery and department stores are keenly aware of the phenomenon, Unnava said, which is why sale flyers often declare things like, \"limit three items per customer\" or \"price valid only through Friday.\" Research shows that such advertisements can actually double or triple sales of a product, Unnava said. \"People don't feel comfortable with scarcity,\" he said. With gasoline, scarcity is a false perception, Unnava said. There is ample gas in the United States, even after Ike delivered 110-mph winds to Galveston and Houston, an area that's home to a significant portion of the nation's oil refineries. Gov. Rick Perry announced Monday that Texas' oil and gas industry \"dodged a bullet\" and that \"some of those refineries are actually back in operation as we speak.\" This isn't to say human nature alone drove the spike in gas prices; the oil market's supply side certainly played its part. Refineries, pipeline and oil platforms are still being assessed after Ike, but the damage apparently isn't as severe as predicted, said Gregg Laskoski, spokesman for the southern region of the American Automobile Association. Despite the rosier-than-expected outlook, prices spiked all over the nation after Ike struck the Gulf Coast -- about 6 cents a gallon Saturday, another 6 cents Sunday and about 5 cents Monday. Particularly hard hit was the central and eastern United States. From Sunday to Monday alone, 23 states saw the average price of gas jump about a nickel or more a gallon, according to AAA. iReport.com: Send, see photos of gas prices . In Tennessee, the price jumped about 17 cents to $4.12 Monday. In Georgia, the price climbed about 14 cents to $4.16. Michigan saw an almost 13-cent increase, and Indiana's gas went up 12 cents a gallon.  See gas prices state by state \u00bb . Several factors drive these fluctuations, Laskoski said, including the method in which gasoline is delivered to a state. In Florida, he said, the price went up nominally (about 5 cents) from Sunday to Monday because the Sunshine State relies more heavily on gas shipped on boats out of Louisiana and Mississippi, he said. Though Georgia abuts Florida, it doesn't have as many ports and relies more on tanker trucks to deliver gas from the Galveston-Houston area, Laskoski said.  Hear how man ran out of fuel looking for gas in Atlanta, Georgia \u00bb . Another factor, Laskoski said, is that Ike prompted many oil companies to shut down operations ahead of the storm. It could take up to two weeks to get some refineries operational again because it's not as simple as flipping a switch, he said. The hiatus in oil production has ripple effects, and retailers often raise prices in anticipation of gas shortages. Gas station owners earn only a few pennies of profit on each gallon of gas, Laskoski said, explaining that proprietors essentially use gas to lure consumers into convenience stores to buy cigarettes, beer and potato chips -- items that draw better profits. When supply is low and retailers are uncertain when they'll receive their next gas shipment, some proprietors actually raise their gas prices so they can keep their gas supply longer and maintain profits from their snacks and sundries. But while diminished refinery capacity helps drive prices upward, there is also an element of \"consumer behavior that goes beyond the norm,\" Laskoski said. \"When you have consumer behavior that's irrational, it's hard for retailers to schedule it,\" he said. Dr. Lars Perner, assistant professor of clinical marketing at the University of Southern California, said natural disasters often spawn irrational behavior. The media can also compound fears, he said. \"As soon as somebody starts running for the gas pumps, that's where the TV cameras go, so it does become a vicious cycle,\" Perner said. Even though everyone would be better off if consumers continued their normal patterns, people don't always trust their neighbors to cooperate. This is especially true with an \"emotional commodity\" like gas, Perner said. \"Because you can't count on other people doing that, your best bet is to go ahead and fill up yourself,\" he said. \"If people get excited, rationality tends to be reduced somewhat.\" Perner and Ohio State's Unnava both note that consumers are often reluctant to trust government officials so an appeal to remain calm might be met with suspicion rather than acquiescence. Memories -- whether they're of the calamitous response after Hurricane Katrina or of the gas shortages of the 1970s -- also play roles in a consumer's reaction to an event, the professors said. According to Unnava, \"It's all perception -- what you conclude from what you see around you -- that quickly sets up these behaviors.\"", "7b6150fb6bca4c47a2c95236aae6d84b35c9f2a1": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- There are few things in the world shrouded with as much secrecy as the super-yacht industry. Maritime mysteries: the design and building processes for super-yachts are tightly guarded secrets. The boats are built and kept in exclusive locations, they're owned by the notoriously inaccessible super-wealthy, and for most of us the closest we'll get to them is in the pages of glossy magazines. In a bid to gain a stronger insight into the super-yacht world I've organised an interview with Dr William Collier, the owner of Liverpool's G.L. Watson & Co - the oldest yacht design company in the world. The company formed in 1873 and in its time has produced four America's Cup yachts and more presidential and royal yachts than any other yacht designer. It seems the logical business to profile. But, there's a catch. In this industry 'loose lips' really do 'sink ships'... or at least destroy business, anyway. Collier can't tell me anything about the projects the company is working on, the people he's working for, or how much these ocean-going beasts cost to produce. \"We enter into very strict confidentiality agreements with our clients. We find it frustrating at times because we would like to approach people about doing a project because we have done a similar project - but we can't mention it. \"These guys can get into the press whenever they want. Unfortunately in the United Kingdom due to the nature of the press they have nothing to gain from having their personal property displayed for all to see,\" Collier told CNN. And when most of G.L. Watson & Co's business comes from client referrals, the company is wise not to jeopardize confidentiality agreements. Collier confirmed the company would have less than 100 clients on its books and it tries to manage several projects on differing scales at the one time. He said a usual workload was to have one 200-feet plus project, one around 100-150 feet and a few smaller projects on the go simultaneously. The 'smaller' vessels Collier refers to are often in the range of 60-80 feet long. Just tiny. Though Collier declines to comment on the net worth of his clients, I infer from the discussion that most of them are multi-millionaires, if not billionaires. This is certainly not a place for someone with shallow pockets. He said the current 'credit crunch' hitting many consumers was unlikely to have too much impact on his business. \"They would be generally insulated from that. Budget is always an issue for people but that is more because people don't like change. A lot of what we do is to protect the client's interests - to make sure they don't pay too much,\" he said. Collier said the company had two major strands: design and owner representation. While the first aspect is self-explanatory, the second involves the full management of entire building or restoration projects from the owner's point of view. The full process of building or restoring a boat usually took between three to five years and became quite an intimate affair, he said. \"We have a very close relationship with the clients. Inevitably because we are designing someone's ideal home we are finding out a lot about them and what they like and don't like. You get to know them very well.\" However, it's not all fairytales. The privileged position his job places him in also has its downfalls. \"Anyone who says these things go smoothly is lying,\" he laughed. Collier said although he had not experienced any disappointed clients, he had heard of cases where multi-million dollar vessels had not been to the satisfaction of the buyer. After buying the company in 2001 at a time when he had been personally working towards restoring a G.L. Watson & Co original, Collier -- a passionate sailor himself, said the market was changing. The company worked on both sailing and motor-powered yachts, and he said it was going back to the future in some respects. \"The company originally came very much out of a racing sailing design. From the 1880s it became more involved in cruise yacht design. What we are doing now is getting back into that big yacht market.\" He said there was a trend towards creating replicas or restorations with as many of the original materials as possible. \"People for many years have been restoring sailing yachts and in many instances they tend not to use original materials. But, people are becoming more educated in this market. \"Now, if people are going to do something in this market they want to do something special, something worthwhile,\" he said. One of the projects which Collier does detail is the Nahlin, a 296-foot 1930s G.L. Watson & Co original, which is set for restoration. After being returned to British waters only in 1999, Collier said the vessel would have a complete overhaul based on the company's archives of the original design, and it would become the \"biggest restoration project ever\". Collier said the company also planned to expand the range of services it provides to clients. Although there's plenty to look forward to at G.L. Watson & Co and business is flourishing -- Collier drops in a strong reminder that the job of pleasing wealthy clients does not open the door to excessive levels of wealth for himself. \"We are not yacht owners - we don't own these. We are here to produce them for orders.\" In fact, for one of the most glamorous industries in the world, Collier said there was plenty of hard graft done behind-the-scenes, and for him, a lot of travel to and from his Liverpool base. \"We don't always need to be in the Mediterranean! The lifestyle isn't always attractive.\"", "15d0e33a61d1f5be8feeb5ee90d24e45a7e03dcb": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Police have launched an investigation after a young disabled sportsman traveled to Switzerland to commit suicide, UK media report. Daniel James, who played rugby for England under-16s, was paralyzed during match practice last year. Daniel James, 23, from Sinton Green in western England was paralyzed from the chest down in March 2007 when a rugby scrum collapsed on top of him during match practice, dislocating his spine, the UK's Press Association has reported. Worcestershire Coroner's Service, which is conducing an inquest into the circumstances of his death, states on its Web site that James died on September 12 after he \"traveled to Switzerland with a view to ending his own life. He was admitted to a clinic where he died.\" The inquest was adjourned on September 19 for reports. West Mercia police say that a man and a woman are helping the force with their enquiries. Assisting someone to commit suicide is illegal in the UK, as it is in most other European countries. What do you think of assisted suicide? James, who played rugby for England under-16s, was a university student at the time of his injury last year. He is believed to be the youngest person from the UK to have traveled to Switzerland to commit suicide. In a statement Friday, reported by PA, James' parents said that he had attempted to kill himself several times already.  Watch why James opted for suicide \u00bb . \"His death was an extremely sad loss for his family, friends and all those that care for him but no doubt a welcome relief from the 'prison' he felt his body had become and the day-to-day fear and loathing of his living existence, as a result of which he took his own life. \"This is the last way that the family wanted Dan's life to end but he was, as those who know him are aware, an intelligent, strong-willed and some say determined young man,\" PA reported James' parents as saying. \"The family suffered considerably over the last few months and do wish to be left in peace to allow them to grieve appropriately.\" James' parents added that their son, \"an intelligent young man of sound mind,\" had never come to terms with his condition and was \"not prepared to live what he felt was a second-class existence\". Adrian Harling, the family solicitor, would not comment on the investigation, PA reported. More than 100 people from the UK who have committed suicide in Switzerland have traveled to the Dignitas Clinic in Forch. It is not known if James attended the clinic.

Wounded people get help after blasts Monday night during an independence day event in Morelia, Mexico. Two people remained in grave condition, said Roman Armando Luna Escalante, secretary of health in Michoacan state. Eleven of the wounded were children, Luna Escalante said. None of them are gravely injured. The explosions occurred around 11 p.m. near the governor's residence in Morelia, the capital of Michoacan. The second blast happened shortly afterward a few blocks away. Officials would not say if they have any suspects or if any group has claimed responsibility. Some experts pointed to drug cartels or insurgents. \"It could be a warning to the federal government, which has put a lot of money and manpower to deal with drugs, which are very powerful there,\" said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank on Western Hemisphere affairs. \"It could be leftist guerrilla groups that occasionally throw a bomb. \"The problem is that this is part of a real wave of violence that is consuming Mexico.\" Last week the bodies of 24 people, bound and shot execution-style, were found in Atlapulco, a town just south of Mexico City. Those killings Friday came roughly two weeks after tens of thousands of Mexicans marched on the nation's capital, calling for greater government action against the wave of violent crime. Non-governmental groups estimate there have been more than 1,500 killings in Mexico this year linked to organized crime. In late August, Mexican President Felipe Calderon met with the country's 32 governors to develop a plan to battle the rise in violent crime. Calderon, who was born in Morelia, condemned the attacks and said federal officials will redouble efforts to help state authorities investigate. More than 1,500 soldiers and federal police were maintaining order Tuesday, which marks the 198th anniversary of what Mexicans regard as their independence day. Festivities typically start the night before because on September 16, 1810, shortly before dawn, a priest in a village in the state of Guanajuato rang a church bell and called on Mexicans to fight for independence from Spain. The celebration in Morelia on Monday night was one of hundreds nationwide to celebrate that call for independence, which Mexico formally achieved in 1821.", "701e41c3767d4375fe4afb291d9e054ea6a04c2f": "(CNN) -- An animal rescue group on Sunday picked up a U.S. soldier's adopted dog from Iraq, ending the soldier's weeks-long struggle to send the animal to her Minnesota home. Sgt. Gwen Beberg adopted Ratchet after soldiers rescued him from a burning pile of trash in May. Operation Baghdad Pups, which said the U.S. military prevented its first attempt to take Ratchet the dog on October 1, picked up the animal in Baghdad with military clearance and flew it to Kuwait on Sunday. The dog is expected to be flown to Washington on Monday, and if a veterinarian determines it is healthy, sent to Sgt. Gwen Beberg's home state on Wednesday, Baghdad Pups publicist Larry Garrison said. Beberg, who adopted the dog after soldiers rescued it from a burning trash pile in May, tried to have the group fly Ratchet to the United States on October 1 as her deployment neared an end. But the military, which prohibits soldiers from adopting pets abroad and bringing them to the United States, confiscated the animal after Beberg put it on a convoy bound for Baghdad Airport, according to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which runs OBP. Ratchet and Beberg, 28, drew the attention of thousands of people who signed two online petitions -- linked through the SPCA's Web site -- urging the military to let Ratchet go to the United States. The military cleared OBP to take Ratchet on Wednesday, but not in time for the group's flight from Baghdad that day, the SPCA said. On Sunday, private security contractors took Ratchet from a base to the airport, where OBP -- which works with soldiers to help them bring adopted animals home -- put Ratchet on the charter flight to Kuwait, Garrison said. Northwest Airlines will donate the flights from Kuwait to Minnesota, Garrison said. The SPCA said Ratchet helped Beberg deal with her Iraq deployment, which started in September 2007 and is scheduled to end in November. \"She was absolutely miserable in the war and was really struggling to keep going every day. Ratchet turned it around for her,\" SPCA spokeswoman Stephanie Scroggs said last week. Beberg's mother, Patricia Beberg, in a statement released by the SPCA, said Ratchet \"was the savior of her [daughter's] sanity\" in Iraq. SPCA representatives said the military euthanizes some animals that it confiscates, and that Gwen Beberg worried that Ratchet would be killed. Beberg was thrilled to hear last week that the military would let OBP take Ratchet, the SPCA said. \"Your persistence and amazing work has astonished me throughout this whole thing,\" Gwen Beberg said in an e-mail to the SPCA, according to the society. Scroggs said one of Beberg's friends helped spread the news about Ratchet through blogs. One of the petitions, which had more than 65,000 signatures as of Sunday night, was started by a blogger, Scroggs said. The SPCA says although active-duty soldiers aren't allowed to adopt animals in the Middle East, many soldiers befriend animals in the course of their service there. Garrison said the program relies on donations, saying it generally costs $3,000 to $4,000 to bring a servicemember's animal to the United States. \"This isn't a one-time story This is a program making a difference for our soldiers,\" Garrison said.", "90062f4712d752122f89d8a4179fd7ca226c571f": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Negative attacks are as American as apple pie. Since the early days of the republic, candidates attacked with a vigor that contemporary strategists would admire. In the 1800 presidential election, for example, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams criticized one another with a stunning ferocity on everything from foreign and domestic policy to private character and personal behavior. Later campaigns weren't much better. Critics of Andrew Jackson in 1836 accused him of murdering Indians. In 1884, Grover Cleveland was ridiculed for fathering an illegitimate child. William Jennings Bryan was characterized as a dangerous radical in 1896 who would ruin the economy. Despite these historical precedents, the 2008 campaign has reached all-time lows in the use of misleading and inaccurate political appeals. Even Karl Rove, the architect of negative ads in previous campaigns, has complained about the tenor of this year's campaign. John McCain broadcast an ad taking Barack Obama's words out of context and suggesting Democrats were trying to compare GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin to a pig. The McCain campaign ran another spot erroneously claiming Obama favored comprehensive sex education for kindergarteners. Democrats have not been above reproach either. After McCain secured the GOP nomination this spring, outside groups falsely claimed the Republican supported a 1,000-year war in Iraq and therefore was not worthy of the presidency. These misleading appeals suggest voters must remain vigilant about candidate, party, and group claims. Generally, the most misleading commercials have come from independent groups uncoordinated with the candidates. These organizations feel free to run emotional and inaccurate content designed to play on voter's fears and anxieties. Some of the worst ads in recent memory, such as the Willie Horton ad in 1988, have been broadcast by these kinds of groups. In past years, the only upside of attack ads was that they generally contained more issue content than other types of ads. Since reporters police campaign appeals, the ads generally stick to the issues and rely on factually-accurate information. Ad sponsors and candidates realize they will be held accountable for unfair ad content. However, commercials run this year represent a break with this general pattern. Attack ads broadcast in recent months have twisted the truth, lied about personal background, taken statements out of context, and clearly sought to manipulate voter sentiments. Most worrisome from a factual standpoint is McCain's claim that Obama will raise taxes on the middle class. Although Obama has pledged to increase income taxes on those earning more than $250,000, he has been careful not to make proposals that would raise taxes on the middle class for fear of being labeled a tax-and-spend liberal. McCain's tax claims have been condemned by leading editorial boards and surely will attract considerable attention in upcoming debates. With all the factual inaccuracies that have taken place, voters need to protect themselves from efforts at political manipulation. Non-partisan Web sites such as www.factcheck.org represent one source of unbiased information. They analyze ads and compile factual information in support of or in opposition to ad claims. Other trustworthy fact-checkers include ad watches and reality checks run by leading news organizations. These features dissect candidate claims in regard to accuracy, strategy, and impact. But the best thing for voters to do is to watch the candidate debates and judge for themselves. Study the statements and the factual bases of policy claims. Pay attention to how the candidates speak and what they say. Find out what non-partisan groups think and see what they have to say regarding the major issues. By the time the campaign is over, the presidential candidates are expected to have spent 55 percent of their overall budget on ads. Strategists put together spots very carefully and pre-test major messages on small groups of voters. Most of this money will be devoted to television spots. But increasingly amounts are being targeted on radio, direct mail, and Internet appeals. In the end, voters are going to have to decipher competing charges and counter-charges amid considerable noise from all sides. The 2008 election is unusual in having so many big issues on the agenda: the economy, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, health care, taxes, immigration, education and climate change. It is an election that truly matters because of the stark differences between the parties and the closeness of the campaign. Voters need to pay serious attention to the facts in order to make a wise choice.

In fact, most won't be voting for quite a few years. But that doesn't mean that they have no interest in the race for the White House between Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain. As evidenced in videos posted at iReport.com, they care a great deal. Several of these videos were put together by school classes, like Matt MacFarlane's 7th and 8th graders at Templeton Middle School in Templeton, California, who made a short video on the importance of voting. The students called for a \"person with integrity who knows right from wrong\", \"a person of vision who not only knows what is but also what can be,\" \"a person with a moral compass to help [set] a course for our nation,\" and \"a person who has the ability to unite and inspire us as we face challenging times.\" MacFarlane's students urged voters to consider their decisions carefully on November 4. \"What's at stake in this election?\" asked one student. \"Everything.

All of the presidential and vice presidential \"candidates\" gave speeches, with Secret Service, prospective first ladies and family members in tow. Most members of Gov. Sarah Palin's family were present, including a baby doll portraying Trig. This video was just a part of their learning experience about presidential elections. Library media specialist Jill Weir, who submitted the video to iReport.com, said that the students also participated in mock-campaigning, voter registrations, precincts and exit polling. iReport.com: The 'candidates' speak .

Why don't I go around the neighborhood and ask the kids?\" The responses he got were both funny and thought-provoking. Some children saw the war as a major issue, one wanted more funding for education, and another said he was in favor of drilling for oil in Alaska. Some children seemed to be in favor of Obama, some for McCain, at least one liked both, and two of them started yelling at each other over which candidate was better. When asked about the candidates' families, one boy could easily name Obama's wife and daughters' names. When asked about McCain, he was a little fuzzier. \"He's been around for a long time. Like he's been around, [since] like 1966.\"  iReport.com: Kids sound off on the election . Tony Stampalia of Utica, New York, had a similar idea, asking students in an elementary school class whom they would vote for, based purely on the pictures of the candidates. Stampalia said that it was a tie between McCain and Obama, with one child for Ralph Nader. Obama \"voters\" in the class voted for their candidate because \"he has a cool suit,\" \"because he has the hair,\" \"because he has a nice smile.\" One Obama voter mistook him for President Bush, while another wore an Obama button but said she was supporting Sen. Hillary Clinton. McCain \"voters\" in the class liked his blue shirt and tie, and thought he was \"cute.\" One liked his \"white hair.\" Another one found that McCain \"made people do good stuff,\" but admitted that Obama did the same. All the children seemed to agree that \"your vote counts.\" iReport.com: Children pick their favorite candidate .

Do you change your style from coast to coast? In L.A. it's too easy to throw on a pair of American Apparel sweats, a T-shirt and running shoes and just wear those for days. In New York, I actually like looking nice. Maybe I'm just getting older, but young guys need to pull their pants up. Do you ever shop for your wife? I love shopping for dresses, and I actually do a pretty good job. When I was in New York, I went into J. Crew in Soho and got her a cool fifties type dress with tiny polka dots. Style-wise I'm good, but figuring out sizing is a different story. What do you find sexy on a woman? I like spaghetti straps for my wife -- she has great shoulders and a great neck. I love when she puts her hair up, because I can see the back of her neck, so delicate and vulnerable. It's the vampire in me. Or my obsession with cheerleaders -- their hair up in a ponytail. When I was young, I could never have that. Never got the cheerleader? Eventually -- my wife was a cheerleader. What does your wife find sexy on you? A button-front shirt with [baby] spit-up on the shoulder. That means a guy is taking care of the kids and is a good father -- that's sexy to a woman. The adult version of rose petals and champagne is if I let my wife sleep in and I get up to change the baby's diaper, feed the kids, and do the dishes. Who inspires you? Paul Newman. My middle name is Paul, and my grandfather once said I was going to look like Paul Newman. That stuck with me. Beyond being a good-looking guy, Newman is a great actor with a long career, and he's got a life. He's married with kids and lives in Connecticut, sells popcorn and marinara sauce, and gives the money to charity. Anyone else? George Clooney dresses like Gary Cooper might have. Cary Grant. \"A Streetcar Named Desire\"-era Marlon Brando. They all made it look effortless. Their clothes framed their personalities really well -- comfortable, classic, but sharp. These guys could pull off a great suit, or jeans and a T-shirt. Don't you agree that guys have it easy -- they are considered \"distinguished\" as they grow older? I don't think it's guy-specific. As women get older, they become more comfortable with themselves. Susan Sarandon is the poster woman for that. A lot of guys fantasize about being with women who are in their forties or fifties. So your advice is ...? Act your age. Dress your age. Look your age. That doesn't mean you can't have fun. And isn't it time you got the girl in one of your movies?

Park benches are strewn about in downtown Houston Saturday during Hurricane Ike. As of Saturday afternoon, the Galveston Fire Department had taken 27 people to a shelter in a high school on the coastal island, which was without electricity or water pressure. No casualties had been discovered so far in the search and rescue efforts, which have been hampered by heavy flooding and scattered debris. Galveston had ordered evacuation of the island, but Galveston City Manager Steve LeBlanc said about 40 percent of the city's 57,523 residents chose to stay. LeBlanc said the island would be closed while authorities assess damages, including to the causeway, which was in \"bad shape\" because of debris and road damage. \"The road buckled in a number of places,\" LeBlanc said. \"Even if we opened it up you couldn't get through.\" LeBlanc said 17 buildings on the island had been destroyed by fires, potent winds and a strong storm surge. \"We are in a recovery mode,\" Galveston Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas said in a press conference Saturday afternoon. \"This eye came right over us, stayed a while and went on, but it brought a lot of damage to our city.\" Ike was downgraded Saturday to a tropical storm 11 hours after it crashed ashore as a Texas-sized hurricane that walloped southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana. In its wake, Ike -- which smashed into the coast as a Category 2 hurricane -- left four people dead, millions without power and destroyed homes and businesses along the Gulf Coast with powerful winds, rain and floodwaters. President Bush declared 29 Texas counties and parts of Louisianans major disaster areas, making federal funds available for recovery from the storm.  View images of places hit by Ike \u00bb . Many people, like D.J. Knight of Pearlman, Texas, decided to ride out the storm at home, despite voluntary and mandatory orders issued across the region. \"The windows looked like they would explode,\" said Knight, a mother of two. \"It just wouldn't stop.\" Now, without electricity and surrounded by flooded roads and wreckage, Knight wonders whether it was worth enduring a sleepless night as the storm shook her home, located about halfway between Galveston and Houston. \"I didn't think it would be as bad as it was,\" she said. \"It was horrible.\" Knight is one of thousands waiting for assistance as the state rolls out the largest search and rescue operation in Texas history.  See pictures of the storm's destruction \u00bb . Gov. Rick Perry dispatched a 1,000-strong search and rescue team, including state troopers, pilots and members of the National Guard. Lines of National Guard trucks and ambulances were deployed from San Antonio even as officials are trying to grasp the extent of damage and the number of Texans stranded by the storm. However, flooding and debris have impeded rescue efforts in some areas, adding to the uncertainty about how many Texans actually survived the storm. \"We're obviously concerned that there may be people we find who didn't get out and who are going to be in the rubble of what we uncover,\" said Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff. \"We hope for the best, but I do want to prepare people for the fact they we may have some fatalities.\" Chertoff said 40,000 Texans were in 250 shelters, and that food and water would be distributed in about 20 coastal locations as rescue efforts continue. In Galveston, which bore the brunt of the storm, floods filled the historic district with 7 feet of water at the storm's peak, said Galveston County official Margaret Bunch.  Watch how a spunky little girl braved the storm \u00bb . A foot of water flooded the city's main courthouse, where many people rode out the storm, she said. Wanda Collins' garage filled with 5 feet of water, ruining everything inside, including a 2002 pickup truck, two Harley-Davidson motorcycles, a freezer and a washer and dryer. \"I have never in my life seen water like this,\" the 30-year Galveston resident said. Burle and Jamie Holmes also refused to leave their Galveston home despite a grim warning from the National Weather Service. Ike forced the couple and their dog, Trouble, into the attic, tossing their furniture like toys across the house. \"We lost everything,\" Jamie Holmes. Curfews are in place in Galveston until dawn Monday and in Houston's Harris County until 6 a.m. Sunday. Houston Mayor Bill White said his city appears to have avoided loss of life, but streets blocked by floodwaters, downed trees and power lines hampered efforts to determine the full extent of the damage. Authorities shut down downtown Houston, where the streets were littered with traffic lights and glass, for cleanup and damage assessment. The city's tallest skyscraper, the 75-story JP Morgan Chase Tower, was missing many of its windows.  See iReporter's images of destruction \u00bb . White advised residents to drink bottled or boiled tap water as a precaution after a power outage reduced water pressure, but he said nothing indicated that the water supply was contaminated. Brennan's, a popular restaurant in downtown Houston for almost four decades, burned down Friday night as Ike battered the city. North of Houston, a 10 -year-old boy died when a falling tree limb hit him in the head, the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office said. The boy's father was cutting down a dead tree in the family's yard in preparation for Ike's heavy winds early Saturday. Nearly 2.6 million customers in Texas and Louisiana lack power because of Ike, the U.S. Energy Department said on Saturday. In Brazoria County, emergency management officials said the main power line for the Texas/New Mexico grid was down. CenterPoint Energy said 90 percent of its customers were without electricity and it could take a month or more to get power restored to all of them. iReporter Jackie Hensler of Houston said her apartment building's power was restored quickly on Saturday morning after a stormy night. \"There are lots of trees down; they've been uprooted or snapped,\" she said after venturing outside. \"There's lots of debris in the streets, like boards and plywood from homes.\"  Watch how the roof peeled off a building \u00bb . Hurricane Ike proved to be a huge storm system, 900 miles across at its largest. It remained a hurricane hours after crashing ashore over Galveston at 2:10 a.m. Its maximum sustained winds were near 80 mph, with higher gusts. It was expected to continue to weaken and move into western Arkansas by Saturday night.  Track the storm \u00bb . The storm surge, however, was smaller than forecast. The greatest surge, of 15 feet, happened at Sabine Pass, near the Texas-Louisiana line. Authorities had predicted surges of 20 to 25 feet. Authorities in Orange County, Texas, on the Louisiana line, were using large dump trucks Saturday to rescue residents trapped on their roofs by massive flooding, a county judge told CNN. The city of Orange and the town of Bridge City were flooded, Beaumont emergency official Brad Peneffon said.  Watch the storm surge in Beaumont \u00bb . Rescuers fanned out in boats Saturday in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, after the storm surge flooded 1,800 homes. Gas prices soared across the country amid fears the storm would disrupt fuel supplies. Ike hit a region that is home to about 25 percent of the United States' oil refining capacity, and the storm's progress across the Gulf of Mexico shut down crude oil collection from Gulf oil fields. The U.S. Department of Energy said 14 refineries were closed by the storm, along with two Texas strategic petroleum reserve sites. In Knoxville, Tennessee, Sean Kennedy expressed dismay at the difference a day made to gas prices. iReport.com: Evacuees, San Antonio mayor talk about Ike . \"I filled up my tank yesterday morning on the way to work for $3.59 a gallon,\" he said. \"This morning, gas prices at the same station were $5 a gallon for regular and $5.25 for premium.\" The Coast Guard said early Saturday that 22 people aboard a freighter that was adrift in the Gulf of Mexico were safe after the storm. Some good news came out of the region Saturday. About 175 miles west of Houston, a storm evacuee delivered a baby in the ladies' bathroom at a shelter in New Braunfels. \"The credit goes to the mother,\" said Dr. Mark Burns, who helped deliver the baby. \"She did a beautiful job with her delivery.\" CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Rusty Dornin, Sean Callebs, Rob Marciano, Gary Tuchman, Arthur Brice, Deb Krajnak and Elise Miller contributed to this report.", "5c400c2b78a6b358c8f4ae01bd698b267cd6d1d5": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- John Darwin's wife said her husband faked his own death to avoid mounting debts and holed up in the family home for years, hiding from his own sons, according to UK media reports. Anne Darwin said her husband, believed by police and his sons to have been lost at sea five years ago, recently returned to the UK, faking amnesia, because he missed his now-adult children, according to The Daily Mirror. \"I didn't think he would get away with it but he had had enough of being dead,\" she is quoted as saying. John Darwin, 57, is being questioned by police in northeastern England following his arrest on suspicion of fraud, a spokesman for Cleveland, England, police said. Darwin walked into a police station in London last weekend -- five years after he was thought to have died after the remains of a canoe he paddled into the North Sea, off northeastern England, washed up on shore. Darwin was declared dead by a coroner in 2003, 13 months after his disappearance in March 2002. His wife, the paper reported, described how the prison officer and former teacher discussed faking his death just before he disappeared because of mounting debts. When John Darwin vanished she said she thought he was dead -- until, she is reported to have said, he turned up on the doorstep of the family home at Seaton Carew, northeastern England, one year later. \"I didn't even recognize him at first,\" Anne Darwin told the newspaper, adding that her husband looked thin, dirty and smelled dreadful. \"I was relieved he was alive, of course. But I was also very angry with him.\" She said that her husband stayed at the home on and off before he got a one-room apartment in another part of the large house so he could vanish if friends or family arrived, also disguising himself with a hat or limp when he went outside. But hiding away began to take its toll, Anne Darwin reportedly said, and the pair decided to leave Britain. Her husband traveled on a false passport to look at property in Cyprus and inquire about buying a catamaran in Gibraltar, she said, before they finally settled in Panama. She went to live there six weeks ago. She is believed to be in the United States after leaving Panama on a flight late Thursday, a Panamanian immigration representative has told CNN. Anne Darwin, the newspaper said, stated that it was always her plan to repay two insurance policies in her husband's name: one, a life insurance policy, for \u00a325,000 ($50,000); and another for \u00a3130,000 ($265,000), which was paid to their home loan company to pay off the mortgage in the event of her husband's death. The newspaper said she was not paid for her story and accepts she is likely to be arrested upon her return to Britain. Following his reappearance last weekend, John Darwin was initially reunited with his two sons, who released a joint statement saying their father claimed to have amnesia dating back to June 2000. But in a statement released by Cleveland police Thursday, the sons, Mark, 31, and Anthony, 29, said they were in an \"angry and confused state of mind\" and they wanted no further contact with their parents. After media reports Thursday that Anne Darwin had confessed to knowing her husband was alive, the sons said: \"If the papers' allegations of a confession from our mam are true, then we very much feel that we have been the victims in a large scam.\" \"In the short space of time following our dad's appearance in London on Saturday, we have gone through a rollercoaster of emotion,\" the statement said. \"From the height of elation at finding him to be alive to the depths of despair at the recent stories of fraud and these latest pictures,\" it added. \"How could our mam continue to let us believe our dad had died when he was very much alive? We have not spoken to either of our parents since our dad's arrest and at this present time we want no further contact with them,\" the statement said.

Eric Hahn, 21, estimates he will be in debt for the next five to seven years for his undergraduate tuition. Just a few weeks later, Hahn, 21, was forced to cash in his savings and investments so he could make his rent and tuition after finding out that the lender, MyRichUncle.com, had suspended its private student loan program. \"Due to continued disruptions in the capital markets, combined with the continued demand we have experienced this year, we are reaching funding capacity limits,\" a message on his cell phone said, mimicking a statement on the company's Web site. The sudden news left Hahn, a senior-year finance major, scrambling to find additional funding after maxing out his borrowing options from the federal government. Eventually, the country's leading student loan provider, Sallie Mae, approved him for a private loan at 12 percent. After he graduates, Hahn estimates it will take him anywhere from five to seven years to repay about $30,000 he will have borrowed by then. \"Money isn't cheap,\" said Hahn, who transferred to Georgia State University in Atlanta from the University of Connecticut last year because the tuition was less expensive. \"The process is time-consuming, and there's also the stress of having to liquidate my investments and wonder where I'm going to find money.\" About 8 percent of student borrowers rely on private loans, which tend to be costlier and stricter than federal loans, said Robert Shierman, executive director of the Institute for College Access and Success. In doing so, Hahn and others like him are getting a crash course in market volatility and its effects on the consumer's ability to find money.  Watch how the current economic troubles affect consumers \u00bb . MyRichUncle.com is the most recent lender to suspend its private student loan program, joining the ranks of major financial institutions like Wachovia and Bank of America and companies specializing in student loans such as College Loan Corporation and Campus Door, which was backed by Lehman Brothers. MyRichUncle's president and co-founder, Raza Khan, told CNN: \"We are currently working with a number of investors so we can resume loan origination as soon as possible. \"Meanwhile, students and parents should not lose sight of the value of education. Funds do remain available -- we encourage families to do all the homework and research, and to make prudent decisions on borrowing,\" he added in a written statement. Since August 2007, 33 lenders have suspended private loans programs, according to the Web site FinAid.org, which tracks activity in the student loan market.  Unlike federal lending programs, private loans rely on liquidity from investors. Even though private loans are considered strong by industry standards, they are feeling the effects of a turbulent capital market. \"The only reason lenders had to stop making the loans was that they ran out of liquidity,\" said financial aid expert Mark Kantrowitz, who created FinAid.org. \"It's a contagion effect of the sub-prime crisis,\" said Kantrowitz. \"It's an overreaction that has affected the student loan market.\" With their strong resemblance to consumer loans, where lenders set the terms based on your credit score, financial advisers often recommended private loans as a means of last resort. But with rising tuition and increased enrollment putting a squeeze on the student aid market -- which disbursed about $60 billion in federal funds and $17 billion in private loans last year -- students are turning to private loans after they've exhausted all other avenues, or for expenses that federal aid won't cover. In response, Congress passed legislation this year to increase the maximum amount of federal loans that students can obtain. \"With federal student loan limits increasing, you can borrow now more than last year, regardless of income, assets, collateral or income,\" said Martha Holler, vice president of corporate communications of Sallie Mae. Despite the uncertainty in the capital market, many lenders, including Sallie Mae, are still able to offer private student loans by securing lines of credit and raising liquidity on their own. Holler says other options also exist, from scholarships for skills as random as skateboarding, to tuition payment plans -- an interest-free option that allows borrowers to make payments in monthly installments. But students like Hahn remain on the fringe. Even after being awarded an out-of-state tuition waiver, which lets him pay the same tuition as a resident from Georgia, he says he has borrowed all he can in federal loans. His parents, who are facing their own financial struggles, can't co-sign for a loan with a lower interest rate or better terms. Nevertheless, Hahn has accepted his fate. As school begins, he is returning his focus to his studies. \"It's a pain in the neck, but it is what it is,\" he said in a telephone interview in between classes Wednesday. \"The reason this all happened is due to the credit crisis and the housing crisis. So I guess the lesson is don't hop on what everyone else is doing.\" CNN's Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report .", "24959a531f3f3b5db65f821e87eb1a62e2b0e5ae": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States Agency for International Development, USAID, on Monday urged the Cuban government to think again about its refusal of direct U.S. assistance for hurricane victims. \"We call on the Cuban government to reconsider their decision on the United States offer, which we made with no preconditions and whose only objective was to get relief to people in dire need.\" USAID administrator Henrietta Fore said in a Monday afternoon conference call with reporters. Fore said the United States over the weekend had offered to begin relief flights as soon as Tuesday to Cuba, on civilian aircraft, delivering plastic sheeting, blankets and hygiene kits. The first flight would have brought aid worth $349,000. \"And while we wait for the Cuban government's reconsideration of the United States offer we will continue to implement other components of our $5 million assistance package,\" Fore added. The United State will immediately obligate approximately $1.5 million in emergency humanitarian assistance to reputable international relief organizations and nongovernmental organizations. Fore said she will be in Honduras on Tuesday to inspect hurricane damage and review aid needs there. Earlier in the day, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack gave the first information that United States had made a weekend offer -- and the Cuban government had refused -- of $5 million in hurricane relief. The United States on Saturday \"informed the Cuban government that the U.S. government is committed to providing up to $5 million in relief assistance to Cuban hurricane victims and that we could fly emergency relief supplies to Cuba as soon as the Cuban government authorized such assistance,\" McCormack said at his daily briefing. \"On the 14th of September, just yesterday, the Cuban government informed us they would not accept a donation from the United States,\" he said. The United States has temporarily suspended some restrictions on private aid groups, sending assistance and money to Cuba.

Reese Witherspoon says she wants to banish the myth that young women are not at risk for breast cancer. (CNN) -- Every three minutes in the United States, a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. As a woman, a mother, and a daughter, I find that statistic terrifying. I was never na\u00efve about breast cancer, but hearing this statistic put it all into perspective.   Women close to me have battled the disease and are now soldiers in the greater fight against it. But the moment I heard \"every three minutes,\" I felt vulnerable and scared as I realized that anyone is susceptible. The only way for me to ease my fears was to take action. I needed to educate myself and others on this disease. As the Honorary Chair for the Avon Foundation, I had resources at my fingertips. I had access to an entire organization that is dedicated to giving back to women and educating people. So I started asking, \"What do I need to know?\" It was through that curiosity that I found out the most important fact in breast cancer: Early detection saves lives. According to the Avon Foundation Breast Cancer Crusade, there is a 97 percent five-year survival rate when breast cancer is caught before it spreads to other parts of the body. When breast cancer first develops, there are usually no symptoms, which is why women need to perform self-exams regularly and contact their doctor upon noticing even the smallest change. Of course talking about breast cancer and breast health is a personal thing. I too am a private person but encourage all women to break through their reservations and talk to their doctors and physicians. We must also banish the myth that young women are not at risk for breast cancer. At the Avon Walk in Washington, I met young survivors who were diagnosed in their 20s, an age when most women are graduating from college and just starting their lives as full adults.  Watch Reese and Larry at the Avon Walk \u00bb . Women in their 20s and 30s should have a clinical breast exam by a health professional at least once every three years and women 40 and older should have an exam every year. I am passionate about fighting this devastating disease. I fight for my mother, myself, my children and future generations of women, so one day we will not have to be afraid of breast cancer. I began my fight by learning important first steps in breast cancer detection, and will not end my fight until every woman can stand together saying we are breast cancer free. More than anything else, I have faith -- faith we will find a cure. I saw this commitment in the faces of the women in Washington -- in the faces of the women walking and the women and men who stood on the sidelines encouraging the 3,500 participants to the finish line. I was cheering right along with them, screaming for action to find a cure.  Avon's next walk will take place in New York City on October 4 and 5.", "9292fe37c75335945e3f305d8c32363dc358cae0": "Editor's note: Join Roland S.

He is the author of \"Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith\" and \"Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America.\" Please visit his Web site. Roland S. Martin urges the candidates to stop with the lofty talk and simplistic solutions and be specific. (CNN) -- If you are a member of America's middle class in this presidential year, you are sort of like a blue-chip football recruit, lavished with praise, attention and adoration from fawning coaches and alumni who would love nothing better than to land the prized player to win the national championship. For \"Coach\" John McCain and \"Coach\" Barack Obama, the title to win is president of the United States, and like the big-time football coaches, they will say and do anything to make it happen. Tax cuts? Oh, absolutely, we don't want you to feel any more pain. Let the rich -- and the poor -- deal with carrying the burden. You want more jobs? Sure, we're going  to force companies that send jobs overseas to make them stay at home because we know you need those long disappearing and high-paying manufacturing jobs that helped build this nation. Can't afford to send your kids to college? Don't sweat it. We've got tax credits, Pell grants, super-duper loans and all kinds of other options to make this a reality. Are they cutting back on health care at your job? No big deal. Coach McCain says he's got some nifty tax credits lined up to tickle your fancy and ignite your soul. Coach Obama? He's going to go for the whole enchilada by pushing for virtual universal health care. Oh, these guys are wonderful with their sales pitches. They have the ability to make every single one of you feel so special and loved; no one else is more important to them -- at that moment. I must admit, the pathetic pining and pandering for middle-class votes has turned so moronic that at times it drives me nuts. First, who in the world are we even talking about? If you listen to the candidates and their campaigns, those in the middle class could make upward of $200,000 a year, while some suggest middle class means earning as little as $20,000. I moderated a panel Tuesday for the National Black MBA Association and heard descriptions of the lower middle class, the middle class and the upper middle class. Someone even suggested that it's really about a \"state of mind.\" That's right. It boils down to how we feel and think. If that's the case, then you can have $5 million in the bank, but if you love your family, go to church and share the same values as others around you, you're middle class. Please, can we just stop with lofty talk and plain-spoken and simplistic solutions and be as specific as possible? There are really four fundamental issues affecting middle-class voters. Jobs . We've seen a loss of 600,000 jobs under President Bush, so how exactly will McCain and Obama create jobs? Is there anything in their past that shows they have the ability to do just that? I've heard \"drill, drill, drill!\" from McCain, and Obama says we're going to turn the old textile and steel mills into a green machine by targeting wind and other sources of energy. Housing . Congress is providing a backstop for Wall Street -- making billions available if cash is needed. What will McCain and Obama actually do to keep folks from losing their homes? Oh, I know a lot of people suggest that these middle-class folks should have read the fine print and not gotten in over their heads, but if something is good for Wall Street, why not Main Street? Health care . This is no joke, and a primary reason why Americans file for bankruptcy. I know. My appendix ruptured in 2000 while covering the Democratic National Convention, forcing me to spend five days in a Los Angeles hospital and accruing more than $70,000 in hospital bills. Yep, I didn't have health insurance. I was just a 29-year-old never-been-sick freelancer stuck out in the cold. The pressure of that led to falling behind on my mortgage, and the start of foreclosure proceedings. Bankruptcy was the only thing that saved me, and by the grace of God, my finances turned around, and this month, I'm making my final payment. McCain says a $5,000 tax credit for health care will help, but the problem with that is you have to pay the dough upfront, and then claim it on your taxes. But what happens when they want the money now? Obama says the answer is his health care plan, but that switch won't be flipped immediately. So what happens while the laborious debate takes place? I just wait for my MRI until Washington finishes debating and the special interests pick the plan to death? Education . For many Americans, education is a ticket to the middle class and beyond. Much of the time the candidates talk about vouchers. Look, that's not going to solve the education problem. What we should be hearing them talk about is the inequity of the school systems. Children living in wealthy school districts get tons of money and the best qualified  teachers, while poorer districts are forced to make do with less qualified teachers and without computers or even basic amenities. The bottom line . Remember those blue-chip players? Today, they are telling a coach: If you want me to sign, promise that I'll start. No play, no sign. That's what middle-class Americans must tell the candidates. If you are unwilling to put your personal credibility and integrity behind your campaign pledges, then you don't get my vote. And if you give away your vote just because someone is a Democrat or Republican, or a man or a woman, or black or white, and you end up getting screwed in the end, you have no one to blame but yourself. So use the most powerful thing you have to demand real answers to your real problems from McCain, Obama, Joe Biden and Sarah Palin: your vote. The power is literally in your hands.

Jessica Schuette's tattoo reminds her of her late friend, who was a big fan of Pink Floyd. Wright, a founding member of epic rock group Pink Floyd, died Monday. The keyboardist had been battling cancer and succumbed at his home in Britain. Wright is credited with writing some of the band's most well-known hits, such as \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" and \"Us and Them.\" Pink Floyd has thousands of devoted fans across the world, and the news of Wright's death inspired many of them to write into iReport to share how Richard Wright and the rest of the group touched and changed their lives. Jessica Schuette shared a photo of her Pink Floyd-inspired tattoo: a shimmering diamond above the words \"shine on.\" She got the tattoo in 2005 in memory of her best friend, who died in a car accident. \"This was her favorite song. I got this tattoo to remember her,\" Schuette said. \"If that doesn't say something about the impact that this band has had on people, I don't know what will.\" Pink Floyd touched the lives of Schuette and her friend even though they were never able to see one of the band's legendary live shows. Schuette, who is a dedicated Pink Floyd fan herself, pointed out that she's only 21 -- born 13 years after they released the epic album \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" and too young to have seen the band live when they were touring. iReport.com: Read more of Schuette's thoughts . Omar Pelea of Miami, Florida, hopes the tragedy of Wright's death will give Schuette and other fans their long-awaited chance to see the group live.

Comedian Chris Rock told Larry King he's proud of Barack Obama's character. Rock, an avid supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama, spoke with CNN's Larry King on Thursday. He said Obama is more grounded with your average American -- not somebody like McCain with \"12 houses.\" \"The other guy [McCain] can lose five houses,\" Rock said. \"I'll go with the guy with one house. The guy with one house is scared about losing his house.\"  Watch Chris Rock describe a beaten up McCain \u00bb . King began the interview by asking Rock about Thursday's economic bailout talks when Obama and McCain went to the White House for discussions with the nation's top leaders. KING: Obama and McCain at opposite ends of the table. What do you make of it? ROCK: What do I make of it? If this was a boxing match, McCain would be holding. KING: Holding on? ROCK: Yes. It's like he got hit really hard in the stomach like, 'OK. I can't let him go. He's going to knock me out.' So that's what appears to be going on right now. Just a hold. KING: Has the financial crisis affected you? ROCK: Larry, I drove a cab over here tonight. When it's over, I'm going to try to pick up some more fares. I'm losing everything, Larry. KING: Really downtrodden? ROCK: Yes, it's real bad. KING: Have HBO paid you already? ROCK: They have paid me, but the money is worthless now. Haven't you heard? Your money's worth nothing. KING: You must be ... proud that at this stage in our history a black man is running for president on a major ticket. ROCK: Um, you know what? I'm proud Barack Obama's running for president. You know? If it was Flavor Flav, would I be proud? No. I don't support Barack Obama because he's black. KING: I said just as a proud feeling. That's normal. ROCK: There's a proud feeling because of the character of the man. You know, I was -- I supported John Kerry and, you know -- and what's my man? Al Gore. KING: Al Gore. ROCK: But this guy seems to be a little bit more. He seems to have watched other peoples' mistakes and, you know, seems to have a little bit more going on. KING: From a comedic stand point, who is funnier, McCain or Obama? Seriously. Is Obama not -- it's hard to be funny about Obama? ROCK: No, no. It's weird. People ask me that all the time. ... McCain jokes are just easy jokes, like I don't want a president with a bucket list. That's like a McCain joke. Those jokes are easy. It's like you basically, you know, you know, take the dust off your Reagan jokes and tell them again. You know? But Obama, oh, this is a whole new set of jokes. I got to find a whole new move to the basket here. So I kind of hope he wins. KING: Didn't you introduce Obama at a rally? ROCK: I introduced Obama at the Apollo Theater not too long ago. I think Obama would be great. I mean, just look the big thing right now is the economy. And people are going broke. And here: The choice isn't Republican or Democrat. The choice is you got a guy that's worth $150 million with 12 houses against a guy who's worth a million dollars with one house. KING: Well -- . ROCK: The guy with one house really cares about losing a house, because he is homeless. The other guy can lose five houses and still got a bunch of houses. Does this make any sense? Am I the only one that sees this? KING: It's unique way of ... ROCK: I'm just saying, John McCain could lose half his houses. KING: You got a point. ROCK: And sleep well. KING: You and Bill Clinton were on Letterman on Tuesday. You had some problems with the tone of his endorsement of Barack Obama. ... Do you think Bill is hesitant about Barack Obama? ROCK: You know what? You know, he did a great speech in Denver. And Hillary's been on the campaign trail. Just at that moment, if you watched what happened on David Letterman, it appeared he was holding back. And when you tell a joke and everybody laughs, it is not because they disagree with what you're saying. So -- . KING: They get it? ROCK: Yes, they get it. The whole audience was in on it. But, you know, hey, the guy's in a weird position there. His wife ran for the thing and she didn't win. KING: The next night, on \"The Daily Show,\" Jon Stewart asked Clinton about the Letterman appearance and Clinton suggested that Obama supporters who questioned commitment are missing the point. ROCK: It was great. It was great. And you're right, [Obama] does need to get some of the votes that went to Hillary and all that. I don't understand any Democrat that voted for Hillary that doesn't support Obama. Because their views are pretty similar. You know what I mean? ... I understand people supporting Mr. McCain. But a Democrat that's going to just be mad is -- there's something kind of really messed up about that. KING: Have you always done political humor? ROCK: You know -- . KING: When you started, did you do politics? ROCK: I'm interested in the world. Jon Stewart does political humor. Bill Maher does political humor. I talk about stuff the way guys would talk about it at the barber shop. I don't belong on any panel on this show. You know what I mean? I don't deserve to be near Roland Martin and Anderson Cooper and all these guys. I try to talk about politics in a way a guy that works at UPS would understand. KING: You did a lot of Brooklyn stuff. ROCK: I do all sorts of stuff, Larry. All sorts of stuff. You know, I hope Obama wins just because, you know, the country needs it. The country needs a change. We kind of seen what this whole McCain thing is. And I'll go with the guy with one house. The guy with one house is scared about losing his house. KING: I never thought of it that way. ROCK: It is that simple.", "87c41a0c17143a88ea8234f102c100868fe86e58": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some experts are skeptical that anything could have stopped Robert Hawkins from going on a murderous rampage at an Omaha, Nebraska, shopping mall on Wednesday. A police car sits outside the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska, on Thursday. \"This is not something that anybody can reasonably anticipate,\" said Don Greene, a former FBI agent who has written a book on mall security. \"If the people closest to him didn't see any indicators or signs that he was going to go off so drastically ... how is some public safety officer supposed to recognize this person?\" Greene asked. In fact, security at Omaha's Westroads Mall did find Hawkins' behavior suspicious before the shooting, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said Thursday. Mall surveillance initially flagged Hawkins \"based on his actions\" when he entered the mall through the Von Maur store's main entrance on the second floor, Warren said. He said Hawkins exited quickly after entering, then re-entered within six minutes and appeared to be concealing something in a balled-up sweatshirt. He then went up the elevator to the third floor, and when he got there, he immediately began firing, Warren said.  \"It doesn't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention,\" he said. Shopping malls around the country were expected to review their emergency plans and consider additional security measures in light of Wednesday's shooting, which killed eight.  Watch what experts say about keeping malls safe \u00bb . \"There is always a fear of copycats when something like this happens,\" said Malachy Kavanaugh, spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers. He said malls would be considering whether to close some entrances, bring in additional officers, and make security more visible. There are 1,200 enclosed malls in the United States and about 50,000 shopping centers. Although some include police substations, most are patrolled by unarmed private mall and store security guards. Should these private security guards be armed? \"Absolutely not,\" said Greene. Greene said if a security officer were to pull a gun on an armed individual in a mall, it could result in \"the gunfight at the 'OK corral,' and then we might have 23 people killed instead of eight.\" \"These random events are very challenging to prevent and difficult to deal with when they occur. Law enforcement and security prevention measures, no matter how good, cannot forestall a tragedy such as this from happening,\" said a statement issued Wednesday night by the Simon Property Group, which operates regional and outlet malls across the United States. \"We do not disclose or discuss our enhanced security measures and/or procedures that we have in place or may institute at any given time, some of which are visible to the public, with others intentionally less noticeable,\" the statement said. \"Disclosure of such information could potentially compromise our efforts to provide a safe and secure environment.\" Security expert Lou Palumbo told CNN one useful strategy was having trained law enforcement personnel watching people as they enter the mall. \"You start to observe the people coming into the mall area,\" he said. \"To let them in your door and then try to figure out what they're doing, you know, it's not as effective as catching them as they're coming in the door.\" The International Council of Shopping Centers has conducted focus groups with shoppers to test how they would react to even tighter \"airport style\" security measures, including bag checks and magnetometers. According to Kavanaugh, the results have shown that shoppers would accept the measures only if the national threat advisory system was raised to its highest level, red. Such extreme measures are \"in the mall industry playbook ... but it is something no one wants to do,\" said Kavanaugh. While some mall owners have increased training of security personnel and have upgraded their emergency systems, many security experts believe more should and can be done. Those experts suggest it's a matter of money. They say until shoppers start staying away, mall owners will not make significant changes. There are no national standards for security guards, and according to a 2006 study by the Police Foundation, only a few states require background checks, minimum hiring standards, or training. The study also notes that drills to test security staffs' knowledge of what to do in an emergency, when done at all, \"are seldom rigorous, seldom done with first responders, and are usually done without clear standards to measure their success.\" The report goes on to say that \"many malls do not even have plans to limit access to sensitive areas in times of heightened alert.\" Since that report was written, the International Council of Shopping Centers, in conjunction with George Washington University, has developed a DVD to train mall security guards. According to Kavanaugh, about 6,000 of the nation's estimated 20,000 mall security guards have participated in the course, including 10 at Westroads Mall, where Wednesday's shootings took place. The FBI and other federal agencies have reached out to private security firms to share information on best practices. The FBI also sends out alerts regarding possible threats to the private sector -- but warnings of possible terrorist plans are clearly of no help in anticipating an attacker like Hawkins.

The RAND Corporation said one option would be for domestic intelligence to operate under the FBI. Canada has CSIS -- the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. Now Congress is asking: Should the U.S. have its own domestic intelligence agency? On Monday, at the request of Congress, the RAND Corporation outlined the pros and cons of establishing a domestic intelligence agency. It also discussed different ways to organize a new entity, either as part of an existing department or as a new agency. But there's one thing you won't find in the report -- a recommendation on what to do. \"We were not asked to make a recommendation, and this assessment does not do so,\" the report says. Instead, says RAND's Gregory Treverton, the report provides a \"framework\" for policymakers to use when deciding whether and how to reorganize counter-intelligence efforts at home. RAND is a nonprofit think tank seeking to help improve policy and decision making through objective research and analysis. Collecting intelligence domestically always has been a sensitive issue, at least partially because of episodic abuses by the government, notably against civil rights leaders, unions, antiwar organizations or even communists and hate groups. But the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks renewed calls for increased domestic intelligence to prevent future attacks. Critics said that in the lead-up to the attacks, the FBI devalued counterterrorism agents and failed to heed signs that an attack was imminent. \"If you didn't carry a gun, you didn't count so much,\" Treverton said. After the attacks, the FBI moved to transform its primary mission from law enforcement to counterterrorism intelligence and prevention. It now focuses on terrorism through its National Security Branch and the National Counterterrorism Center. The RAND report focuses on two options to the current system. In one, a new agency would be created using intelligence agencies from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and intelligence community. A second option is to create an \"agency within an agency\" in the FBI or DHS. The first option would result in an organization with a clear, unambiguous mission, and might be able to draw on a more diverse recruitment pool, such as linguists and historians who are not normally attracted to law enforcement. On the flip side, such massive reorganizations typically involve political compromises that could affect its performance. The second option -- an \"agency within an agency\" -- could involve less short-term disruption, but could be hindered by a \"lack of clarity of a single mission,\" the report says. RAND also suggests a range of actions short of reorganization that could improve domestic intelligence gathering, such as increasing resources, improving leadership and changing bureaucratic cultures. The report does not assess the FBI's performance since 9/11, Treverton said, but he believes Congress should seek an independent assessment. A panel of experts that RAND convened guessed that the probability of a terrorist attack had decreased about one-third since the September 11, 2001. But \"they were not enthusiastic about alternatives\" to current counterterrorism organizations. In a cautionary note, the report says that while public acceptance of domestic intelligence activities is imperative, public attitudes about what is considered acceptable \"can both be fragile and shift significantly over time.\" \"Public demand for domestic intelligence is driven by the perceived threat, and those perceptions can change much more rapidly than the threat itself,\" the report says. For instance, immediately after the 9/11 attacks, 49 percent of people surveyed were worried \"a great deal\" about more attacks. Two years later, that had dropped to 25 percent.", "fa935d1c258d53b991cab9e0ae5a5dbdcc6dc34d": "Founded in 1805 in Geneva, Pictet & Cie is today one of Switzerland's largest private banks, and one of the premier independent asset management specialists in Europe.

Kashmiris watch as Indian trucks cross into the border town of Chakothi in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. To cheers and band music, the first trucks rumbled from the Pakistani side across a white bridge to a brightly decorated trade center festooned . Apple-laden Indian trucks heading the other way were also warmly welcomed. It is hoped the move will ease tensions in the troubled Himalayan region, which has been a conflict flashpoint between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan who both lay claims to the territory. \"Today, we have regained our lost market,\" said Ghulam Rasool Bhat, president of the Kashmir fruit growers' association.  Watch more about the historic day \u00bb . \"We are sending the sweet Kashmir apple as the first consignment. This is sure to sweeten the relation between the two neighbors.

The trucks were subjected to thorough security checks before they crossed the bridge, one of the few crossing points in the heavily militarized 742-kilometer (460-mile) Line of Control, the de facto frontier that divides the region. Kashmir has been a major source of dispute between India, and Pakistan since the two countries were partitioned at the end of British rule in 1947. Muslim Kashmiris sided with Pakistan to the north, while the Hindu south joined India. For the past 18 years, Kashmir has been wracked by a bloody separatist campaign. Authorities say up to 43,000 people have died, but rights groups and non-governmental organizations put the death toll at twice that. Violence had dropped off since the countries began a peace process in 2004, but it surged after the state government in Indian-controlled Kashmir announced plans in June to donate land for a Hindu shrine. Muslim protests following the decision prompted a government U-turn that triggered Hindu demonstrations calling for it to be restored. Subsequent violence left 40 dead and hundreds wounded. It is hoped Tuesday's route opening will bolster the peace agreement and combat lingering mistrust between India and Pakistan. A bilateral cease-fire has been holding in the region for more than four years. A bus service connecting the divided Kashmir began amid much fanfare in 2005 but struggled under the weight of elaborate security checks and stifling bureaucracy. \"This is a great emotional moment, as it brings to mind my grandfather, who used to drive lorries on this road,\" said Muzhar Hussain Naqvi, who drove the leading Pakistani truck.

Ready for launch: video game programmer Richard Garriott shown in training for his space flight in October. Aside from the obvious financial limitations which restrict space tourism to the rich and the ridiculously rich, there are also significant training programs and testing to be completed before proceeding to lift-off. To gain a better insight into this training, well-known video game programmer and designer Richard Garriott, who is preparing for his own space adventure in October, is detailing in a blog what he and others have to go through in order to make it into orbit as a space traveler. Garriott has been in training since the beginning of the year and told CNN the first major thing to surprise him was the intensity of preparations. \"When I first came here in January, I thought nine months to get trained for this is going to be plenty of time. Of course, very quickly, I realized that I had signed up for a very complex task, something much more difficult that I had anticipated. I immediately knew that nine months was going to be a lot of work to get everything prepared for the flight. \"And now that I am so close to the flight, I am still feeling the pressure, I definitively have been working very long days and most nights,\" Garriott said. The training regime has three major strands: physical training, which includes preparation to acclimatize to the space environment; practical training for day-to-day living in space; and like any flight, be it 10 minutes or 10 days, training in safety procedures for emergency situations. Trainees generally spend nine months or more on and off-site to complete the requirements, which include everything from flight simulations to learning how to use the toilet. Eric Anderson, president and CEO of Space Adventures, the company sending Garriott into space, told CNN the training program is extensive, but does not exclude people from making the flight. \"Their total training program is a few months, but we tend to spread it out so they can fit it around their normal lives. They are not training to the same degree as the professionals.\" As long as space hopefuls are in reasonable health, they can usually go ahead with their adventure, he said. \"There's some fitness involved. There are certainly [medical] things that are not allowable in space, but they are generally more serious conditions.\" He said the major fitness issue with space travel was preparing for the change in \"Gs.\" \"The body is designed to live on one 'G,' so when you expose it to higher 'Gs' it has an effect. With the training and given the [short] length of the visits there's a minimal effect on the body.\" In his blog on the training process, Garriott said one part of the training was indisputably the worst. \"Hardest of all was the 'Spinning Chair of Ultimate Sickness.' I can't imagine that I will ever again voluntarily sit in a device designed to make you sick, or ride it as long as I can. Ugh, this is definitely my least favorite part of training!\" Despite such disturbing preparations, Anderson said much of the training, which takes place at Space Adventures' base in Star City, Russia, is centered upon general living in space. \"There's a few requirements about what you need to know to live in the space station ... how to eat, how to drink, and how to use the restroom, for example,\" he said. \"There's also a lot of simulation you go through ... there's preparation to acclimatize you to the space environment.\" Garriott said many of the procedures for living in space, or for emergencies, are very complex. \"There are a lot of technical details behind all the different systems we need to understand ... fire detection and alarms, plus procedures and equipment for dealing with fire emergencies; protective breathing apparatus in case of chamber decompression or malfunction; the toilet (everybody's favorite piece of space trivia!), including powering up the can for suction and waste removal; and lastly, onboard water sources.\" He admits the learning requirements had him preparing for exams by \"cramming like any good college kid.\" And the most fascinating part of the training? In Garriott's opinion, it was running in a hypobaric chamber, where the altitude was set at 10,000 meters (about 2,000 meters higher than Mount Everest). \"I felt no physical or mental problems, but I did notice an odd physiological issue that is quite hard to describe. Basically, it was possible to make a tennis ball-sized pocket in my mouth, but one which had no air in it as it was just a vacuum! \"By that I mean try to imagine creating a cavity inside your mouth without any air bubbles and by letting in no air through your lips or throat -- it's basically impossible at sea level because the air pressure outside your mouth pushes the air pocket closed,\" he said. \"However, at 10,000 meters the air is so much thinner that you can pull off this oral stunt without a hitch! Weird.\" It truly is.", "2f3c585affad41251e389d78f272c78d12055694": "(CNN)  -- Sen.

He will do an event in Indianapolis, Indiana, Thursday morning before leaving and will return to the campaign Saturday, Gibbs said. Michelle Obama will fill in for her husband on Friday at previously scheduled events in Columbus and Akron, Ohio, his campaign said. Obama speaks about his grandmother often on the stump, describing her as an integral figure in his youth who struggled against the glass ceiling in to make a better life for him. \"She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life,\" he said in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August. \"She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.\" He and his family traveled to Hawaii in August to visit her. The Obama team made the announcement after a busy day of trading attacks with Sen. John McCain on the Democratic presidential hopeful's readiness for office. Monday also marked the first time that Obama appeared with Sen. Hillary Clinton during the general election season. Clinton went to Florida, a state she won in the primary but whose delegates she could not claim, to urge her supporters to turn out for Obama on Election Day. Clinton called Orlando and central Florida \"the battleground of the battleground\" and practically begged the crowd to vote early. \"We are 15 days from the finish line and we cannot falter, we cannot stop, we cannot take a single vote for granted,\" Clinton said Monday. \"I am asking you to work as hard for Barack as you worked for me. If you made phone calls for me, make them for Barack. If you walked streets for me, make them for Barack. If you talked to your friends and neighbors for me, do it again for Barack.

Joe Biden, in which he said Obama would be tested within the first six months of his presidency. \"We don't want a president who invites testing from the world at a time when our economy is in crisis and Americans are already fighting in two wars,\" McCain said. \"What is more troubling is that Sen. Biden told their campaign donors that when that crisis hits, they would have to stand with them because it wouldn't be apparent Sen. Obama would have the right response. The Obama-Biden campaign released a pre-emptive response after reading McCain's scheduled remarks. \"With our nation facing two wars and 21st century threats abroad, Sen. Biden referenced the simple fact that history shows presidents face challenges from day one,\" Obama spokesman David Wade said. \"After eight years of a failed foreign policy, we need Barack Obama's good judgment and steady leadership, not the erratic and ideological Bush-McCain approach that has set back our security and standing in the world.\" Earlier Monday, Obama denounced the \"say-anything, do-anything politics\" of McCain's camp, but said \"careless, outrageous comments\" won't distract him from addressing the nation's ills. Obama added that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, McCain's running mate, rejected some of the tactics when she spoke out against a flood of automated phone calls tying Obama to former radical William Ayers. The calls were reported in several battleground states. \"It's getting so bad that even Sen. McCain's running mate denounced his tactics last night,\" Obama said at a campaign event in Tampa, Florida. \"As you know, you really have to work hard to violate Gov. Palin's standards on negative campaigning.\" Sunday night, Palin told reporters traveling with her that if she had her way, the McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee would not be flooding battleground states with the automated phone calls, which she said the Obama campaign was using too. Over the next 15 days, Obama said Monday, he will continue his quest for the Oval Office while disregarding the divisive politics that he said McCain is endorsing \"to keep us from working together.\" The McCain campaign, meanwhile, continued its weekend assault on Obama's tax plan, which it called an attempt to \"spread the wealth.\" iReport.com: Send your questions for Sen. John McCain . Speaking at a campaign event in St. Charles, Missouri, a chorus of boos rang out as the Arizona senator described his take on the plan. \"He believes in redistributing wealth -- not in policies that grow our economy and create jobs and opportunities for all Americans. Sen. Obama is more interested in controlling who gets your piece of the pie than in growing the pie.\" In Colorado Springs, Colorado, Palin also continued her line of attack from the weekend, but softened her tone in that she didn't call Obama's plan socialism.  Watch Palin say Obama sounds like a socialist \u00bb . Over the weekend, Palin and Sen. Mel Martinez, a Cuban-American GOP senator from Florida, called Obama's plan socialism. Martinez compared the plan to the tax structure in communist Cuba. McCain has taken a softer tone. On Sunday, he dodged a question from Fox News' Chris Wallace about whether Obama was a socialist, but said his rival's tax plan was an effort \"to spread the wealth.\" \"That's one of the tenets of socialism,\" McCain said.  Watch Obama defend his plan \u00bb . Obama's tax plan calls for tax relief for 95 percent of workers and their families.

He specifically slammed Palin's allegation that Obama's tax plan is socialist, calling it misleading. iReport.com: What do you think about Powell's endorsement? \"For us to say that makes you a socialist, I think, is an unfortunate characterization that isn't accurate.\"", "ef90046d39faf6cbf69fa9c2115878469defdaff": "(CNN) -- The parents of a Tennessee preacher shot to death by his wife convinced a judge to keep the convicted killer at home, but they couldn't keep her off the air. Mary Winkler describes her troubled marriage during a taped segrment of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" Seven months in custody wasn't a long enough sentence for what she did, Mary Winkler said Wednesday in an exclusive, pre-recorded interview with Oprah Winfrey. \"There's no amount of time I think you can put on something like this. I was just ready for them to lock the door and throw away the key,\" she told Winfrey. Winkler had sought permission to travel to Chicago, Illinois, to appear live on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show,\" but the judge who presided over her trial would not give her permission to travel. Her in-laws, who are suing Winkler for wrongful death and are seeking to revoke her parental rights, also fought the television appearance. Watch Winkler's interview with Oprah \u00bb . Winkler was convicted earlier this year of the shotgun slaying of her husband, Matthew, at the time the minister of the Fourth Street Church of Christ in Selmer, Tennessee. She told Winfrey that she killed her husband following years of abuse, including physical violence and being forced to dress \"slutty\" for undesirable sex acts. All she remembers, she said, is the \"boom\" as the shotgun went off. Winkler's account on the show was virtually identical to her testimony during her trial earlier this year. A jury of 10 women and one man found her guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Prosecutors had been pushing for a first-degree murder conviction. She was released last month from a Tennessee mental heath facility. Winfrey said on the show that Matthew Winkler's parents did not respond to requests for an interview. Dan and Diane Winkler, who have filed a $2 million wrongful-death suit against Mary Winkler, are pitched in a bitter custody battle over the couple's three daughters. The grandparents are trying to terminate her parental rights and adopt the three girls. Mary Winkler's attorney, Steve Farese, said a hearing in the case is scheduled for next week . During the trial, Diane Winkler chastised Mary for never apologizing to them or his children. Mary Winkler told Winfrey she is sorry she killed her husband and she would like a chance to sit down with her in-laws, whom she loves, misses and prays for every day. Asked by Winfrey what she would say to them, Winkler said she couldn't hone it down to two or three sentences. \"Just when that time comes, my heart will tell me what to say,\" she said. In her interview with Winfrey -- for a show titled \"The wife who killed her minister husband\" -- Winkler said tensions began when her husband tried to put their crying 1-year-old daughter, Brianna, back to sleep by \"covering her mouth and nose.\" \"I don't think he had intentions of killing; he just tried to get her to pass out,\" Winkler said, recounting the events just prior to her husband's March 2006 death at the church parsonage in Selmer, Tennessee. Winkler, then 31 and a mother of three, said she was used to his temper, saying, he often \"would just get irate with the baby monitor and Brianna crying.\" \"That's just something that would set him off,\" she told Winfrey. After putting Brianna to bed, she returned to the bedroom where Matthew was \"and I just wanted to talk to Matthew. And there's just that awful -- awful sound,\" she said, referring to the shotgun blast. Asked what she wanted to say to her husband when she went back to the bedroom, Winkler said, \"Just to stop. Be happy. He had to be miserable the way he acted and to just stop being so mean and just relax and enjoy life.\" She said she doesn't remember retrieving the shotgun from the closet, but she remembers thinking the gun was not loaded and that she \"never in a million years would've dreamed that there would've been something in that.\" \"I was so afraid,\" she said, adding that she feared for her life and it was \"not realistic\" to try reasoning with her husband. She doesn't know if she was using the gun to intimidate him or to get his attention, she said. \"When I heard the boom, I just thought that it would've hit the ceiling, the window. And I just thought, 'Oh my goodness, he's going to think I meant to do that on purpose' and so I took out of there and took off running,\" she said. \"At some point, I just realized he wasn't chasing me and I just had to go back in and face the realization.\" The realization was that the shotgun blast had sent 77 pellets into her husband's back. An autopsy report indicated he survived for a few minutes, said Winfrey, who grilled Winkler on what she did next. \"He was bleeding and it was just instinct to wipe his mouth, but it just kept coming. I didn't know how he was hurt. I couldn't see anything wrong with him,\" she said. \"When you actually see somebody that's just died, they just change appearance in a matter of seconds. It was just terrible.\" Winkler told Winfrey she had never fired a shotgun before she killed her husband, but he had turned the weapon on her in the past. He also had threatened more egregious violence, she said. \"Did he say he would chop you up?\" Winfrey asked. \"Yeah, he would do it himself,\" Winkler replied. \"He would do what?\" \"Chop me into a million pieces\" Winkler never stood up for herself, nor did she tell anyone about her husband's allegedly abusive behavior, she said, because she wanted to maintain the image of a perfect couple. She used makeup to cover up bruises. Her father, Clark Freeman, recalled to Winfrey a time he confronted her about her injuries. She just hung her head and said, \"Everything's all right. Everything's all right.\" Freeman said. Her husband also sexually abused her, Winkler said. He made her wear platform shoes and wigs and made her perform \"sexual acts that I didn't want to do.\" She said she regrets never standing up for herself, she said. \"That's where I will always grieve the fact that I failed Matthew in not bringing it to his attention how bad it was,\" she said.

Such telling video has rarely been shown by domestic media so extensively and so quickly after a national disaster. CCTV, China's state-run television network, as well as some local TV stations, have interrupted their regular programming to provide 24-hour coverage of the disaster. Field reporters give live reports of search-and rescue operations. News about China's deadly earthquake is being updated around the clock -- tallying death tolls, the horrendous damage and the government's swift response. Footage shows Premier Wen Jiabao surrounded by grieving villagers, his arms tightly holding two young girls. \"Your sorrow is our sorrow,\" he assures them. \"As long as people are still alive, we can start all over again.\" Premier Wen traveled to the disaster areas within hours of the massive earthquake. Chinese television covered his movements while leading rescue operations and comforting people in distress. Wearing a hard hat, he was shown standing on rubble and consoling trapped survivors through a loud speaker. The message is compelling: This disaster is terrible but the government is doing everything it can. Such swift reaction and extensive news coverage has not been seen in previous disasters. When the Great Tangshan earthquake struck 32 years ago, the Chinese media kept the information secret for a long time, even though over 240,000 people were killed. In the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak, domestic media downplayed reports on the deadly epidemic, even as it spiraled out of control and spread globally. More recently, severe snowstorms hit southern China during Spring Festival, the nation's most important holiday. Local media initially downplayed the crisis, following the government's cue; Premier Wen Jiabao was later forced to apologize for the government's slow response. With the Beijing Olympics just three months away, China is in the spotlight. Wenran Jiang, acting director of the Chinese Institute at the University of Alberta, believes the nation has drawn lessons from its past experiences with disaster. \"China made mistakes before. They seemed to have learned their lessons from the earlier episodes and this one -- they probably want to manage it as well as they can.\"  Watch latest report on rescue efforts \u00bb . Why China's new approach? Jiang notes that \"the media follow-up is quite transparent,\" in part because it \"is politically less sensitive covering such a natural disaster.\" Besides, Chinese officials see tangible benefits in allowing media transparency. By showing the leaders helping people and coordinating search and rescue efforts, he explains, \"the result is that the whole [of] China is being mobilized. The disaster has now become a rallying point of the country.\" Experts in the region note the stark contrast between China's open response in the aftermath of the earthquake and Myanmar's defensive, clumsy response in the aftermath of a deadly cyclone earlier this month. Unlike its southern neighbor, China appears open to accepting international help and providing accurate information. Chinese officials say they welcome offers of sympathy and international assistance. Aid groups have been on standby, ready to help as soon as the Chinese government gives the green light. Officials say that will come \"when the time is ripe.\" Today's more open, quick and aggressive reporting is a stark departure from China's poor performance in recent years.", "d8d60a674734566dde9151812d0662ad43caf140": "(CNN) -- The Rev. Rick Warren, often called America's most influential pastor, will be hosting Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain for what's being called the civil forum on the presidency. Rick Warren will be hosting the civil forum on the presidency . Warren, who heads up the country's fourth largest church, is also an author whose books have sold more than 30 million copies. The candidates will appear together at Warren's 20,000-member Saddleback mega-church in southern California where they each will be interviewed for an hour. Warren spoke with John Roberts on CNN's American Morning about what he hopes to accomplish at the forum. John Roberts: What do you want to hear from candidates Saturday night? Rick Warren: You know, John, we're going to look at four different segments. One is a segment on leadership. What is the personal character, competence, and experience of each of these guys. One section will be on what I call stewardship -- the role and responsibility of presidency, what they believe about the constitution, the role of America. We're going to look at a section on world view -- all of the minefield questions that no matter how you answer them, somebody's not going to like it. Then we're going to look at America's role internationally. How we've been a blessed nation and how should we bless others. Roberts: Are you going to ask them about issues like abortion and same-sex marriage? Pro-life advocates are hoping you do. There has been some criticism in some corners you have been soft-pedaling political issues that are central to evangelicals. Warren: I think everybody will be surprised. I'm going to ask all of the tough questions. I just intend to ask them in a civil way. This is called a civil forum, which means you can disagree without demonizing the opposition. I think everybody wants to hear questions not just about those \"moral issues,\" but also about a lot of other things, too. I'm trying to stake out a common ground for the common good. Roberts: When you take a look at the evangelical vote in 2004, George Bush captured more than 75 percent of people who identify themselves as either born again or evangelical. Our recent polling, CNN Opinion Research Corporation polls, found when it comes to John McCain, only 67 percent of evangelicals say they'll support him. Are you surprised at the shift? Warren: It's interesting to me. Both of these men have been around for some time. Obama's written two books. Still a lot of people say, I'd like to know the real person. What are they really like? I'm hoping that'll happen in this forum. Evangelicals have never been a monolithic voting base. Never. And the people who try to predict which way they're going to go in this election I think may be surprised after Election Day. You don't really know. I don't know, and I don't think anybody knows. Roberts: As you know, John McCain in 2000 during the primaries ran afoul of evangelicals when he criticized Pat Robinson. He's tried to repair the relationship. Has he gone far enough? Warren: The religious right, fundamentalists and evangelic evangelicals aren't synonyms for each other. I think John may have been talking about certain groups that he was worried about at that time. But he certainly rebuilt bridges among them today. It's just a question of whether they're going to vote on his issues or if they're going to vote on Obama's, and we'll see. Roberts: As for you yourself in the most recent edition of Time magazine on which you're the cover, they've suggested you're evolving into the \"superpolitical.\" Others have suggested you're becoming a spiritual entrepreneur. What do you make of the titles people are ascribing to you? Warren: When you try to line out a middle ground -- common ground for the common good of America -- you get pot shots from both sides. If I were just the left, I'd only get it from the right. If I were just the right, I'd only get it from the left. Because I believe in the monogood and don't happen to think either party gets it right all the time. I don't think anybody bats 1,000. I get it from both sides.

Barak Obama speaks at a campaign rally in Coral Gables, Florida, Friday. \"We must also help Main Street,\" he said. While \"tough new regulations on financial institutions\" are needed, the Illinois senator called for an emergency economic plan for working families. Obama spoke after meeting with his economic advisers in Coral Gables, Florida. Watch  Obama call for help for Main Street \u00bb . Obama on Friday also backed administration and congressional leaders' efforts to develop a \"a more stable and permanent solution\" to the U.S. financial crisis. Watch Obama talk about how working Americans need help in this economy . Obama's statement came after Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox met with congressional leaders to discuss a plan that would allow banks to get rid of bad mortgage-related assets that have been a drag on their balance sheets. \"What we're looking at right now is to provide the Treasury and the Federal Reserve with as broad authority as necessary to stabilize markets and maintain credit,\" Obama said. \"We need a more institutional response to create a system that can manage some of the underlying problems with bad mortgages, help homeowners stay in their homes, protect the retirement and savings of working Americans.\" After meeting with his economic advisors, Obama said his team would not present a detailed economic plan at this time, \"given the gravity of this situation, and based on conversations I have had with both Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke.\" Obama said he would not present his plan until the Treasury and Federal Reserve have presented theirs. \"It is critical at this point that the markets and the public have confidence that their work will be unimpeded by partisan wrangling, and that leaders in both parties work in concert to solve the problem at hand,\" Obama said. Later, Obama held a rally, at the University of Miami, which was disrupted by protesters who held up signs saying \"Blacks against Obama\" and \"Obama endorsed by the KKK.\" Obama said the protesters could stay and hold up their signs if they stopped shouting, but they were later escorted out after they continued to disrupt the rally. Obama spoke after Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain said Friday morning that he would establish a new agency to deal with the U.S. financial crisis that many experts say is the worst since the Great Depression.  Watch McCain blast Washington corruption \u00bb . That agency, a Mortgage and Financial Institutions trust, would work with the private sector and regulators to identify institutions that are weak and fix them before they go broke. \"The underlying principle of the MFI or any approach considered by Congress should be to keep people in their homes and safeguard the life savings of all Americans by protecting our financial system and capital markets,\" McCain told the Green Bay Chamber of Commerce in Wisconsin. McCain said the agency would be an early intervention program to help financial institutions avoid bankruptcy, expensive bailouts and damage to their customers. Obama, at the rally in Florida, lashed out at McCain's plan. \"This morning Sen. McCain gave a speech in which his big solution to this worldwide economic crisis was to blame me for it. \"This is a guy who spent nearly three decades in Washington and after spending the entire campaign saying I haven't been in Washington long enough ... he apparently now is willing to assign me responsibility for all of Washington's failure,\" he said. Wall Street witnessed the federal government take unprecedented steps this week to stabilize the economy, including the takeover of the insurance giant American International Group Inc. in exchange for an $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve. In his speech, McCain blamed the crisis on \"the corruption and manipulation of our home mortgage system\" and blasted Congress and the administration for not addressing the problems at the two mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which he said \"led our housing system down a path where quick profit was placed before sound finance.\" McCain also blasted his Democratic rival, Sen. Barack Obama, for not working to clean up the \"corruption\" at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fact Check: Did Obama 'profit' from Fannie and Freddie? \"We've heard a lot of words from Sen. Obama over the course of this campaign. But maybe just this once he could spare us the lectures and admit to his own poor judgment in contributing to these problems. The crisis on Wall Street started in the Washington culture of lobbying and influence peddling, and he was square in the middle of it.\" Although action must be taken to avoid future panics, the Arizona Republican said that ultimately, the economy would have to grow to get through \"this tough time for America.\" McCain touted his economic plan, which includes tax cuts, and again said Obama would increase taxes on Americans who make as little as $42,000. McCain's charge that his opponent would raise taxes on those making $42,000 is misleading, however. The McCain campaign cites Obama's vote for a nonbinding 2008 budget resolution that outlines budget priorities through 2013 and assumed that President Bush's tax cuts would expire in 2011. Fact Check: Does Obama want to raise taxes? The Obama campaign says its economic plan would raise taxes only on those making over $250,000. The economic crisis has given Obama and his running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, the opportunity to go on the offensive. Most Americans see Obama as more capable than McCain when it comes to the economy, polls indicate. The two campaigns have traded shots all week, most recently over the government takeover of AIG. As the economy has dominated the headlines, Obama has widened his lead over McCain, according to CNN's latest \"poll of polls.\" Obama gains in national polls .", "1080f37d7e221219c9d301f8afaabc83e43addb4": "(CNN)  -- A tugboat on Saturday reached a disabled freighter carrying 22 people, hours after the ship rode out Hurricane Ike without power, Coast Guard spokesman Mike O'Berry said. O'Berry said the tugboat Rotterdam arrived shortly before 2 p.m. (3 p.m. ET). Repairs will be made aboard the Antalina, which has a broken fuel pump, while at sea, O'Berry said. The tugboat will then tow the ship to Port Arthur, Texas, where it will undergo additional repairs and eventually offload more of its cargo -- petroleum coke, a petroleum byproduct -- O'Berry said. The crew members aboard the Antalina, a Cypriot-flagged freighter, are all in good health, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Ron Labrec. The freighter suffered no major damage from the storm, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesman for the company that manages the ship. Aircraft from the Coast Guard and Air Force were sent Friday afternoon to try to rescue the crew of the freighter, which is loaded with petroleum coke, a petroleum byproduct. But high winds forced the military to abort the rescue, O'Berry said. The Coast Guard then instructed the freighter to contact it each hour. It also told told the crew to turn on the ship's emergency radio beacon so its position could be monitored, O'Berry said.  Watch the Coast Guard conduct a rescue operation \u00bb . Onshore as well, rescuers found it too dangerous to respond to calls for help. In Liverpool, Texas, south of Houston, a family called for help around 1 a.m. Saturday when a tree crashed into their house, but authorities concluded that strong winds made it too dangerous to respond, said Doc Adams, Brazoria County's emergency management coordinator. \"You want to take care of people, and when you can't, it's tough,\" Adams said. \"Unfortunately, someone has to make the decision about whether the risk is worth the benefit. Are you willing to risk three or four lives to save one? It's not easy.\" Adams said he didn't know if anyone in the house was hurt. \"As far as I know, they're still there in the house with a tree over it,\" he said at about 3:40 a.m. The stranded freighter had been headed south through the Gulf of Mexico from Port Arthur, Texas, but \"lost main propulsion 90 miles southeast of Galveston\" and was unable to steer, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard received a distress call from the vessel at 4 a.m. Friday. The Antalina was \"basically adrift, at the mercy of the wind and sea currents,\" Coast Guard Petty Officer Tom Atkeson said at the time. \"We are in hell,\" one of the men aboard the freighter told CNN on Friday before the rescue was called off. The man said the winds around the ship were strong but that the freighter still had power. On Friday before the storm hit, authorities picked up more than 120 people stranded by rising seas along the southeast Texas coast. Most of the rescues occurred in Galveston County, where rising water and other effects of the storm began hours before landfall early Saturday. Stranded residents were airlifted from Crystal Beach, Bolivar Peninsula and other communities in the Galveston area. Many of those rescued were motorists stranded on flooded roads. In Surfside Beach, police waded through chest-high rushing water to rescue five people trapped in their homes. One man refused to leave, said Surfside Beach police Chief Randy Smith. \"Some of them took convincing, some of them didn't,\" Smith said. Police also rescued five other people who waded out to meet the officers. About half of those rescues were done by helicopters out of bases along the coast, said Coast Guard Petty Officer David Schulein. Three HH-65C helicopters from Coast Guard Air Station Houston rescued more than 20 people and continued to fly rescue missions until weather grounded them Friday evening, said Petty Officer Renee Aiello, a station spokeswoman. Some 37,000 people may need to be rescued in the aftermath of the hurricane, a U.S. military official estimated Friday. Texas already has asked for help, and the active-duty military has 42 search-and-rescue helicopters on standby, the official said.", "43ba8c49ed06c4732f3c67be1dcce1303c947eed": "Editor's Note: Republican strategist Alex Castellanos was a former campaign consultant for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign and has worked on more than half a dozen presidential campaigns. Castellanos is a partner in National Media Inc., a political and public affairs consulting firm that specializes in advertising. He has produced many Republican political ads and has clients such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Alex Castellanos says Barack Obama's change theme has buckled to \"top-down liberalism.\" (CNN) -- In theater, they say the second act is the hardest to write. It requires relentless focus and discipline. The writer must give himself fearlessly to one central idea and never waver, though temptation is the opposite: There are many paths a story can take. So it is in politics, as Barack Obama's campaign is learning. The clear campaign of change ran into trouble in Act II when it was tasked with explaining what change actually meant. Obama, as they say in show business, \"ran out of script.\" The wind in his sails stalled in the hot calm of August and he has yet to recover. After John McCain's improbable resuscitation to seize the GOP nomination, the Arizona senator's top aides briefed him about his exacting challenge: He would go into the conventions trailing Obama by at least 8 percentage points and then battle back through the fall to parity. Yet, as cooler days and hotter rhetoric mark the start of the fall finale, it is Obama who finds himself clawing back, forced to attack, launching uncharacteristic partisan and personal attacks against a McCain who has \"lost track\" of and is \"confused\" about how many houses he owns. How did the soaring campaign of change become grinding politics-as-usual and crash so thunderously to earth? The Obama campaign's clear message in the primaries was a bottom-up, organic populism that cast voters themselves as the agents of change. \"We are the change we have been waiting for,\" Obama told his supporters during the primaries. In return, they sang, \"Yes we can.\" This heady mix of populism and change swelled his campaign into a cause. In marketing terms, it is called \"voter as hero.\" Obama empowered his supporters, telling them they, not the old political establishment, could achieve anything. Bottom-up politics is one thing, however. Bottom-up government, another. When Barack Obama became the nominee of the national Democratic establishment, the candidate of hope ran into political reality: His party's canons of governing are the opposite of change. Barack Obama may believe \"change doesn't come from the top down, it comes from the bottom up,\" but the leadership of his party doesn't. The national Democratic establishment, from the Daily Kos and MoveOn.org to Pelosi and Reid in Congress, still believe in top-down big-government from Washington, especially if they get to run the factory. Politically, they are industrial-age dinosaurs . They believe the era of big government is back, not over. They would keep money and power in their hands, not devolve it to the average American. That was not something the Denver Democrats were eager to confess. Instead, they advocated a sly European-style socialism that would not speak its intent. \"Decent, quality health care as a fundamental right and not a privilege,\" the Democrats offered during the first night of their convention. A big-government health-care factory run by Washington? That's change? Why not the same for food, clothing and shelter? But relax, Joe Lunchbucket, an even bigger public-sector industrial plant will impose no cost on your family. Obama's party promises not to tax you, just business -- the people who sell you your groceries and gasoline and sign your paychecks. As Fred Thompson noted in his GOP convention speech, \"They won't take any water out of your side of the bucket. Just the other side.\" This is not \"voter as hero\" but, instead, \"voter as victim.\" A heroic Washington has all the money, the power, and the answers. Same old, same old. So the candidate of change fell silent. And he sang change never again. Barack Obama could have spoken truth to power. He could have pledged to confront the Democratic Party establishment. He could have brought a more natural, organic era of bottom-up government, not just bottom-up politics, to a dated party clinging to a decaying philosophy of authority. But when the irresistible force of Obama's bottom-up politics met the immovable object of Democratic Party power, it was the dream, not the power, that conceded. \"Yes we can\" turned out to mean not \"Yes the people can\", just \"Yes Washington can.\" Too bad. It would have refreshed the Democratic Party and the country. This movie is not new: The candidate who runs to change the establishment doesn't. Instead, we see it change him. The hope for real change in Washington has been suffocated by an older generation's embrace. Now, Barack Obama finds himself trapped without a post-partisan message. Instead of challenging politics-as-usual, he sells the usual partisan politics: \"Bush-McCain\", he shouts from rooftops, sounding like every other Democrat in the chorus, pretending partisanship is fresh. The story? Bottom-up change ran into top-down liberalism. Old-fashioned liberalism won. That's Act II. Stand by for the play's end.

The unmanned lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1, or \"moon craft\" in ancient Sanskrit, came at 6:20 a.m. Wednesday (8:50 p.m. ET) from the Sriharikota space center in southern India. The two-year mission seeks high-resolution imaging of the moon's surface, especially the permanently shadowed polar regions, according to the Indian Space Research Organization.

Despite the numerous missions to the moon over the past 50 years, \"we really don't have a good map of the moon,\" said Miles O'Brien, CNN chief technology and environment correspondent. \"The goal is to come up with a very intricate, three-dimensional map of the moon.\" The Chandrayaan-1 is carrying payloads from the United States, European Union countries Germany, Britain, Sweden and Bulgaria, and India plans to share the data from the mission with other programs, including NASA.  Watch the launch of India's first lunar mission \u00bb . ISRO said on its Web site that the mission would lay the groundwork for future lunar missions and \"probe the physical characteristics of the lunar surface in greater depth than previous missions by other nations.\" \"It will also give us a deeper understanding about the planet Earth itself or its origins,\" a statement on the Web site said. \"Earlier missions did not come out with a full understanding of the moon and that is the reason scientists are still interested. This will lay the foundation for bigger missions and also open up new possibilities of international networking and support for planetary programs.\" Until now, India's space launches have been more practical, with weather warning satellites and communiations systems, The Associated Press cited former NASA associated administrator Scott Pace as saying. To date, only the U.S. Russia, the European Space Agency, Japan and China have sent missions to the moon, according to AP. Critics of the mission have questioned its $80 million price tag, saying the money should have been spent by the government to improve education and fight poverty. But, \"there are scientists that would argue that there are plenty of things we don't know about the moon ... and India might have the know-how\" to find answers, said CNN's Sara Sidner in New Delhi. The United States and the Soviet Union dominated the field of lunar exploration from the late 1950s. The United States is preparing for its own mission slated for next spring -- the first U.S. lunar mission in more than a decade, according to NASA. Soviet spacecraft were the first to fly by, land on and orbit the moon. Luna 1, launched on January 2, 1959, and sped by the moon two days later. Luna 2 was launched on an impact mission on September 12, 1959, striking the surface two days later. Luna 9 launched on January 31, 1966, becoming the first craft to successfully land on the moon and send back data, touching down on the surface on January 31, 1966, and transmitting until February 3, 1967, when its batteries ran out. Luna 10 was launched March 31, 1966, entered lunar orbit on April 3, and operated for 56 days. But the United States' Apollo missions were the first manned missions to reach the moon, culminating with six missions that set down on the surface. The first, Apollo 11, left earth on July 16, 1969, and landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin on the lunar surface on July 20 while command module pilot Michael Collins orbited above. The astronauts returned safely to earth on July 24. Most recently India's fellow Asian nations, China and Japan, put lunar orbiters in place. Japan launched the Kaguya orbiter in October 2007, followed by China's launch of the Chang'e mission a few weeks later.

A truck burns at the gate to the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad before a larger, deadly explosion Saturday. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the Saturday attack at the Marriott Hotel \"is the biggest attack, volume-wise\" in Pakistan in seven years. Two American military personnel who worked for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad were among those killed, the U.S. military said. A Lithuanian and the Czech Republic's ambassador to Pakistan, Ivo Zdarek, also were among the fatalities, police superintendent Sheikh Zubair said. The suicide truck blast injured 266 people, including 11 foreigners, according to Malik.  Watch guards scatter after an explosion \u00bb . British Airways temporarily suspended its flights to Islamabad as a result of the security situation, according to an airline spokeswoman who did not want to be named. A Sunday night flight has been canceled, and the airline is reviewing its operations for later in the week. British Airways operates at least three flights a week to the Pakistani capital out of London's Heathrow Airport. At a news conference in Islamabad on Sunday, Pakistani authorities released security video of the blast, showing a small explosion inside the truck before the larger, deadly explosion. Watch the truck bomb caught on tape . In the video, a large truck crashes into the security gate, sending one security officer scurrying for safety. Then, as security guards approach the truck, the top of the vehicle explodes and the security guards flee. A small cloud of smoke appears above the truck, which is engulfed in flames minutes later. One of the security guards tries to put out the fire with a hand-held extinguisher, to no avail. The guards then walk away, and the camera freezes on the burning truck. Pakistani officials said the blast apparently disrupted electricity to the area, causing the closed-circuit television camera to malfunction. No arrests have been made in connection with the attack, Malik said Sunday, adding that militants in Pakistan's tribal regions are suspected of orchestrating the attack. \"I am not in a position to tell you who has done it, but [in] all the previous investigations, all the roads have gone to South Waziristan,\" he said. South Waziristan is one of Pakistan's seven tribal areas where Taliban and al Qaeda militants are active. At the bombing site, video showed a deep crater in the pavement where the bomb detonated. More than a dozen cars were reduced to twisted steel. The crater was 24 feet deep and nearly 60 feet wide, Malik said. The blast also caused a natural gas leak that set the top floor of the five-story, 258-room hotel on fire, police said. The blaze quickly engulfed the entire structure.  Watch a witness describe walking over bodies \u00bb . Most of the fatalities appeared to be drivers, who were waiting with their cars outside the Marriott, and hotel security guards, Geo TV's Hamid Mir said. The hotel, where a standard room costs more than $300 per night, is near the compound that contains the Parliament building, the prime minister's house, the Supreme Court and the presidency. The blast occurred about 7:50 p.m., after the breaking of the fast during the holy month of Ramadan, Malik said. Trees were felled by the explosion, which occurred hours after newly elected President Asif Ali Zardari addressed a joint session of Parliament and promised to root out terrorism.  Watch the scene the morning after the blast \u00bb . A few hours after the attack, Zardari addressed the nation on television, saying he knows the pain of terrorism after his wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was killed in December on the campaign trail. \"My heart cries tears of blood. I can understand your pain. I want to ask you to turn this pain into your strength,\" he said, describing extremism as \"a cancer, which we will finish.\" \"In the holy month of Ramadan, no Muslim can act in this way. These people are not Muslims,\" he said. \"I appeal to all democratic nations to help us get rid of this menace.\" The Marriott, a Western brand-name hotel, has been the site of attacks in the past.  See where the attack occurred \u00bb . Malik said authorities had received a threat against Parliament two days ago. \"We had taken all security measures,\" he said. \"There was heavy security in the city.\" Located near the diplomatic section of the city and heavily guarded by police and the military, the hotel is popular among tourists and had been packed Saturday night. Any vehicle entering the facility is searched, its underside checked for bombs, before it is allowed to pass through heavy steel gates.  Watch bombing victims rushed into hospital \u00bb .

Banita Jacks, 33, is charged with three counts of felony murder and one count of first-degree murder while armed. The victims, who range in age from 5 to 17 years, are thought to be her daughters. Their bodies were found when U.S. marshals served an eviction notice at Jacks' apartment in southeast Washington, D.C. Court documents say Jacks identified the victims as her daughters Brittany Jacks, 17; Tatianna Jacks, 11; N'kiah Fogle, 6; and Aja Fogle, 5. Earlier Thursday, Mayor Adrian Fenty said the bodies' decomposition has hindered their identification, although they were believed to be Jacks' children. Marie Pierre-Louis, Washington's chief medical examiner, said all four of the girls had been dead for at least 15 days. Jacks is being held without bail. Her next court appearance is scheduled for February 11. If convicted, she could receive a maximum sentence of life in prison. Jacks told police that her daughters were possessed by demons and that each died in her sleep during a seven- to 10-day period, court documents said. Aja died first, she told police, then N'kiah, Tatianna and Brittany. \"She said that as the first three younger children died, she placed them side by side in the room in which they died,\" according to court documents. She reported that all the deaths occurred sometime before the electricity in her house was disconnected, which records show was September 5, 2007, documents said. Jacks said she never tried to call authorities to remove the bodies \"because she didn't trust either agency and because she thought if she notified emergency personnel, that would cause her more problems,\" the documents said. She also said she had not fed her daughters food \"for a substantial period of time prior to their deaths.\" No one besides herself or the children had been in the home since May 2007, Jacks said. Pierre-Louis ruled the deaths homicides, according to a court document.  Watch Pierre-Louis describe the condition of the bodies \u00bb . Preliminary findings are that Brittany was stabbed to death and that Aja died from blunt-force impact to the back of her head and possible ligature strangulation. Both Tatianna and N'kiah also had \"apparent ligature evidence\" on their necks that was \"somewhat more defined than that noted on Aja Fogle's neck,\" court documents said. However, the documents said, further tests are needed to confirm the causes of the deaths. All four children were wearing white T-shirts and were discovered in unfurnished bedrooms -- three in one and a fourth in another, the documents said. \"What appeared to be a metal steak knife\" was found next to the fourth. Also, the fourth body was found in a bedroom with hardwood floors, and a T-shirt with duct tape was found at the bottom of the bedroom door, filling the gap between the floor and the bottom of the door when it was closed. A witness told police they saw Jacks treat Brittany differently from her other children, sometimes withholding food from her while feeding the others, court documents said. In addition, the witness said Jacks once drove Brittany to Jacks' mother's home in Waldorf, Maryland, and left her there. Jacks' mother was not home, the witness said, and Brittany was left on the porch unattended for more than 10 hours. City officials are trying to determine how the children could have been dead for at least two weeks without anyone noticing their absence. Fenty said the city had determined that Jacks' children were \"in and out of the public school system\" and that the child welfare caseworkers and the metropolitan police had each had at least \"one contact\" with the family.  Watch Fenty explain how a \"routine\" eviction became a death investigation \u00bb . \"There may be other contacts with the government ... in the case of the Jacks family,\" he said.

Inspectors looking at F/A-18 fighter jets have found 15 with stress crack problems on the wings. Some 636 F/A-18 A through D model Hornets in both the Navy and the Marine Corps are being inspected for stress cracks on a hinge connecting the aileron to the flaps on the back side of the wings, according to Navy spokesmen. Inspectors started looking at the planes Thursday and have found 15 aircrafts with the problem. A panel on the wing can be swapped out with a new one to get rid of the problem. The Navy is still looking at the hinge in question to see whether the problem is severe enough to ground the Hornets and come up for a permanent fix for the hinge. Navy officials said there are no immediate plans to ground the 636 planes. This month, a post-flight inspection of one F/A-18 found a crack, and it was determined to be systemic enough to warrant an inspection of the older F/A-18s, according to Navy officials. The Navy also flies the Super Hornet, a newer version of the F/A-18. That plane is not part of this inspection.

But that was before she came to the Games in China, which has undergone a major change in its treatment of the mentally disabled. Hong Kong's Special Olympics team marches into the stadium during last week's opening ceremony. \"They are able to accept special needs people in a way that maybe some other countries do not,\" Williams says. Last week, organizers rolled out the red carpet for athletes arriving at the Special Olympics in Shanghai, China. Never before in the 39-year history of the Special Olympics has there been such an extravagant, star-studded opening ceremony. And everywhere in this city, there are billboards with the smiling faces of the mentally disabled promoting the Games. China spent millions ensuring the 7,500 competitors are cared for -- and more importantly accepted.  Watch 'This is a highlight to their lives' \u00bb . That's quite a turnaround for a country whose leadership, less than 20 years ago, refused to even acknowledge any of their citizens were intellectually disabled. At the time, former Prime Minister Li Peng was quoted as saying, \"Mentally retarded people give birth to idiots.\" \"There's a long way to go -- there's a long way. But the good news is we're moving,\" says Tim Shriver, chairman of the Special Olympics. China's transformation is so far mostly from the top down, beginning with no less than President Hu Jintao whose presence at the Opening Ceremony was particularly notable.  See photos of the opening ceremony \u00bb . Also notable was the president's visit to one of Shanghai's \"Sunshine Homes\" this month. The shelters are a direct result of this city winning the rights five years ago to host the Special Olympics. Back then, officials quickly realized their treatment of the city's 70,000 mentally disabled was woefully inadequate. Now there are 240 Sunshine Homes spread across this sprawling city, caring for about 15,000 of those most in need, like 25-year-old Chen Xiaohan. She still struggles to speak with strangers, but her parents boast of her many achievements since enrolling a year ago. Xiaohan can make her own bed, walk to school and is learning piano. But more notable, says her father, Chen Zhixiang, is the change in recent years in the way his daughter is treated by neighbors. \"If in the past you looked down on them and now you still look down, it only proves your thinking is bad. Now when our neighbors see her, they're very nice. They ask, 'Chen Xiaohan, how are you today?' There isn't any more discrimination.\" The Special Olympics may have been a watershed moment for China's mentally disabled, but perhaps a breakthrough came a few years earlier, when Special Olympian Judy Yang appeared in a splashy spread on the front cover of a mainstream teen-age magazine. Photogenic and well-spoken, Yang has been an unofficial ambassador of sorts and, after her magazine debut, she noticed a real shift in how the Chinese related to the disabled. \"A lot of people are accepting now. They're willing to be friends, to let their children play with one another, and they can learn from each other as well.\" That may be true in China's biggest, richest and most Western city, Shanghai, but in the countryside not much appears to have changed. Intellectually disabled children that are hard to manage are often locked in caged rooms. Humanitarian officials say stories of doctors recommending disabled children be killed at birth are common. In addition, programs like Sunshine Homes are almost unheard of outside of Shanghai and caring for the almost 13 million intellectually disabled in China remains a major challenge. Earlier this year, authorities exposed a human trafficking ring selling young men, many of them intellectually disabled,  to work in brick kilns. \"Neglect and discrimination is still quite prevalent. People tend to be ashamed of children with disabilities. They tend to hide them away. They tend not to let them have access to schooling or education,\" says Yin Yin Nwe, the head of UNICEF in China. But Nwe is optimistic. As China's economy grows, she said she thinks the government will continue to devote more resources to the country's weakest and most vulnerable.

More than 1,200 others have been sickened, according to China's Health Ministry. Of that number, 340 infants are hospitalized and 53 are considered to be in serious condition. Government inspectors are testing baby formula around China and plan to release their results on Tuesday, said Li Changjiang, head of the State Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, according to the Xinhua news agency. The manufacturer, Sanlu Group, has recalled more than 8,200 tons of the tainted formula following reports of babies developing kidney stones, Xinhua said.  Watch what Sanlu has done \u00bb . Sanlu, one of China's leading dairy producers, has also sealed off more than 2,100 tons of contaminated product, and another 700 tons still need to be recalled, the news agency said. It is not the first time Sanlu has been connected to a scandal involving tainted milk powder, according to China Daily. In 2004, at least 13 infants in the eastern Anhui province died of malnutrition after drinking milk powder that had little to no nutrition. The illegally manufactured milk was falsely labeled with the Sanlu brand, according to the paper. More than 170 other babies were hospitalized as a result of drinking the cheap milk powder. Chinese police have questioned 78 people -- including dairy farmers and milk dealers -- about the most recent contamination, a Chinese official told Xinhua Saturday. Sanlu would not say whether its employees are being investigated, Xinhua said. Testing by Sanlu found tripolycyanamide, also known as melamine, in 700 tons of its product, said Zhao Xinchao, the vice mayor of Shijiazhuang, the news agency reported. Zhao told the news agency that the suspects added water to the milk they sold to Sanlu to make more money, then added the chemical so the diluted milk could still meet standards. Inspectors found the chemical in Sanlu infant formula produced by one of the company's partner producers in northwest Gansu Province, an official said Sunday. Two of 12 samples randomly selected from the Sanlu milk powder produced by the Haoniu Dairy Company in Jiuquan City tested positive for melamine, said Xian Hui, the vice-governor of Gansu. Health experts say ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones, urinary tract ulcers, and eye and skin irritation. The chemical is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. Hundreds of Wal-Mart and Carrefour stores in China are pulling the Sanlu milk powder from their shelves, Xinhua said. This episode marks the latest in a string of tainted products produced in China. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalled more than 150 brands of cat and dog food last year after finding that some pets became ill or died after eating food tainted with melamine, the same chemical found in the powdered milk. Two Chinese businesses, a U.S. company and top executives of each were indicted by a federal grand jury in February in connection with tainted pet food, which resulted in deaths and serious illnesses in up to thousands of U.S. pets, federal prosecutors said. In October 2007, regulators and retailers in the United States recalled at least 69,000 Chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint, which can cause hazardous lead poisoning. In November, shipments of the popular toy Aqua Dots were found to have been contaminated with a toxic chemical that turned into a powerful \"date rape\" drug if swallowed, causing some children who ate the craft toys to vomit and lose consciousness. And in February, a Maryland candy distributor pulled Pokemon-brand Valentine lollipops from store shelves after bits of metal were found in the sealed treats, authorities said.

The \"OverEater\" is one of the nine types of men that women should avoid. My pal Annie likes preppy men -- but only after they've gone to seed and become a little bloated in the process. Suzanne has a weakness for thin Japanese guys who like indie rock music, while Maddy adores bike messengers of all shapes and sizes. But there are certain types of guys who should be NOBODY'S type. These guys are distinguished by one thing -- an overabundance of one or more very bad qualities. Here's your guide to boys to avoid: . 1. The OverSharer: The current Overshare Poster Boy is Phillip Nobel, who wrote a highly hide-chapping account of his extramarital affair for Elle. The Oversharer will broadcast intimate episodes from your relationship to his mother, your mother, his blog readers and anyone else he can rope into paying attention. 2. The OverThinker: One of the great things about dating men is that you aren't subjected to long, excruciating interrogations over what you really meant when you reassured him that no, he didn't look fat in those pants. However, though they're rare birds, there are guys who will want to spend hours dissecting even the most innocuous comment, examining it for tone, content and what you might've been implying. 3. The OverTalker: Your friends say they've never known you to be so quiet. That's because this man does enough talking for both of you (and then some). When you do finally eke out a sentence or two he interrupts and talks over you anyway. You have two choices -- accept the fact that you will never speak again or tell him goodbye. Your call. 4. The OverDresser: This dandy makes Gossip Girl's Chuck Bass look sloppy and mismatched. That he takes longer than you to get ready is strike one against him, but the fact that he matches his socks to his underwear and to his ascot drives him out of the park. 5. The OverEater: It's an irritating fact that men can eat more than women. The overeater doesn't care. Food is his first love and he'll push cannolis and baked ziti on you like a crazed Italian granny. Unless you don't mind a future spent in stretch-pants, you might want to give this dude a pass. 6. The OverReactor: Remember when Russell Crowe threw a phone at that hotel clerk who somehow displeased him? That's this guy. From the old lady who accidentally bumped into him at the grocery store, to the SUV that cut him off on the highway -- everyone in his path will hear his wrath. You, most of all. Do not walk away -- run. 7. The Over-The-Topper: He's the life of the party and thinks nothing of driving his motorcycle through the bar if he thinks it'll get a laugh. He's certainly cute, but he just never stops. He's always on. And that, will quickly turn into a turn-off. 8. OverAchiever: Picture the male version of Tracy Flick in the movie \"Election\" in perfectly fitted jeans, a crisp white oxford shirt and a copy of his (perfect, naturally) SAT scores in his wallet. Now imagine making love to him. You can't, can you? 9. The OverCompensator: Maybe he was the homeliest kid in his eighth-grade class, but that doesn't mean you need to sit through a monologue about how much money he makes, how jealous his friends are over his new BMW, and how he totally could date supermodels if he wanted to.

The declarations come in the wake of increased tension between Russia and the United States over Russia's invasion last month of the former Soviet republic of Georgia, a U.S. ally that aspires to join NATO. Russian ships will make a port of call in Venezuela later this year and the two nations could hold joint naval exercises for the first time, both sides said. Russia denied there was any link between Monday's announcement and the conflict in the Caucasus, although Russia has criticized U.S. support for Georgia, and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has long antagonized Washington. \"This is a planned event unrelated to the current political situation and Caucasian developments,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko said Monday. \"The exercises will not be targeted against any third party.\" The agreement on the Russian visit to Venezuelan ports was reached long before the conflict in the Caucasus broke out, he said. But he appeared to suggest Monday that Russia had proposed the joint naval maneuvers. \"If the Venezuelan side finds the proposal interesting and an agreement is reached, Russia and Venezuela may hold joint naval exercises in line with international practice,\" he said. Several hours later, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Washington is canceling the proposed \"123 Agreement\" with Moscow, which would have cleared the way for more trade of nuclear technology, services and goods between the two countries. He denied the pullout was directly linked to Moscow's actions in the Caucasus. \"Over a period of time, we've had some deep concerns about Russian behavior. And quite clearly the president has taken this action looking at the facts,\" he said. Both countries had accepted the agreement and it was awaiting congressional approval. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned in an exclusive interview with CNN last week that Russia would not be pleased at the collapse of the 123 Agreement, which is named after a section of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954. \"This would effectively kill any possibility for our cooperation to promote the Bush-Putin initiative on nuclear nonproliferation -- which is important for the entire world,\" he said. \"As I said, it wouldn't be our choice, but if the United States does not want to cooperate with us on one or another issue, we cannot impose ourselves on Washington.\" But experts say Congress was unlikely to have given the deal a green light, and that the White House was making the best of a bad situation. \"I think [the administration is] making a virtue out of a necessity\" by pulling out, said Russia analyst Jon Wolfsthal of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, last week. On the possibility of Russian-Venezuelan naval exercises, Latin America expert Wayne S. Smith warned against reading too much into the proposal. \"The Russians have complained about U.S. warships operating in the Black Sea, which is an area of intense interest to them. It would not be surprising if they returned the favor by having joint exercises in the Caribbean,\" said Smith, a 25-year foreign service veteran who ended his State Department career as chief of the U.S. Interest Section in Havana. \"It's a way of saying: 'Two can play at this game. If you think you can send ships into the Black Sea without response, you are mistaken.' \" But he said the mere fact of Russian ships operating in the Western hemisphere would not necessarily be dangerous. \"The act itself is not. Having naval exercises? Fine, as long as both sides take it for what it is. It's not a threatening gesture, it's a message.\" Frank Mora, a Latin America expert at the National Defense University in Washington, said the announcement could be part of a complicated bargaining process, depending on whether relations improve between Moscow and Washington. \"Something tells me that soon enough something will happen to tone this down, and possibly this exercise with the Venezuelans could be used to pull back on this issue,\" Mora said. \"If things improve [the Russians] could pull back as a sign of commitment to improving the relationship. If tensions remain I see the possibility that this kind of exercise would occur.\" He said the Venezuelans have little to contribute to a military alliance with Russia. \"They have a couple of destroyers, a couple of old submarines, and frigates that can launch surface-to-air missiles -- not anything sophisticated or robust. This would not be a robust exercise. It would be more about indicating strategic cooperation.\" But he suggested that if the exercise does go ahead, it would be a sign of increased Russian confidence vis-a-vis the United States. \"They feel they are strong enough and bold enough to do something in our sphere of influence,\" he said. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman appeared to shrug off the announcement. \"We exercise all around the globe and have joint exercises with countries all over the world; so do many other nations,\" he said. Chavez said Sunday that Caracas was prepared to receive the Russians in late November or December, according Venezuela's ministry of communications. But he indicated Venezuela might not be prepared for military exercises by then. \"We're only in the planning phase. We're not ready yet for the visit and the probable maneuvers to happen in September or October, or even November. So it could happen, if not at the end of November, then at the beginning of December,\" he said. Nesterenko said the Russian flotilla will include \"the heavy nuclear-propelled missile cruiser Pyotr Veliki and the large anti-submarine ship Admiral Chabanenko.\" The announcement comes only days after a U.S. Navy command ship, the USS Whitney, arrived in the Georgian port town of Poti in what the United States called a humanitarian mission. The ship reached Poti on Friday. Russia said the fact that a military vessel is being used in a relief mission raises concerns. Russia has become a major supplier of arms to Venezuela since 2001. The two countries signed a series of deals worth $3 billion in 2006, including fighter aircraft, transport and attack helicopters, and assault rifles, according to Jane's, the defense intelligence publication. Chavez visited Moscow in July for his first meeting with new Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko and Matthew Chance in Moscow and CNN State Department producer Charley Keyes in Washington contributed to this report.", "00ae31ff5ede1de6cd39eccf36bae935c882527b": "BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The head of China's quality watchdog is reported to have resigned over the tainted baby milk scandal that has killed four children and sickened nearly 53,000 others. The official Xinhua News Agency said Li Changjiang had quit with the approval of China's State Council. Li's agency is responsible for ensuring that China's food supply chain is safe. Monday's resignation came hours after the World Health Organization said the scandal had highlighted flaws in the country's entire food supply chain. The chemical melamine blamed for causing kidney stones and kidney failure has been detected in formula milk powder from 22 dairies across China. The crisis was initially thought to have been confined to baby milk powder, but tests have found melamine in samples of liquid milk taken from China's two largest dairy producers, Mengniu Dairy Group and Yili Industrial Group, as well as Shanghai-based Bright Dairy. WHO China representative Hans Troedsson said on Monday quality issues could occur anywhere from the farm to the retail outlet. He said \"it's clearly something that is not acceptable and needs to be rectified and corrected,\" according to The Associated Press. Troedsson said the WHO was discussing with officials how to strengthen China's food quality system. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has called milk manufacturers \"heartless\" and promised stricter laws to protect the public. China's Health Ministry said Sunday that about 13,000 children were hospitalized, while another 40,000 had undergone outpatient treatment for illnesses related to suspected melamine-tainted milk products. The scandal has spread beyond the mainland with melamine being found in three Chinese-made dairy products in Singapore. The country's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority said tests on \"White Rabbit Creamy Candy\" showed that it was contaminated with melamine and it ordered stores to remove the product from shelves. Taiwan announced Monday it was banning the importation of all dairy products from China because of melamine contamination in milk supplies on the mainland, Taiwan's Health Ministry said Monday. And a second child in Hong Kong has been diagnosed with a kidney stones after drinking the tainted milk as worried parents continued to take their children for health checkups, the government said Monday, AP reported. The 4-year-old boy was in hospital in a stable condition, the Hong Kong government said in a statement. A three-year-old girl was sickened by a suspected melamine-tainted milk over the weekend -- the first known illness outside of mainland China. The Chinese premier visited Beijing hospitals and a supermarket Sunday to show his concern for the crisis. \"What we need to do now is to ensure that nothing like this happens in the future, not only in dairy products, but in all foods,\" he said. \"Manufacturers and owners of dairy companies should show more morality and social responsibility in these cases. They are heartless, so we have to create strict law and legislation. I'm sorry.\" Investigators arrested two brothers who sold milk used to produce the contaminated baby milk powder last week. They could face death if convicted, according to China Daily, a state-run newspaper. The raw milk had been watered down and the chemical added to fool quality checks, the newspaper said. Melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants.  Watch CNN visit the company at the center of the scandal \u00bb . But anger has been directed not just at the producers accused of adulterating their milk to increase profits, but also at government regulators, Time magazine reported. \"Xinhua was quick to blame the dairy industry for their skewed rules, but what it didn't say was that the government also played a part in that ugly game,\" the magazine quoted a blogger, identified as sadmoon109, as saying. Health experts say ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones, urinary tract ulcers, and eye and skin irritation. It also robs infants of much-needed nutrition. Thousands of tons of the tainted milk powder have been recalled. Melamine is the same industrial contaminant from China that poisoned and killed thousands of U.S. dogs and cats last year. The chemical, a byproduct of plastic manufacturing, can be used to mimic high-protein additives.  Learn more about the chemical melamine \u00bb . A senior dairy analyst said Chinese farmers were cutting corners to cope with rising costs for feed and labor. \"Before the melamine incident, I know they could have been adding organic stuff, say animal urine or skin,\" Chen Lianfang of Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultant told Time. \"Basically, anything that can boost the protein reading.\" Copyright 2008 CNN.

Pamela Stephenson first met Billy Connolly on the set of a comedy show in 1979. They married in Fiji in 1990. It may not have been love at first sight on the set of British comedy show \"Not the Nine O'Clock News,\" but love, marriage and children eventually followed. Australian comedienne, now psychotherapist, Pamela Stephenson, describes being captivated by Billy Connolly's wildman looks, his mane of grey hair and devil-may-care demeanor. She tells CNN's Revealed about her first impressions of her husband, his unique ability to keep audiences entertained and what she learnt about his addictions and childhood abuse while writing his best-selling biography, \"Billy.\" CNN: Take us back to the beginning. How did you meet Billy Connolly? Pamela Stephenson: I'm not quite sure what Billy's version of how we met is like because he was very drunk. I met him when I was a performer on \"Not The Nine O'Clock News\" and he was a guest. He was just shaggy and some kind of terrible beastie. But I was attracted to him immediately, maybe because he was so unusual. I think what I picked up on was his dichotomy -- that beastiness and the underlying sensitivity that he has. I think that's something that audiences relate to, you're aware of all the toughness, but underneath you just know that there's philosophy and this poetic, Celtic nature that speaks to people. Also his pain, his underlying sadness and the pain of his childhood ... when I first met him I think I connected with that. He played the Ayatollah Khomeini in a scene on \"Not The Nine O'Clock News\" and I played a demented fan singing a love song to him, it was in days when you could do stuff like that, I suppose. And then we did an interview, I pretending to be British TV personality Janet Street-Porter, with giant fake teeth which kept falling out. Of course, he could never keep a straight face; I thought he was dreadfully unprofessional because he just kept laughing, especially when my teeth fell out -- my fake teeth --  fell out. CNN: What's it like being married to him? PS: People always think that being married to Billy means that I get non-stop Billy Connolly concerts. It's not nearly as exciting as that, although he's adorable. But it's boring sometimes and he would say the same. There are moments when I wish he would go and make me a cup of tea, which he does very often. Actually, Billy is quite a quiet person. He's a little reclusive and I don't think it's necessarily his personality. With the highs he experiences on stage he needs to be very quiet when he's not.  Billy Connolly takes CNN's Revealed on a tour of his home \u00bb . CNN: What made you write a biography of his life? Was it the first time he opened up about his childhood? PS: When I wrote \"Billy,\" it was the first time that Billy really looked at his childhood in a chronological order and with depth. It was a painful process, but cathartic. The book gave me the opportunity to understand a lot more about him. Just putting some of this together, the sexual abuse, for example, that he received from his father, the physical abuse he received from his aunts, helped me understand why there's a part of him that's very closed off.  Watch Billy recall his troubled childhood \u00bb . His learning disability was never understood. Now we'd call it an attention disorder. In those days, he had difficulty concentrating, for which he was beaten and taunted at school. People told him he was stupid and to this day there's a part of him that thinks that's he's not as clever as other people and yet he is absolutely brilliant. He's incredibly well-read and very erudite. CNN: Can you tell us about Billy's problems with alcohol and drugs and how you helped him? PS: Billy was extremely famous in Scotland, and you know what happens, especially with people who don't think they are very worthy. As with Billy, they don't handle fame because they don't feel they deserve it and they'll turn to alcohol and drugs. It became very serious and by the time I met him he was on a very self-destructive path. At first, that was appealing to me, but later I realized I can't be with somebody like that because I don't want to watch him destroy himself. I didn't tell him, \"You've gotta clean up your act,\" I just said I can't deal with this. I discovered you can't make anyone stop drinking or stop taking drugs, you have to just protect yourself and if they want to jump on the good train, they will. Fortunately it worked. CNN: How would you describe Billy's style of comedy? PS: Billy doesn't have a style, because to have a style it would mean that there have to be other people with a similar way of working. He goes on stage and it's like he's got these comedy angels whispering in his ear. He makes this extraordinary connection with the audience, and of course he's very astute and funny about politics. He sees the funny side of all kinds of things -- human nature, human behavior, world events, politicians. He'll talk about that with such passion. It's what many of us think but don't want to say. Billy will see something on television or notice something on the street or he'll just think something and it'll go into his computer of a brain and it'll stumble out when he's on stage.  See Billy Connolly perform on a recent tour of Ireland \u00bb . CNN: Is he the same person on and off stage? PS: He's honest and real. He's a man of the people, a working class hero. It's a clich\u00e9, but people know that he has struggled; they know he's come from the tough part of Glasgow. Billy just loves an audience, he loves speaking to people if they're nice to him, and they usually are. When he's finished his show, he doesn't go home. He stays in his dressing room and people will come and see him and he'll talk to them for another hour. CNN: He says he's getting more and more nervous when he goes on stage -- have you noticed a change? PS: I don't think he's getting more nervous. At his age, maybe he thinks that it should have become easier -- well, it's not going to become easier. It's incredibly tough to go on stage in front of four or five thousand people and sustain [their interest] by yourself. And one thing that really impresses me, again as a psychologist, is that I think he is really healing. I think that people really have the opportunity to just laugh like that and it's so good for you. I feel fantastic when I go to one of his shows and come out and I'm just sick with laughter. CNN: How does he feel when he comes off stage? He says it can be tough and envies the audience. They can go home and forget about it. PS: Most performers struggle with the letdown after a show, and Billy's no exception. It's tough because it takes time for adrenalin to leave the system. That's actually one reason why a lot of comedians turn to alcohol, because it's a depressant and takes you down. Now that Billy doesn't drink he's found another way -- he goes back to his hotel and stays quiet. Sometimes he likes to eat after the show but not very often. He will just want to veg out, watch TV. Playing his banjo is a great way for him to relax.  Watch a rare performance of Billy on banjo \u00bb . He doesn't like me being around when he's touring because he just likes to do his thing. I want to have some food or go and do something. He becomes a bit of a hermit, and that's appropriate for someone who expends that amount of energy and brainpower on stage. CNN: Billy says he finds the routine of touring increasingly tough -- do you think he will stop soon? PS: When Billy's touring, he'll say, \"Oh I don't want to tour anymore, I've had enough it's too hard on the road.\" But the truth is, when he's not touring, he wants to go back. It's probably his happiest time. I have been a comedian so I know a little bit about what it's like to be on stage and know that when things are working fantastically, and you're getting that appreciation from the audience. It is an incredible high. It's pretty hard for me as a wife or us as a family or any of his fans or friends to match up to that kind of adulation and so, you know, he deserves it and I have to remind him that it is a lot of fun for him. CNN: How would you describe his dress sense? PS: Billy is a fashion maven. He spends most of his time in New York now so, you know, the New York \"Black is the new black\" is ... that's got to him a bit. He's influenced by Rock 'n' Roll and Vivienne Westwood and edgy stuff. But he just puts it together in his own unique way. He also takes great pride in his body. His closet is still extremely fun. It's far more colorful than mine. I have grey and black suits and things for work -- he loves colorful shirts. It will be a shame if he tones himself down, but I don't think that will happen. He borrows my clothes sometimes, if he sees something particularly mad. We used to say, \"First up, best dressed,\" which is the Glasgow expression for a particularly fun brooch or hat.", "5d2bd08df8b8cc9c62bc438c060479dbebd1057c": "(CNN) -- A diamond unearthed in the southern African nation of Lesotho could yield one of the largest and highest quality round polished diamonds, according to a statement Monday from company that found it. A mining company unearthed this 478-carat diamond in the southern African nation of Lesotho. Experts in Antwerp, Belgium who analyzed the 478-carat stone determined it to be of the highest color grading available for a white diamond, said a statement from Gem Diamonds Ltd., the company that found the stone. \"What makes it more remarkable is the color and quality of this stone,\" said diamond consultant Neil Buxton. \"It's a D color, which is the highest possible graded color you can get, and we believe there is a chance -- a very good chance -- of getting a 100-carat plus\" round stone with the highest color and clarity rankings. The company said such a stone would \"to the best of our knowledge\" be \"the first one in history.\"  Watch more on the diamond \u00bb . The diamond, which was found in September, ranks as the 20th largest rough diamond ever found, but is not the biggest ever taken from the Letseng Mine, which is co-owned by Gem Diamonds Ltd. and the Kingdom of Lesotho, a country of 2.1 million that is surrounded by South Africa. Two bigger stones -- 603 and 493 carats -- were found in the mine in 2006 and 2007, respectively, the company said. A 601-carat diamond was mined there in 1960, it said.", "a9e946a8ee4153ae7e45143941da7f61fd04321a": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Formula One is about putting on a 90-minute show every other weekend at locations the world over. McLaren's huge 'brand center' motorhome dominates the F1 paddock at all European grands prix. But getting that show on the road -- and in the air and on the sea -- is a remarkable feat of well-oiled logistics and organization. With an F1 team clocking up around 100,000 miles (160,000 km) between tests and grands prix, the need to have moving and packing down to a fine art is imperative. \"Once the calendar is released, we sit down with all the different departments,\" explained Toyota team manager Richard Cregan. \"We look at the dates for the freight, the dates for the trucks leaving, when we want to have the people there and when we want to have all the equipment there. Then we go away and arrange it.\" As F1 moves further away from its European heartland, more races -- such as next week's title shootout in Sao Paulo, Brazil -- are what are known as 'flyaways.' They are the responsibility of Formula One Management. Freight company DHL has specialized units in England and Italy to coordinate the transport of cars, equipment and fuel to all F1 tracks around the world by air, sea and land. Around 300 tonnes or 20,000 individual items of F1 material -- from race cars, replacement parts, pit equipment, TV equipment and the furnishings of the VIP Paddock Club -- are moved for each grand prix. Each team is allowed 22-24 tonnes of freight, plus their cars, which is packed in specially designed pods at a UK-based team's HQ and transferred to Stansted airport by road. Three chartered Boeing 747 freighters then fly to the destination and the next time the team sees its freight is at their allocated garage at the circuit. At the end of the race the process starts again in reverse, with a team packed up by around 10pm. Read more about F1 at The Circuit. If there are two weeks between races, as is the norm, the cars will return to the UK to be painted, re-built and polished. 'Double-headers,' races that take place only a week apart, rule this movement out -- then getting the cars from one circuit to the next is the sole focus. While last-minute deliveries can be made in under 24 hours, it takes seven weeks for equipment to travel by sea from Europe to Melbourne, Australia for the traditional season curtain-raiser. Cheaper sea freight has become more popular to move bulkier items such as heavy electrical cables. Bridgestone, the grid's tire supplier, are among those who have increased their shipping in recent years. \"We send about five-and-a-half tonnes by sea and we send this three months in advance of each race,\" said Williams race team coordinator Paul Singlehurst. \"It costs around $9,000 to send it by sea -- that's a fraction of the air freight cost. We've made some huge savings by doing this.\" The European races are a little more straightforward. Up to four $2m team-liveried articulated lorries are driven to continental grands prix, carrying up to 37 tonnes of equipment each for around 18,600 miles (30,000km) per year. Three trucks will also go to a two-car test session. They carry all the kit the team needs for the weekend, including the cars, engines, parts, tools, computers and radios. It takes two days to fully load the trucks after cleaning and maintenance checks, using an 80-page checklist. Nothing is left to chance. They leave a week before the next race, get to the circuit late on a Monday and by Thursday, the team's working area is ready for the drivers. It takes eight hours just to fit out the team's pit area at the circuit. Motorhomes, the standard of which is set by McLaren's gargantuan 'brand center', also travel to European races. They provide a place for drivers to debrief with their engineers, team members to refuel and corporate guests to be entertained. Renault's race team includes 15 engineers, 35 mechanics/technicians, 15 'truckies', 11 motorhome/catering personnel, two logistics personnel, 10 marketing and PR staff, three drivers, two managers and two physios. This is why motorhomes supply around 1,250 meals for the team and its guests during a race weekend. \"Obviously our sponsors' backing is crucial. It's not just a matter of having their name and logo on the car -- we have a marketing team that helps to service their needs,\" added Singlehurst. Occasionally, at places like Turkey, where the traffic between the circuit and downtown Istanbul is horrific, drivers can also spend their nights in the motorhomes. But normally, a fleet of about 20 vehicles is required to ferry team personnel between their hotel -- block-booked months in advance -- and racetrack all weekend. As far as Cregan is concerned, how a team performs during a race weekend can be influenced by its logistical set-up. \"Quite often you have very long days, you have people working late into the evening and it's an important part of our responsibility to create the atmosphere for people to be able do their job,\" he added. It takes a Herculean effort and millions of dollars to make sure 20 cars circulate for 90 minutes every two weeks. But you would never know it.", "036e874958640111b8f46d096c7e58ba51b46187": "(CNN) -- People along the Texas coast were leaving home or planning to evacuate Thursday as Hurricane Ike churned toward them, slowly intensifying on its march west. Forecasters say the storm could slam into the Texas coast -- south of Galveston -- as a powerful Category 3 storm late Friday or early Saturday. Mandatory and voluntary evacuations were planned or underway in at least seven coastal counties. Aransas County, on the eastern coast of Texas, has ordered a mandatory evacuation of all nonessential government employees, becoming the latest county in the state to urge residents to flee. In Galveston, city officials ordered mandatory evacuations for part of the island town beginning at 7 a.m. Thursday. The rest of the town will be under a voluntary evacuation order. Only residents will be required to evacuate on the western end of the island. Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas defended that, saying current models call for Galveston to be hit with winds and rain only equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane. \"We do not intend to evacuate Galveston Island,\" she said. \"It's the last thing we want to do. Our job is to protect lives and property, [and] right now we feel that sheltering in place is the best action for our citizens to take.\" Farther up the Gulf Coast and closer to where the National Hurricane Center predicts a direct hit, Brazoria County ordered a mandatory evacuation to begin at 8 a.m. Thursday. Some other Texas localities have ordered mandatory evacuations, while others have left the decision to depart up to residents. As of 5 a.m. ET Thursday, the Category 2 storm -- with top sustained winds near 100 mph -- was about  620 miles east of Brownsville, Texas, and about 285 miles southeast of the Mississippi River, the hurricane center said. Track the storm \u00bb . Hurricane-force winds extended out up to 115 miles from the storm's center, and tropical storm-force winds extended out up to 255 miles forecasters reported. About 15,000 residents were leaving Galveston's Brazoria County Wednesday after a mandatory evacuation order was issued at 10 a.m. CT (11 a.m. ET) governing one ZIP code -- 77541 -- and residents throughout the county with special needs. Galveston City Manager Steve LeBlanc issued a warning to residents of the city's West End, citing forecasters' estimates that the area could get tides of 6 feet above normal if the storm arrives there. The West End is the area of Galveston most susceptible to flooding, LeBlanc said. Other Brazoria residents were being allowed to remain as of 6 p.m. ET. In Matagorda County, southwest of Galveston, officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for all areas except the cities of Bay City and Van Vleck. The evacuation must be completed by at 6 p.m. (7 p.m. ET) Thursday. Galveston is likely to experience a high tidal surge, officials said, urging people living in low-lying areas or mobile homes to get out soon. \"One of the things that the public has to understand if they decide to stay, there will be a period of time during this storm when they will absolutely be on their own,\" Brazoria County Sheriff Charles Wagner said. \"There will be no medical services; there will be no fire department; there will be no law enforcement, groceries, gasoline, drugs, electricity.\" The center issued a tropical storm warning from the Mississippi River's mouth to Cameron, Louisiana, and a hurricane watch from Cameron to Port Mansfield, Texas, about 60 miles south of Brownsville. Tropical storm warnings mean winds of 39 to 73 mph (63 to 118 kmh) are expected within a day, and a hurricane watch means winds of 74 and higher are expected within 36 hours. \"Hurricane Ike is now in the Gulf of Mexico and making its approach toward our coast,\" Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement. \"The next few days will be crucial for residents to follow the direction of local leaders and to take the necessary steps to protect themselves and their families.\" Perry put 7,500 National Guard members on standby this week, his office said, and issued a disaster declaration for 88 counties. About 1,350 buses, several ambulances and paramedic buses were available to support evacuations. The vehicles were positioned near Houston, Matagorda County, Nueces County and Victoria County, the governor's office said. President Bush declared an emergency in the state, making federal funds available for the state to prepare for the storm. Corpus Christi officials also began the evacuation process for residents with special needs, supplying buses to transport them out of town. Voluntary evacuations were issued in San Patricio and Victoria counties and parts of Jackson County, according to the governor's office. More than 1,300 inmates from the Texas Correctional Institutions Division's Stevenson Unit in Cuero were being evacuated to facilities in Beeville and Kenedy, Perry's office said, and 597 were transferred from the substance abuse Glossbrenner Unit in San Diego, in south Texas, to Dilley. Naval air stations in Texas also began to prepare for Hurricane Ike's expected arrival. Naval Air Station Kingsville was to begin moving about 50 aircraft to El Paso, San Antonio and Fort Worth on Wednesday afternoon, the public affairs office there said. Naval Air Station Corpus Christi will also move about 75 aircraft to other Texas locations, its public affairs office said. Evacuations appeared to have saved lives in Cuba when Ike slammed into the island. Four deaths were reported from the storm, according to the Cuban government. The Cuban Civil Defense brought buses or trucks to take people to shelters.  See the damage from the storm \u00bb . Cuban state television reported that two people were killed when they tried to remove an antenna, The Associated Press said. One man died when a tree crashed into his home, and a woman died when her home's roof collapsed, according to the AP. The storm shredded hundreds of homes and caused some dilapidated buildings in Havana's older areas to collapse, the AP reported.  Watch as winds and waves pound Cuba \u00bb . The United States, which provided $100,000 in emergency aid to communist-run Cuba through private aid agencies after Hurricane Gustav hit the island August 30, said Tuesday that it was considering additional emergency aid for Cuba because of Ike. Also, the United States said it will lift restrictions on cash and humanitarian assistance sent to Cuba for the next 90 days. The move will allow nongovernmental organizations to provide assistance and cash donations.

They think they're so great with all their fancy book learning. What they don't realize is that TV isn't for dummies -- there's tons of educational programming available -- you just need to know what to watch. I mean, you can learn your ABCs with \"Sesame Street's\" Grover, how to make gnocchi with Mario Batali, and the ins and outs of prettying up your home with any number of programs on HGTV. Television is also a great romance resource. Think of all the great TV twosomes we've seen over the years -- Lucy & Ricky Ricardo, Judy & George Jetson, Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag ... but not all TV personalities set such a sincerely loving example.

Actor David Duchovny, playing what the tabloids would have you believe is an autobiographical role, has managed to hang onto his Bukowski-phase well into his forties. Drinking, partying, and resisting monogamy, Hank still manages to attract more ladies than hotter men half his age. Of course the only women drawn to Hank are either damaged girls with daddy issues or the type of dame who doesn't feel complete unless she has some mess to clean up after. If you see yourself dating a Hank Moody type, do not walk -- run -- to your nearest mental health professional. Vince Chase (\"Entourage\"): Those big blue eyes and that floppy mop o' hair...  you can forgive him for making a stinker like \"Medellin,\" can't you? Sure, but do you really want to deal with someone who lives in a dude cocoon? Not only does he live with his brother and two best friends, he can't make any decisions without polling the group. On the upside, he's rich! On the downside, he's famous, which means other women are throwing themselves at him constantly. Vince might be fun for a fling, but forget about bringing him home to mama. Don Draper (\"Mad Men\"): Why is it when unattractive people are quiet we just assume they're stupid and/or boring, but verbally challenged hot people get pegged as mysterious and smoldering? Mad Men's smokin' hot Don Draper actually is mysterious (and smoldering!), so I don't know what point I was trying to make (because I'm all distracted from the photos on his IMDB page)... oh, wait! The point I'm trying to make is that while Draper is indeed mysterious, he's also a liar, a cheat and a cad. So if a DDT tries to slip you his number, just say no and send it to me. What?

Younger brother Amar breaks rocks in a mine for a living. Kundan farms their small piece of inherited land. They live in a beautiful but remote hillside village in the clouds of Himachal Pradesh, India. Kundar Singh Pundir, left, and his brother Amar, right, share Indira Devi, centre, as their wife. Both aged in their forties, the two brothers have lived together nearly their whole lives. They are poor and share just about everything: Their home, their work and a wife. \"See we have a tradition from the beginning to have a family of five to 10 people. Two brothers and one wife.\" Kundan says. They practice what is known as fraternal polyandry -- where the brothers of one family marry the same woman. Why? Tradition and economics. Life is hard here. The village is precariously perched on the side of a very steep hill about 6,000ft up. Most of the villagers survive off tiny plots of cropland. In this difficult terrain there isn't enough land to go around. So, instead of finding separate wives and splitting up their inherited property, the brothers marry the same woman and keep their land together. Wife Indira Devi says life with two husbands isn't easy. \"We fight a lot.\" But like any married couple they fight mostly over mundane stuff, except there are three spouses instead of two. \"Usually it's about chores, why didn't you do this? Why didn't you do that?\" she says.  Watch Sara Sidner's interview with the brothers \u00bb . One thing they agreed on was the need to have children; They have three. So how does a married trio deal with sex? \"We make shifts, change shifts and sleep on alternate days. We have to make shifts otherwise it won't work,\" Kundan says. \"To run our families we have to do this, overcome the hurdles as well and then we have to control our hearts from feeling too much,\" Amar adds. To outsiders their arrangement may seem odd, but in the village of about 200 it is the norm. Typically the marriages are arranged and women have two husbands. But some wives have three or four depending on how many brothers there are in a family. Polyandry is illegal in India but socially acceptable here. No one from the government seems to bother the villagers about the law. \"It's been going on for ages. My sister in law has two husbands, my mother in law also has two husbands,\" Indira says. And as to the question of which husband is the biological father of the children -- the Pundir's don't know and don't care. \"For me everyone is the same, my mother and my fathers are the same. My mother and my fathers are like God to me,\" 17-year old daughter Sunita Singh Pundir says. Even as modern society arrives in this ancient village through satellite dishes and mobile phones, the Pundirs say they want their age-old tradition to continue with their children. \"Absolutely,\" eldest son Sohna says. He and his younger brother have already discussed it and will marry the same woman. Daughter Sunita isn't so sure. \"I would like one husband,\" she says. But when asked if she will marry for love or tradition, Sunita's answer makes it clear the tradition of marrying more than one man will continue with the next generation. \"I will never leave our tradition even if I have to forgo love. I will never spoil my parents' reputation and my brothers.'\"", "7bf066e9fa3c6b5aaeaf0c0867aefc55c029fb9d": "MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Barack Obama sometimes gets ribbed for his outsized ideas, like the massive stage built in Denver, Colorado, to accept the Democratic presidential nomination. But an artist in Barcelona, Spain, may be about to outdo the candidate himself. Large-format sketches have long been a focus of artist Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada's work. The artist plans to create a gigantic face of Obama sculpted from gravel and sand, which will cover nearly 2.5 acres (1 hectare) of Barcelona beachfront before the U.S. elections. \"The size of the piece is intrinsic to its value,\" the artist, Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada, said Saturday. He hopes it will be big enough to be seen on Google Earth. \"Obama's personality -- his youth, personal history and message of a new politics -- has fused with the historical moment to create someone larger than life,\" says the artist's dossier about the work, titled \"Expectation.\" The huge size also alludes \"to the global impact of this election,\" the dossier adds. iReport.com: What do you want to ask Sen. Obama? Rodriguez-Gerada, 42, is a Cuban-born American who grew up in North Plainfield, New Jersey, near New York, and now lives in Barcelona. The artist, who has long focused on large-format sketches and other designs, said he had been planning to put an anonymous face on Barcelona's Mediterranean beachfront but shelved the idea. Then, six weeks ago, he decided it should be Obama's face. \"Everybody's doing work about Obama,\" he said. \"I was talking to my wife about the importance of this election internationally. It all came together.\" The idea, that is. The execution of the project is still a work in progress, but with a lot of help pouring in. The artist has created what he calls a \"vectored image\" from different photos of Obama, showing the candidate's face looking left over his shoulder. He will use 500 tons of material -- mainly gravel but also sand and possibly some soil in black, brown and white tones -- to create the image on a flat piece of land slightly raised and overlooking the Mediterranean, near downtown Barcelona. The artist and a Barcelona newspaper say the city has temporarily ceded use of the land for the project. The portrait of Obama's face will be 445 feet long by 264 feet wide (139.28 by 82.67 meters) and the artist hopes to have it done by late next week or no later than November 3, the day before the U.S. elections. The materials have been donated, along with bulldozers and their drivers. The crews will initially spread the materials along white lines, and other markers that will be laid out according to the sketch. Then, the artist's technical team will direct volunteers with garden rakes to put the final touches on the materials, making sure the various colors are spread properly on the ground in order to depict Obama's eyes, hair, cheeks and collar, according to the plans. Rodriguez-Gerada said he'll need to raise about $18,700 (15,000 euros) for other costs, such as rakes and gloves for volunteers, documentation, even portable toilets for the crew. He said it's his \"biggest work ever, in scale and complexity.\" He's a self-described political independent until recently, when he joined Democrats Abroad in Spain. But he added that the art project is his alone, without help from any political organization or campaign, and he won't be paid for it. Rodriguez-Gerada said this project also aims to address the issue of \"trying to find heroes with empathy for the problems of the world. We really need empathy from Barack Obama. There's a need to do positive things for the future.\" Obama's giant face would be environmentally friendly, with all natural colors, so the materials could be recycled, the artist said. Rodriguez-Gerada's not sure how long the face would remain in place in Barcelona, because the site is slated to be used for a new municipal building. But even if the face isn't permanent, it might be the start of outsized artistic images of Obama.

More than 50 people died in last month's attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad. The men appeared Friday before a magistrate in an anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi, police and Pakistan Federal Investigation Agency investigators said. Although they have not been charged, the magistrate is allowing police to hold them for a week while the investigation continues. The magistrate ordered them back to court on October 31. Authorities have not said how they believe these men are connected to the September 20 bombing. The men -- one of whom is a doctor -- were arrested at different times in different places, authorities said, but gave no additional details. They identified them as: Dr. Muhammad Usman and Tehseen Ulla Jaan, both from Peshawar; Ilyas Rana Muhammad, from a village near Faiselabad in Pakistan's Punjab province; and Hameed Afzal Muhammad, from Toba Taik Singh district, also in Punjab province. In addition to the dozens killed, some 250 people were wounded in the suicide truck attack, which sparked a fire that left the hotel in ruins.

Pakistan says it shot at two U.S. OH-58D helicopters like this one pictured in a U.S. Army photo. The U.S. Army OH-58D Kiowas, part of NATO's International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan, were patrolling the Pakistani-Afghan border when the Pakistani military fired on them, NATO and U.S. officials said. The Pakistani military said the fire was warning shots, and President Asif Ali Zardari said it was flares. Both Zardari and the Pakistani military said the helicopters had crossed into Pakistani territory -- a charge U.S. officials denied. Rear Adm. Greg Smith of U.S. Central Command said the helicopters were providing cover for a small U.S. military unit accompanying an Afghan border police unit on a routine patrol. After the shots were fired at the helicopters, Smith told CNN, the U.S. troops fired \"suppressing rounds\" into a nearby hill to get the Pakistanis to stop. That prompted the Pakistani troops to stop firing at the helicopters and fire instead in the direction of the troops, he said. The U.S. troops then returned fire, Smith said. No injuries were reported in the five-minute incident. Smith and other U.S. officials said the helicopter crews did not fire back. But the Pakistanis disagreed, asserting in a written statement that the helicopters \"returned fire\" after the initial shots were fired. \"The helicopters passed over our border post and were well within Pakistan territory\" at the time that \"security forces fired anticipatory warning shots,\" the Pakistani statement said. After the shots were fired, \"the helicopters returned fire and flew back.\" The Pakistani statement did not mention exchanging fire with ground troops and did not identify the shots as flares, as Zardari did in New York in an appearance with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. \"They are flares,\" he said in response to a question asking why the Pakistani military was firing on NATO helicopters. \"Just to make sure that they know they crossed the border line.\" Asked if such warnings will continue, he replied, \"Sometimes the border is so mixed that they don't realize that they crossed the border.\" Rice, off camera, agreed that \"the border is very unclear\" and \"inhospitable.\" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman reiterated the United States' stance that the two helicopters were over Afghan territory. \"The Pakistanis need to provide the U.S. a reason to why this took place,\" he said. The ISAF issued a news release saying that \"ISAF helicopters received small-arms fire from a Pakistan military checkpoint along the border near Tanai district, Khowst.\" \"At no time did ISAF helicopters cross into Pakistani airspace.\" The ISAF did not mention ground troops or say whether the helicopters returned fire. Both the ISAF and Pakistani military said they are working to resolve the issue. Last week, Zardari said Pakistan would not allow foreign nations to violate its sovereignty to pursue terrorists. \"We will not tolerate the violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity by any power in the name of combating terrorism,\" he said in his first speech to Parliament as president. His remark followed a similar declaration from Pakistan's military chief, Gen. Parvez Kayani, who said this month that Pakistan's territorial integrity \"will be defended at all cost, and no external force is allowed to conduct operations.\" A senior defense official in the Pentagon said the Pentagon is trying to determine the details of Thursday's incident. \"What we don't know if this was just a case of trigger-happy members of the Frontier Corps,\" the official said, \"or whether in fact the Pakistani military does have orders to fire on our helicopters.\" \"We are confident our helicopters were on the Afghan side of the border, and we have no report they fired back,\" the official added. Top U.S. commanders will be talking to the Pakistani military about the incident to determine if there was a misunderstanding and to ensure it doesn't happen again, a U.S. official familiar with details of the incident said. The official said this is the first verified incident of U.S. troops being fired upon by Pakistani forces. There were at least two previous reports in recent days out of Pakistan about similar incidents, but the United States has said neither of those reports was true.

Boone Pickens spoke about the beleaguered U.S. economy, a prospective bailout and natural gas Thursday, a day after reports that his energy-related hedge funds lost $1 billion this year. Billionaire T. Boone Pickens has reportedly lost about $270 million this year. Speaking to CNN's John Roberts, Pickens said he concurred with President Bush's Wednesday assessment that a \"distressing scenario would unfold\" in the U.S. economy without immediate intervention. The U.S. economy needs a quick solution, and the U.S. Treasury -- while capable in its own right -- could use help from someone like Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reportedly invested $5 billion this week in Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank. Roberts: By some estimates, your energy fund lost $1 billion. Personally, you may have lost almost $300 million. A lot of people say, \"Well, T. Boone Pickens has got a lot of money,\" but by some accounts, that's 10 percent of your net worth. That was a real hit. Pickens: That's a good hit. That's right.  Watch Pickens discuss his, America's problems \u00bb . Roberts: What happened? Pickens: I turned the wrong direction, is what it was. You know, you win some and lose some. Some are rained out, you know. You wish this one had been rained out, but it wasn't. Roberts: I'm sure you saw the president's address last night, or at the very least you heard about it. The secretary of the treasury wants all the money up front. The government wants safeguards on it. They want to make sure there's protection for taxpayers. They want to limit executive compensation. Are you on board with all that? Pickens: I'm ready to go. I'd give [Treasury Secretary Henry] Paulson the money and tell him get it fixed. Roberts: You believe that his plan will work? Pickens: I do. I think it will work, yes. But I think it needs to work quickly. I think you've got to move on with it. I liked Warren Buffett's play into Goldman Sachs. Roberts: Five billion dollars the other day. Pickens: That's right. That showed good confidence and all. So that's another leadership opportunity. Roberts: In fact, you have said, Boone, that you would like to see Warren Buffett handle a lot of these illiquid assets that the government buys up in terms of their disbursement. Pickens: Can you imagine anybody better? Sure, that'd be great if he'd do it. I don't know whether he would or not. But you need to get somebody like Warren to do it. Roberts: You don't think they have the expertise at the Treasury Department to do it? Pickens: Oh, they do have. They may need some help. And that kind of help -- you can't pay for that kind of help.  Watch Bush explain the government's plan \u00bb . Roberts: Let me turn to the energy issue. ... We've talked about your plan to wean America off of foreign oil, use natural gas, you know, get wind power going. You're also -- correct me if I'm wrong -- but you're going to be launching another series of ads here encouraging the presidential candidates to come forward with a plan to wean America off its dependence on foreign energy. Don't they already have a plan? Pickens: No. Neither one of them has a plan. The plan I want is to reduce imports of foreign oil. And we can do that one way. Natural gas is a resource we have in America. It is cleaner, it's cheaper, it's abundant and it's ours. So every gallon of natural gas you put in a tank, you will reduce foreign oil by one gallon. So it's a one-to-one trade-off every time. We could reduce foreign oil by 30 percent. I think we could do it in five to 10 years. Roberts: So what you've heard from them so far doesn't go far enough down the road? Pickens: No. Roberts: But also at the same time, Boone, you are heavily invested in natural gas and there are some people out there who say you're just promoting your business here. Pickens: Well, actually, John, I don't have any natural gas production to speak of. I mean, it's small. It's very small. Now, when I was with [Mesa Power LLP], Mesa was a big natural gas producer. But Boone Pickens is not a big natural gas producer. But I am in natural gas fueling on the West Coast. But all of that, every time you use a domestic fuel, you reduce foreign oil. It's that simple. And we can do it. And this is cheaper. Can you imagine, cheaper, cleaner, abundant and ours? You couldn't pick a better description of what you want to use.", "4385dfb6c732f38bba3d95846255dae0ee492997": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- This month the U.S. government has introduced major changes that will affect millions of travelers to the U.S. who do not need a visa. Instead of filling in the green visa waiver form en route, short-term visitors must register their details online at least three days before they depart. The measure is designed tighten security and make it harder for terrorists who are citizens of the participating countries to easily obtain entry to the U.S. The new system, known as the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), does not become compulsory until January 12, 2009. But travelers are urged to prepare for the new rules in advance. ESTA applies to citizens from the 27 Visa Waiver Program (VWP) countries that includes most of western Europe in addition to New Zealand, Japan, Brunei and Australia. Visitors are recommended to submit applications no later than 72 hours before departure in case further inquiry is necessary. But the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has assured travelers that the system can handle last-minute and emergency requests. Applications can be made at any time, even if travelers have no specific travel plans. And if itineraries change, information can be easily updated on the ESTA Web site. Once travelers are authorized, they can travel for up to two years or until their passport expires, whichever comes first. From mid-January, travelers who have not received approval may be denied boarding, delayed processing, or denied admission at a U.S. port of entry. Passengers must submit the same information that is currently required in the I-94 immigration form. This includes biographical data, travel information as well as questions regarding communicable diseases, arrests and convictions. Registration is possible through the U.S. government ESTA Web site. In most cases, eligibility for travel will be approved immediately. Applicants who receive an \"Authorization Pending\" response will need to check the Web site for updates. Applicants whose ESTA applications are denied will be referred to Travel.State.Gov for information on how to apply for a visa. ESTA does not change the rules for citizens from countries that require visas. But the U.S. is due to extend the visa waiver program and has signed agreements with eight countries including the Czech Republic, Hungary and South Korea. Travelers are advised that ESTA does not guarantee entry into the United States. The final decision rests with the immigration official at the port of entry.", "e8130bb421fab0d7153976dd54f22cbc7b252c82": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States is expelling the Venezuelan ambassador to the United States in response to a similar move by Venezuela, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Friday. \"We have informed the Venezuelan ambassador to the United States that he will be expelled and should leave the United States,\" McCormack said. Separately, the U.S. Treasury Department accused Friday two senior Venezuelan intelligence officials -- Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios and Henry de Jesus Rangel Silva -- and one former official -- Ramon Rodriguez Chacin -- of assisting leftist rebels in the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, with narcotics trafficking. \"Today's designation exposes two senior Venezuelan government officials and one former official who armed, abetted and funded the FARC, even as it terrorized and kidnapped innocents,\" said Adam J. Szubin, director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, in a statement. The action freezes assets the three men may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits Americans from conducting business with them. The U.S. decision to expel the Venezuelan ambassador, Bernardo Alvarez Herrera, is the latest move in an escalating diplomatic battle that pits the United States against two of Latin America's leftist leaders. It comes a day after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced that he was expelling the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, Patrick Duddy. Chavez also said he was recalling the Venezuelan ambassador from the United States. \"He has 72 hours, from this moment, the Yankee ambassador in Caracas, to leave Venezuela,\" Chavez told a crowd of supporters. \"When there's a new government in the United States, we'll send an ambassador. A government that respects Latin America.\" The president said he was making the moves \"in solidarity with Bolivia and the people of Bolivia.\" Bolivian President Evo Morales on Thursday accused the United States of fomenting a coup d'etat by rich eastern department landowners against him, and he called for the U.S. ambassador to leave for allegedly encouraging those protesters. For the past two weeks, the demonstrators in the country's richer eastern lowlands have been protesting Morales' plans to redistribute the country's natural gas revenues. \"Without fear of anyone, without fear of the empire, today before you, before the Bolivian people, I declare the ambassador of the United States persona non grata,\" Morales said Wednesday of Ambassador Philip Goldberg in a nationally televised speech. The United States called the allegations baseless and kicked out the Bolivian ambassador Thursday. The Bolivians \"made it very clear what their intention was and we took them at their word,\" McCormack said Friday. \"We take President Chavez at his word in this particular case, and we have reacted appropriately.\" Before expelling the U.S. diplomat from his country, Chavez also said Thursday that he had uncovered a U.S.-backed plot to remove him from power. \"It's the empire that's behind this,\" he told supporters in a televised address. \"They go around looking for a way to stop our revolution and, with it, to strike all the processes of change that are occurring in our Americas, in the Caribbean, in Central America.\" Chavez then played a four-minute tape of what he said were conversations among current and retired members of the Venezuelan military discussing whom they could count on to support a movement against the presidential palace. He said also that the presence of two Russian warplanes on Venezuelan soil for a training exercise \"is a warning\" to the rest of the world that Venezuela's allies include Russia.", "aecf429fffc229c986755ced9da6933abc2a7e4a": "Four alleged Venezuelan agents have been arrested in the U.S. and charged with trying to persuade a U.S. citizen to keep quiet about a growing international election scandal. Miami businessman Guido Alejandro Antonini Wilson . The U.S. Justice Department said the four wanted to prevent Guido Alejandro Antonini Wilson, a businessman from Miami, Florida, from talking to authorities. On August 4, Antonini Wilson flew in a privately chartered aircraft from Caracas, Venezuela, to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where customs officers discovered $800,000 in cash in his possession. The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday the four men charged wanted to stop Antonini Wilson from revealing the origin of the $800,000. \"The complaint filed today outlines an alleged plot by agents of the Venezuelan government to manipulate an American citizen in Miami in an effort to keep the lid on a burgeoning international scandal,\" Kenneth Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security, said in a written statement. The agents, who worked for the government of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, wanted to ensure Wilson did not disclose \"the source and destination and the role of the government of Venezuela in the attempted delivery of the approximately $800,000,\" the statement said. The Justice Department statement does not say Chavez personally knew of the transaction, but says the office of the vice president and members of the Venezuelan Intelligence Directorate were aware of the matter. U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta in Miami said: \"Today's complaint alleges an effort by the agents of Venezuela to travel to the U.S. for the purpose of coercing our citizens to help conceal the true nature of a growing international scandal.\" Although documents did not identify which candidate was to receive the donation, federal law enforcement officials confirmed the funds were intended for the campaign of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who went on to win the election. The four men -- three Venezuelans and one Uruguayan -- made an initial court appearance in U.S. District Court in Miami on Wednesday afternoon. Those named in the complaint are identified as Moises Maionica, 36; Antonio Jose Canchica Gomez, 37; Rodolfo Edgardo Wanseele Paciello, 40; Franklin Duran, 40; and Carlos Kauffmann, 35. Officials said Gomez remains at large. After Argentine customs found the $800,000 on Antonini Wilson, they seized the cash and sent him to Miami. Later, however, an Argentine judge issued an order for him to appear in court and, at the request of the Argentine government, Interpol issued an international wanted notice for him, U.S. State Department officials said. The officials said that on August 31, the Argentine judge requested Antonini Wilson's extradition. The request was delivered to the State Department on September 4, and Justice and State are currently reviewing the extradition request. The U.S. officials said they do not expect to take any further action while the Justice Department is pursuing its investigation and prosecution of the Venezuelan and Uruguayan nationals arrested in Miami.

U.N. vehicles on Monday pass between lines of civilians fleeing fighting north of Goma, Congo. U.N. helicopter gunships, supporting national army forces on the ground, fired on rebels from the Congress for the Defense of the People in an effort to halt their advance on the village of Kibumba. CNDP is the French acronym for National Congress for the Defense of the People, a Congolese rebel group under renegade general Laurent Nkunda. The village of Kibumba is the location of a U.N.-administered internally displaced peoples camp, just 12 \u00bd miles (20 kilometers) north of the provincial capital, Goma, Bonnardeaux said. Renewed fighting erupted Sunday when the CNDP seized a major military camp and gorilla park, according to U.N. and park officials. The U.N. brokered peace accord in the area in January. On Monday, thousands fleeing Kibumba spurred violent demonstrations in front of the U.N. compound in Goma. The group was angry that a 17,000-person U.N. security force has been unable to protect them from renewed bouts of violence in the country, a U.N. spokesman told CNN. A U.N. spokesman said the U.N.'s mission in Congo was \"under attack\" on Monday. A mission staff member inside the U.N. compound, who did not want to give his name for security reasons, said U.N. security forces had returned fire in an attempt to disperse angry crowds near the U.N. compound. Gunshots could be heard as he spoke on the phone. He said the attack had resulted in several deaths. U.N. officials confirmed one dead in Goma as a result of Monday's demonstrations. The assault died down later in the day, a U.N. spokesman said, but people continued to pelt the building. It was unclear who was attacking, but the staff member told CNN the people were from a village that had been taken over by the CNDP, a Congolese renegade group led by Gen. Laurent Nkunda that seized a major military camp and gorilla park in a renewed bout of heavy fighting Sunday. Thousands of civilians were reportedly fleeing the fighting. Pictures from the region showed long lines of people walking along roads carrying their belongings.  Watch how refugees line roads to get away \u00bb . Soldiers who abandoned the military camp were retreating in vehicles on a main road outside of Goma on Monday, angrily honking their horns at civilians who got in their way, The Associated Press reported. Bertrand Bisimwa, a spokesman for the rebels, told the AP that rebel fighters had moved to within 7 miles (11 kilometers) of Goma. The latest fighting comes after the collapse on Sunday of a tenuous week-old U.N.-brokered cease-fire between rebels and government forces. According to U.N. spokesman Nick Birnback, thousands of displaced civilians in the city of Goma were throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails, angry that a 17,000-person U.N. security force has been unable to protect them from the violence. \"The situation in Goma is very volatile,\" he said. \"But MONUC is taking all available measures to stabilize the situation.\"   Watch more about the fighting \u00bb . The U.N. mission -- known by its French acronym, MONUC -- is in Goma, which is along Congo's border with Rwanda. Although the civil war in Congo -- once known as Zaire -- officially ended in 2003, recent fighting in eastern Congo between government forces and CNDP rebels under has caused tens of thousands to flee their homes, according to U.N. spokesman Michele Bonnardeaux.  Watch ranger describe the violence \u00bb . The conflict and humanitarian crisis in Congo have taken the lives of 5.4 million people since 1998, and 45,000 people die there every month, according to an International Rescue Committee report in January. A senior U.S. State Department official said the United States is pushing hard for cooperation among Rwanda, Uganda and Congo over the situation in eastern Congo. The official said all countries, especially Congo and Rwanda, \"need to work together\" to rein in \"militia groups and other negative forces.\" Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer will travel to Congo and Rwanda to urge both governments to take action, the official said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement Monday calling on all parties \"to make every effort to restore calm among the affected populations.\" The attacks also coincided with the resignation of the U.N. military commander in Congo, Lt.

Caylee Anthony, 3, disappeared in mid-June but wasn't reported missing until a month later. \"Both odor analysis and LIBS results appear to be quite consistent with a decompositional event having occurred in the trunk of the vehicle,\" said the report from Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, noting that the results were preliminary. Testing indicates that the decomposition could be human, the report adds. Casey Anthony, who drove the car, was arrested this month and charged with first-degree murder and other charges in the disappearance of her daughter, Caylee. Caylee was last seen in mid-June, but Casey Anthony waited about a month before telling her family the child was gone. LIBS is laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, one of the techniques used in chemical analysis. Testing was conducted on air and carpet samples from the vehicle. The tests indicated \"the presence of the five key major compounds associated with human decomposition,\" the report said. The tests also found \"an unusually large concentration of chloroform\" in the trunk, according to the Oak Ridge report. Chloroform can be used to render someone unconscious. However, trace amounts of chloroform were also found on a control carpet sample, the report said.  Watch Nancy Grace report on the chloroform discovery \u00bb . The report also says evidence of possible decomposition was found on a hair located among debris in the trunk. The hair is \"microscopically similar\" to one recovered from Caylee's hair brush, the report said, but \"a more meaningful conclusion cannot be reached as this is not a suitable known hair sample.\" The report was released by prosecutors as part of the case's public record. Prosecutors said they would not comment further on them. Todd Black, a spokesman for Casey Anthony's attorney, Jose Baez, said the evidence does not link Casey Anthony to any criminal behavior. \"There's nothing in those reports that links Casey Anthony to any wrongdoing with her daughter, Caylee,\" he said. Casey Anthony was arrested October 14 in a traffic stop after a grand jury indicted her on seven counts of first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and four counts of providing false information to police. If convicted of the capital murder charge, she could face the death penalty or a life sentence. Police and prosecutors have said little about the case, but hundreds of pages of documents and investigative reports have been released. They indicate that Casey Anthony went to nightclubs, entered \"hot body\" contests and text-messaged her friends while her daughter was missing. Copies of cell phone and text records released to the public show that she hardly ever mentioned Caylee during the time just before and after the girl was reported missing. And in May, just before Caylee disappeared, her mother referred to the girl as \"the little snot head.\" Casey's mother, Cindy Anthony, called the sheriff in Orange County, Florida, on July 15, saying her daughter wouldn't tell her where Caylee was. Casey's brother, Lee Anthony, also pleaded with his sister to tell him where Caylee was, according to police documents. She told him she hadn't seen the child in \"31 days.\" When questioned, Casey Anthony gave conflicting statements to police, including some that were later disproved, accounting for the charges of providing false information. She claimed that she dropped Caylee off with a baby-sitter, but when police checked out her story, they learned that the address Casey Anthony supplied belonged to an apartment that had been vacant for weeks. The woman Casey Anthony named as her baby-sitter told police she did not know her. Investigators have said cadaver dogs picked up the scent of death in Casey Anthony's car and her parents' backyard. A neighbor told police Casey Anthony had asked to borrow a shovel. Preliminary air quality tests conducted by the FBI found evidence consistent with human decomposition and chloroform in the trunk of Casey Anthony's car, investigators previously said. Further analysis of Casey Anthony's computer found that she had visited Web sites discussing chloroform, as well as Internet searches of missing children.

Esha Momeni was arrested October 15 in Tehran, Iran, officials said. Esha Momeni, a graduate student at California State University-Northridge, was arrested October 15 in Tehran for unlawfully passing another vehicle while driving, according to Change For Equality, an Iranian women's movement. \"We're seeking additional information about this case,\" State Department spokesman Robert Wood said Wednesday. \"We stand with all those in Iran who are working for universal human rights and justice in their countries.\" Momeni, who was born in Los Angeles, California, is a member of Change for Equality's California chapter. She arrived in Tehran two months ago to work on her masters thesis project on the Iranian women's movement, according to the group, which is in touch with Momeni's family in Iran. Momeni is being held in a section of Tehran's notorious Evin Prison that is managed by the Intelligence Ministry, the group said. Evin Prison houses many Iranian dissidents and political prisoners, and it is where four Iranian-Americans were held for several months last year. All have been released. Iranian officials had promised Momeni's family that she would be immediately released if the news of her arrest was not published, the organization said. \"While Esha's friends and colleagues were insistent about announcing the news of her arrest immediately, based on requests from her family this news was announced with delay,\" Change for Equality said on its Web site. Momeni's parents decided to release the information after they went to Iran's Revolutionary Court on Sunday -- five days after her arrest -- to inquire about her case, and they were told not to return until the investigation into her case has been completed, according to Change for Equality. The Momeni family returned to Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution, but Esha had gone back to the United States several years ago to study for her masters degree, according to a blog post from her journalism professor, Melissa Wall. A separate blog calling for her release (for-esha.blogspot.com) has been established and includes an interview with Wall, who describes her student as \"an exceptionally bright person, very creative and artistic.\" She calls herself \"shocked\" to hear of Momeni's arrest. \"I'm aware that such things happen in Iran, but I'm confident that they have nothing to fear from Esha's research project,\" Wall said. \"It is simply an academic exercise, not meant for publication outside of academic circles. I cannot image why she should be held in detention.\" On her personal blog, Wall said, \"She is a videographer who was simply interviewing Iranian women. She has broken no laws, has not done anything wrong.\"", "e82cc00daf7771c0b92386c369c4cb2e3018d304": "DECATUR, Georgia (CNN) -- Police quietly wait by the front door of the small, brick suburban Atlanta home as investigators tell 48-year-old Lajuana Robinson, a mother of nine, \"I'm going to have to put you in handcuffs.\" Investigators take a woman from her Decatur, Georgia, home after her arrest in a truancy case. She's charged with violating her parole in a truancy case because three of her younger children have missed hundreds of days of school combined. While students have always suffered the consequences of playing hooky, parents in DeKalb County, Georgia, are facing one of the more aggressive anti-truancy programs in the country, one where punishment can include time behind bars. DeKalb's program is one of a growing list targeting truancy in U.S. schools, said Jodi Heilbrunn, senior research and policy analyst at The National Center for School Engagement. \"Ten years ago, there weren't too many anti-truancy programs, but now they are springing up like rabbits,\" Heilbrunn said, and \"they come in many varieties.\" In some communities, a single school takes on its own problem. In others, like Jacksonville, Florida, and Niagara Falls, New York, the battle is system wide. And New Jersey is about to institute a statewide system, targeting six cities with the worst truancy problems. The DeKalb County program, started in May 2006, was designed to get children from the age of 6 to 16 back in class. If a child has 10 or more unexcused absences from school, parents are referred to an intervention program where they sign a contract agreeing to make sure their children get to class. If they fail to do that, they face the judge. According the county solicitor general's office, around 300 families have gone to court so far.  Watch how a Georgia mother ends up in handcuffs \u00bb . Most of the parents who are cited are charged with educational neglect, said DeKalb County Solicitor-General Robert James. Most of those charged plead guilty and get probation, he said. The probation usually involves parenting classes, counseling, and follow-up visits for progress and attendance reports. Parents who violate their probation run the risk of thousands of dollars in fines, and up to 30 days in jail per count. \"We are putting parents in jail, or we are bringing them in orange jumpsuits not just because their children are not in school, but because they got a subpoena or summons to come to court, or to come to a diversionary program and they refused to do so. So this is more about accountability than anything,\" James said. James said it is critical in his county to keep kids in school. The Georgia Department of Corrections found that more than 60 percent of its inmates in 2007 didn't earn a high school diploma, and James quoted an internal survey that found 84 percent of inmates in DeKalb County's jail are high school dropouts. LaTara Tankersley-Jones and Craig Scott, investigators for the DeKalb County Solicitor-General's office, are tasked with locating \"truant\" parents and serving court-ordered summons. Jones and Scott, usually with assistance from local law enforcement, also must arrest parents who have not complied with a court-ordered probation or failed to show up to court in the first place. Scott said arrest is the least desirable option, but \"the bottom line is, we have a warrant and even if the children are there, you're going to have to come with us.\" Robinson was no stranger to the investigators. The county had intervened on behalf of her children before, even providing Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas presents last year. The mother had been ordered to be sure her children went to school and to attend parenting classes herself. She had done neither, investigators said, earning herself a night in jail and a face-to-face with the judge the next day. Judge R. Joy Walker presides over the Educational Neglect courtroom. On a recent Friday in October, she handled each of the 80 or so cases before her in a fast, firm, and efficient manner. One by one, each parent, mostly women, has an opportunity to explain to Walker why they are in her courtroom. Investigators Jones and Scott are there as well. They say they hear the same excuses over and over again. \"They can't get up, or they have so many things that are going on in their life that are preventing them from making sure that their kids go to school,\" Jones said. Walker agrees to probation for most of the parents in her court this day, including Angela Harris, who pleads guilty to 24 counts, one for each of the 24 days her child missed school. \"I have never in my 48 years been in trouble, so this is all new to me,\" she tells the judge. \"The state is offering you 24 months (of probation), but if you mess up I'm going to put you in jail,\" Walker replies. Walker has put 15 \"truant\" parents behind bars. Lajuana Robinson is released. But she'll have to return to court another day to explain why her children aren't in school. So far, the success of the DeKalb program has been limited. \"We have seen some small results,\" James said. Attendance has increased by 2 to 3 percent over the past year. \"I am not satisfied by that, but in a school system of over 100,000 kids, you are talking about 2,000  to 3,000 more children attending school than what we had the year before last,\" he said. James says that he has received some interest from neighboring counties about the program and he thinks it is only a matter of time before they adopt similar ones. \"We have a lot of parents who feel we should not be intervening in family business, but it's the law. In Georgia, in DeKalb County, attendance is the law, and we plan to enforce it.\"", "6a2372a02a0776850f8cd26e0467b756b64873ae": "KAUHAJOKI, Finland (CNN) -- Police in Finland have identified the 10 victims in Tuesday's college shooting as eight female students, a male student and a male teacher. The bodies of the victims were also badly burned after being set on fire. The gunman -- identified by authorities as Matti Juhani Saari -- also died after turning the gun on himself. In addition, one woman was seriously wounded in the shooting. Finnish police had interviewed and released Saari a day before Tuesday's bloody rampage at a college in Kauhajoki in southwestern Finland, the country's interior minister said Tuesday. Finnish broadcaster YLE reported that police found a note at Saari's apartment saying he planned the attack since 2002 because he hated \"people and the human race,\" according to Jari Neulaniemi of the National Bureau of Investigation. Neulaniemi told YLE that the shooting took place in a single classroom. Nine of the victims were found in the classroom and one in the corridor, the report said. Authorities say they became interested in the 22-year-old student after he posted four videos on YouTube. One of them showed him firing a pistol at a shooting range. Saari did not directly threaten anyone in the videos, so there were no grounds for further action, national police Commissioner Mikko Paatero told YLE. However, Interior Minister Anne Holmlund suggested the government will investigate how the police handled the case.

Authorities hoped that was enough to take care of any threat, but \"now we see that it was not,\" she said.

Authorities learned about the videos Friday but could not reach Saari until Monday, Paatero told YLE. Police also searched his home, YLE reported. Four videos of a man firing a pistol at a shooting range were posted by a \"Mr. Saari\" from Kauhajoki, where the college is based, according to his profile on video-sharing Web site YouTube. The profile also included a video tribute to the Columbine High School shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, at the top of the man's favorites list.

SUNY at Canton in New York has provided a designated \"pet wing,\" home to a variety of animals. (UWIRE) -- As university residence halls seek to transition into more homey environments -- with additions like full kitchens and single-stall bathrooms -- pet ownership is still forbidden for the majority of dorm residents. But several universities, including MIT, have now added some pets to the \"acceptable\" list of dorm possessions. According to a recent article published by The Boston Globe, students at MIT who reside in four of the school's 11 undergraduate dormitories can bring cats with them to school, thanks to a policy implemented several years ago in an effort to curb students from housing forbidden animals. Other schools have jumped on the four-footed bandwagon: Stephen's College, a women's college in Columbia, Missouri, allows for many household pets, including dogs, provided that they are vaccinated and under forty pounds. And the SUNY at Canton in New York has provided a designated \"pet wing,\" home to a variety of small caged animals and cats since 1996. While animal companionship is largely viewed as a welcome addition to family homes, there are many roadblocks that have deterred Tufts from altering its pet policy. \"We don't have a policy that allows for dogs or cats or ferrets or monkeys -- you name it -- and ... the main reason is so many people have allergic reactions to animal dander,\" Dean of Student Affairs Bruce Reitman said. \"It's one thing in a family, where everyone agrees that this is what they want and no one has an allergic reaction to the animal. But in a residence hall, where there is no such communication or agreement, it's hard and people are affected.\" While Tufts students are currently not permitted to have more than a small fish tank in the dorm setting -- in addition to service animals -- this has not always been the case. During a failed experiment that ended around a decade ago, faculty members, residence directors and graduate teaching assistants were allowed to own pets in an attempt to encourage residence. \"We were trying to entice [people]to come live in the halls, and ... they wouldn't come unless you allowed the pets,\" Reitman said. \"In order to pragmatically get [them] to come in, we said 'Okay, let's do this.' Then people said, 'No, this isn't fair, I can't live here.' Not many students complained, but enough did.\" According to Dr. Margaret Higham, medical director of Health Services, the prevalence of allergies and asthma on campus would make a more lenient pet policy problematic. In addition, dorm cleanliness would be noticeably impaired by the allowance of pets, she said. \"Pets need to be taken care of ... Litter boxes need to be cleaned daily,\" Higham said. \"The dorm rooms were not built with the need to ventilate for that type of situation. And what about fleas? Once they are introduced, they would spread rapidly through all of the furniture. I do not see students being able to care for animals adequately in the dorm setting.\" Even without canines currently roaming the quad, there has been a modest history of animal neglect that calls into question a student's ability to provide for an animal properly. \"I think some fraternities in recent years did have animals,\" Reitman said. \"There were concerns or complaints when spring break came along, because there is this animal, not cared for ...the animal activists came in here and said, 'That's no way to treat an animal,'\" Reitman said. \"A residence facility -- be it a sorority, fraternity or residence hall -- is not necessarily a good fit for the animal.\" Reitman said he had reservations about allowing pets in designated residence halls, like MIT does. \"If you designate certain buildings as 'pet buildings,' you are taking that building, in essence, from people who don't want to live in that type of environment,\" Reitman said. \"You can't do that with very popular halls that go first in the lottery, because there would be no end to complaints about that. You just get into this equity political-pragmatics issue pretty quickly.\" \"Developing pet-specific dorms would be a huge logistical struggle,\" Higham said. \"Once pets have been in a specific room, that room is 'contaminated' with pet dander and will be 'allergic' for extended periods.\" But a number of studies have been released touting the psychological benefits of owning a pet, arguing that the relationship serves as a daily de-stress mechanism and source of increased happiness. While Reitman viewed the calming influence of a pet-owner bond as beneficial, he associated the necessity of pet companionship with two distinct groups, neither of which includes college students. \"I'll say the usefulness in ownership and responsibility for the aged and the young jumps off the page to me,\" Reitman said. \"For older folks ... the companionship and presence of the animal is life sustaining in a lot of ways,\" Reitman said. \"For young kids and teenagers, the responsibility of pet ownership is a great model for taking on a commitment. It's clearly needed, but probably a little less so in our middle years.\" Sophomore Kara Brown, who suffers from asthma, said it is a bad idea to allow pets in residence halls. \"I wouldn't love it if cats were allowed just because being anywhere near them makes me sick ... My breathing tubes start to close,\" Brown said. \"I also feel like people usually have too much going on to really take care of a pet, especially now in college when you are already doing so much that takes a lot of effort.\" \"I don't think it's fair to other people who are living in the dorms because everybody needs to agree that they want an animal in their dorm,\" junior Jenny Hong said. \"It's not only you and your roommate, but you're sharing a huge space with everyone else. It would also cause a lot of mess and possible destruction to school property.\" Still, Hong admitted that she wouldn't rule out the possibility of owning a pet if the policy changed. \"I would consider bringing a pet, but I would only go for small pets -- maybe a hamster or gerbil,\" she said. \"Never a cat, though, or a dog.\"", "3f9ac7fa4ee8126ec03a8aac122601ffccf4dc9c": "ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- The mother of missing Florida toddler Caylee Anthony was arrested and charged Friday with forgery, fraudulent use of personal information and petty theft, the Orange County Sheriff's Department said.

The former employees of Graziano Transmissioni had gone to meet with company management over their reinstatement, said Noida police Inspector Manoj Pathak. The meeting turned violent, and the mob attacked Chaudhary with iron rods, Pathak said. On Tuesday, India's labor minister, Oscar Fernandes, drew sharp criticism after he said Chaudhary's death should serve as a warning to management, according to CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN. \"The workers should be dealt (with) with compassion and should not be pushed so hard that they resort to whatever that had happened in Nodia\" CNN-IBN quoted Fernandes as telling reporters. The minister later apologized, telling CNN his comments had been taken out of context. He said the murder of the boss could never be justified.

The plane crash victims' bodies laid out at a makeshift morgue in Madrid. A total of 153 people were killed. Initially, there were indications that an engine might have caught fire as the plane was taking off, but the source said airport video shows the plane lifting off, veering sharply right and then dragging or skidding down the right side of the runway. There was a cloud of dust, the source said, followed by a fireball. Canary Islands regional President Paulino Rivero said after meeting with Spain's prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, that the latter had seen the video and described it as showing the plane using up all the runway as it tried to take off but then never reaching adequate altitude, The Associated Press reported.

The plane's departure had been delayed for nearly two hours due to a technical problem with the aircraft, Mendoza said, but it was not clear whether that fault was related to the crash. \"The heating problem was treated and corrected by Spanair maintenance personnel,\" he said. \"We have reviewed the details on this faulty situation with the inspectors of our civil aviation authority,\" he said, \"and we all come to the conclusion that was nothing abnormal in this resolution of that problem.\" Madrid observed five minutes of silence Thursday to honor the victims, and the country began three days of mourning.

Spanair, a low-cost airline that has a flight-sharing agreement with Lufthansa, is owned by SAS Scandinavian Airlines. Twenty-two of the passengers were children, two of them infants, Spanair said. After contacting families, the airline published the names of those aboard on its Web site.

Former biodefense researcher Bruce Ivins killed himself in July, authorities say. Bruce Ivins, who authorities say killed himself in July as the Justice Department prepared to charge him in the anthrax case, is alleged to have sent the e-mail to himself last September. An FBI agent quotes the message in an affidavit accompanying applications for search warrants for Ivins' e-mail accounts. \"Yes! Yes! Yes!!!!!!! I finally know who mailed the anthrax letters in the fall of 2001. I've pieced it together! Now we can finally get this over and done with,\" the e-mail reads. In it, the former biodefense researcher says he plans on turning information over to his lawyer and that his lawyer would then give it to authorities. The e-mail does not say who Ivins believed was responsible. \"I'm not looking forward to everybody getting dragged through the mud, but at least it will be over,\" the e-mail reads. \"Finally! I should have it TOTALLY nailed down within the month. I should have been a private eye!!!!\" The documents -- which the Justice Department says are the last Ivins-related search warrants that had yet to be released to the public -- also contain new details about allegations that Ivins wanted to kill his co-workers. The details are in an account of a July 9 group therapy session during which Ivins allegedly said he was a suspect in the anthrax investigation. According to an FBI agent's account, Ivins was \"angry at the investigators, the government, and the system in general.\" \"He said he was not going to face the death penalty, but instead had a plan to kill co-workers and other individuals who wronged him,\" the account reads. \"He said he had a bullet-proof vest, and a list of co-workers, and added he was going to obtain a Glock firearm from his son within the next day, because federal agents are watching him and he could not obtain a weapon on his own.\" The FBI agent also alleges that Ivins said during the session that he had walked around the \"ghetto\" areas of Frederick, Maryland, near his home, late at night \"hoping that someone would try to hurt him so that he could stab them with a sharp pen.\" That description is similar to something Ivins allegedly wrote on YouTube referencing a winner of the television game show \"The Mole.\" Authorities said Ivins' YouTube message read: \"The least someone could do would be to take a sharp ballpoint pin or letter opener and put her eyes out, to complete the task of making her a true mole!\" General details of the therapy session have previously been reported. After the meeting, social worker Jean Duley contacted authorities and Ivins was taken into custody. He was released after being evaluated at two hospitals. Notes allegedly written by Ivins at the time of his hospitalization were found in the trash at his home after his death. According to the FBI, he wrote about the stresses in his life and the possibility of facing prison time. Ivins' attorney, Paul Kemp, maintains Ivins didn't carry out the attacks and says the new documents prove nothing. \"There is simply nothing new here, nothing that is proof against Dr. Ivins,\" Kemp said Wednesday. The anthrax probe continues, Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said. \"We are working to close the investigation soon,\" Boyd said, adding that \"investigative efforts\" and \"administrative measures\" need to be finished. The anthrax attacks occurred less than a month after the September 11, 2001, suicide attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. Letters filled with bacterial spores were sent to Senate Democratic leaders and news organizations. Those who died were Washington postal workers, a New York hospital worker, a supermarket tabloid photo editor in Florida and a 94-year-old woman in Connecticut.

Bolivian President Evo Morales says opposition leaders are trying to overthrow the government. The central government of leftist President Evo Morales, Bolivia's first leader from an Indian majority centered in the western highlands, is conducting talks with governors of largely white provinces in the east who want autonomy. Tension between the two sides erupted into violence that killed at least 30 people in September. In addition, differences about the country's future have threatened to split the country. Julian Torrico, a peasant leader, said he and other Morales supporters will storm the eastern city of Santa Cruz if the talks, which started Thursday, do not yield progress. \"We will go into Santa Cruz and respond with force because they have (marginalized) us and massacred us, so we will massacre them and we will take their land away from them,\" he said.  Watch protesters march in Santa Cruz \u00bb . \"The fight here is between poor and rich. The government of Evo Morales took power by a majority and now these opposition governors don't want to let him govern,\" Torrico said. Anyelo Cespedes, president of the Santa Cruz Youth Union, which opposes Morales, said they don't want a dictatorship or a communist regime. \"We have our way of life and we don't want that changed,\" he said. The central government and eastern governors are discussing topics that include the distribution of natural-gas revenues, autonomy for several eastern provinces and the president's plan for a new constitution. Those negotiations may offer one of the final chances to reverse Bolivia's slide toward violent instability, according to Gonzalo Chavez, an analyst. \"This is probably one of the few opportunities that we're going to have to solve the problems of the country,\" he said. Four of nine provinces in Bolivia have declared autonomy from the central government in referendums this year. Morales, an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and former Cuban President Fidel Castro, said the moves could cause Bolivia to disintegrate. The eastern opposition leaders have long opposed a decision of the Morales government to divert some revenue from oil and gas produced in the region to pay for government programs for the elderly. They have also opposed his plans to revise the constitution to give greater rights to the indigenous majority. The differences flared into violence with opposition protesters occupying government buildings and energy installations. Morales has said the opposition leaders are trying to overthrow the government. He expelled U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia Philip Goldberg on the grounds that he urged anti-government protesters to get violent, an assertion the United States has denied. \"This is a coup in the past few days by the leaders of some provinces, with the takeover of some institutions, the sacking and robbery of some government institutions and attempts to assault the national police and the armed forces,\" Morales has said. Opposition leaders said they merely want their demands met. Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza of the Organization of American States arrived in Bolivia on Friday to encourage dialogue. He expressed optimism based on the \"preliminary results\" from the talks. Representatives of the Organization of American States and the 12-nation Union of South American Countries are among a group of international observers that has come to Bolivia for the negotiations. Ivan Canelas, a government spokesman, said the talks provide a critical opportunity to break an impasse that has split the country for months. \"We understand that making peace requires the suspension of all forms of pressure,\" he said. Gov. Mario Cossio of the eastern Tarija state said he and other opposition leaders hope to reach a final agreement. He said they hope \"to build a national agreement that Bolivia needs, that the Bolivians want.\" He said the goal is to \"give peace back to our country and give certainty to Bolivia.\" CNN's Karl Penhaul and Gloria Carrasco contributed to this story.", "71a483178d64864769034b45e7ced8ce89e21b27": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Pop star George Michael was cautioned by police in London after being arrested in public toilets on suspicion of possessing drugs, the UK's Press Association reported.

China's He Kexin kisses her gold medal last week after winning the Olympic women's uneven bars. The committee asked the International Gymnastics Federation to clarify the situation, said spokeswoman Giselle Davis. She said she wouldn't call it a formal investigation. The Chinese women's gymnastics team won a gold medal in a team competition at the Summer Olympics Games. Five members won medals in individual competitions. Yet commentators, bloggers and others have raised questions about whether about half the members of China's team were old enough to compete -- athletes must be at least 16 in the year the games take place. In women's gymnastics, younger teenage girls can have an advantage over older competitors due to their often smaller, more agile bodies and lighter frames. \"We have asked the gymnastics federation to look into what have been a number questions and apparent discrepancies on this case,\" Davis said. A top Chinese Olympic official said questions regarding the ages of the athletes have been dealt with previously. \"The eligibility of the athletes has already been investigated and authorized by the international federation and, if they hadn't been cleared, they wouldn't have participated in the games,\" said Wang Wei, executive vice president of the Beijing Olympic Committee. Chinese officials provided the Olympic committee with passports, showing that team members were of legal age, but numerous challenges have been made. The latest came from a blogger known as \"Stryde Hax.\" The blogger claims to have uncovered proof that Chinese gymnast He Kexin is only 14.  Watch bloggers question China's gymnasts \u00bb . In Internet searches, \"Stryde Hax\" allegedly uncovered Web pages showing lists complied by China's General Administration of Sport that show a 1994 date of birth for He. That would make her 14 -- too young to compete in the Olympic Games. CNN has not been able to independently verify the information, but snapshots of the Web pages appear to back up the claim. Other bloggers have joined the search and reported similar results. The New York Times conducted its own investigation, producing similar results that seem to implicate He and two other members of the team. The Times uncovered a 2006 biography on He that lists her birthday as January 1, 1994. \"According to online sports registration lists in China, half the team - He Kexin, Yang Yilin, Jiang Yuyuan - would be under age,\" the Times reported in July. The International Gymnastics Federation, however, has said that those gymnasts were eligible and that the ages on their passports were correct. Chinese gymnastics coaches defended their team Friday. \"Our athletes participating in these games all conform to the age regulations of the Olympics,\" said Huang Yubin, head coach of the men's and women's teams. \"Asians have different figures than people from the West, so that's what caused their suspicion,\" Huang said, referring to media inquiries. \"They shouldn't be suspicious.\" CNN's John Vause contributed to this story .", "970d07b5ddd665d792cc6e8338e9e7a7e0826d75": "PARKER, Colorado (CNN) -- Matt Keil didn't wait for a call to serve his country. Six weeks after Tracy and Matt Keil married in 2007, he was hit by a sniper fire while serving in Iraq. He enlisted in the Army after graduating from high school in 2000, and when the Iraq war started, Keil volunteered to go. Because he was single, he wanted to take the place of a parent, wife or husband who would otherwise be sent. \"I wanted to go over and serve my country,\" he recalled. After a year-long tour of duty in Iraq, Keil returned home to Colorado, where he met a young woman named Tracy who lived in the same apartment complex. He says he knew they were meant to be. \"I woke up one morning, and my roommate was gone. I called him up and asked him what he was doing. He said he was down by the pool hanging out,\" Keil said. \"I asked him if there were any hot girls down there, and he said, 'Yeah, there are.' \" And the rest is history. Matt and Tracy began dating and fell in love, but he was soon told that his unit was being sent back to Iraq. Even though he knew redeployment was part of his job, this time things were different. He and Tracy were engaged to be married.  Watch their story of love interrupted \u00bb . At the time, the enemy in Iraq was growing stronger, and Keil's unit was headed to Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province and a violent insurgent stronghold. Keil had been in Ramadi in 2004 and knew the mission would be dangerous. \"They were definitely built up a lot more on our second tour,\" he said. \"Fallujah had just ended, and a lot of fighters from Fallujah had fled to nearby cities, and that's what we were up against.\" Though their wedding plans were put on hold, Matt and Tracy decided to marry as soon as he could get a leave of absence. \"He got one of the earliest leaves you could take and came home in January,\" Tracy Keil remembered. \"The main reason we got married was, even though we planned on having a bigger wedding later, what if something happened?\" On February 24, 2007, six weeks after their wedding, something did happen. Keil, an infantry squad leader, was part of a major offensive to reclaim a portion of the city. His squad was ambushed, leaving 11 men severely wounded. After helping evacuate his wounded men, Keil and his men entered an abandoned house. He went to the roof to look out for any potential danger. \"I jumped up on the tallest part of the roof to lay a camel net on top of the stairwell to kind of hide us from sniper fire,\" Keil said. \"That's when I got shot right in the right side of the neck. Hit me like a ton of bricks.\" It wasn't until he was back at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington that the couple realized the severity of his injury. Tracy was abruptly informed of his condition while Keil was heavily sedated. \"A doctor came in, thought I knew and made a comment about being paralyzed from the neck down,\" Tracy Keil recalled. \"He didn't know that nobody had sat down to tell me. ... I just collapsed.\" When Keil awoke, a doctor informed him that the bullet had hit his spinal cord and explained that he had a \"Christopher Reeve-type injury.\" After the initial shock, Matt and Tracy began to understand the full implications. For Keil, who was independent and admits to being stubborn, that was hard to swallow. \"Realizing that my wife was going to be helping me eat, cleaning me up, doing things like that, it was kind of devastating,\" he admitted. But the newlyweds stayed optimistic and started focusing on the next steps. One of the most urgent issues was figuring out where they would live once Keil was out of the hospital. Tracy and her mother would bring Keil house-hunting. \"They would get me in a manual wheelchair and carry me up flights of stairs,\" Keil explained. But they quickly became frustrated by what they found. Every house they saw would have to be dramatically modified to meet Keil's needs. And that meant costs that he and Tracy could not afford. Then, in August 2007, when Keil was just a month away from being released from the hospital, his wife received news that would change this lives. This time the news was good. A friend of the couple's had submitted their story to Homes for Our Troops, an organization that builds specially adapted homes for disabled veterans. John Gonsalves, founder and president of Homes for Our Troops, and the organization had selected Matt and Tracy to receive a house built specifically to meet their needs. Best of all, it was free. \"It's one of the most life-changing events that's ever happened to us, especially after being injured,\" Keil said. \"We're going to be in this house that's fully accessible, has everything that it needs to take care of me, wide-open floor plan easy for Tracy to take care of me, and it's just an absolutely beautiful house.\" After breaking ground in April, Homes for Our Troops utilized hundreds of volunteers, donations and community outreach to build the house so it would be ready for the dedication ceremony September 27. Gonsalves, who started his career in construction, said he realized how many men and women would be returning home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with severe injuries and very specific needs. He wanted to volunteer with an organization that built homes designed for these disabled veterans. When he realized none existed, he started his own. He says he's frustrated by the lack of urgency in helping America's veterans. \"It just seems like this time around, we weren't really asked to do anything. It was kind of 'go about your lives,' and I'm thinking, how can everybody just put it in the back of their mind and go about their daily lives when our sons and daughters and mothers and fathers are in a faraway place putting their lives on the line?\" Gonsalves said. Homes for Our Troops spends an average of $250,000 on each home, and only 7 percent of the group's money goes to administrative overhead. The rest goes directly to helping disabled veterans. It gives people in the community an opportunity to give back through volunteering. The Keils' home is the 33rd project the organization has completed, and the group has 40 homes in the works. There are 3 million veterans receiving disability compensation, and more than 250,000 of those are 100 percent disabled, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. With two wars still being waged and hundreds of thousands of America's military men and women fighting, it's likely the need for these homes will increase. The home has given Tracy and Matt hope for their future together, and they look forward to giving back. \"This gives us security for our life,\" Tracy Keil said. \"This is where we can have our kids, and this is where we can raise our family.\" \"We're going to live in this house for the rest of our lives, and eventually when it's our time to pass, we're going to find a family to donate it to that really needs it,\" Matt Keil said. \"Our kids will be made well aware of that!\"", "937717a38bf1a174febfd009a9bc991d54d3ce6e": "(CNN) --   Global activist and U2 frontman Bono attended the United Nations General Assembly in New York to push world leaders to join his ONE campaign in fighting disease, poverty, and hunger. He talked to CNN's John Roberts on \"American Morning\" about recent successes and what's next. Bono said politicians who love signing checks but not cashing hurt plans to help the world's poor. ROBERTS: All this talk has been about the economy collapsing, $700 billion bailout. Congress is absolutely absorbed with that. Did that in any way affect what you were trying to do this week? Are people more focused on this economy than in helping out developing nations? BONO: We got good news this week. I know normally I'm on your program with bad news -- the whingeing rock star -- but it's great. There's a disease, malaria -- it's 3,000 African kids die every day of mosquito bites. Sounds mad, but it's true. And people have committed and it looks like the funds are on the table so that that disease will be no more by 2015. That makes people like me punch the air and everyone who wears a ONE T-shirt and all our white band campaigners on college campuses all over the country -- it was a great day for them yesterday so we're celebrating that. I know it's extraordinary, that while you're having this meltdown on the markets, that people could even concentrate on this stuff, but I'm really grateful that they did. We had both [presidential] candidates make very powerful statements about the necessity for nonmilitary tools, for instance, in foreign policy. This is an America that both candidates want to show to the rest of the world -- the greatness of America. ROBERTS: So you're hearing what you want to hear from these candidates? BONO: Yeah. And you couldn't imagine a few years ago that you would have candidates so close to an election talking about this stuff, so yeah.  Watch Bono say how he uses his star status on politicians \u00bb . ROBERTS: You were talking to Christine Romans outside the studio, who just did that piece for us a few minutes ago on what else could you do with $700 billion. What could you do with $700 billion? BONO: We wouldn't be asking for that kind of money. These are serious matters, people have lost their jobs. But I think the bill for the whole world -- so America would be like a third of it -- for $25 billion you could absolutely change the world. You could put kids in school, most kids in school. You could eradicate diseases like malaria, as we're saying. We could change the water supplies. But what's important is that people who want to change the world, want to see their country, they see it as a patriotic act to show the world innovation of America, technology of America, pharmacology of America. ROBERTS: For $25 billion, you could put every kid who's out of school in the world into school? That seems like a lot of people for $25 billion. Pretty good return on your investment. BONO: It's a great return on investment. You heard me on your program before talking about debt cancellation. Strangely Americans don't know that because of debt cancellation there are already an extra 29 million African children in school. That's incredible. Because people got out on the streets on the (RED) campaign and stuff like that, there's now 2.5 million Africans on AIDS drugs, which are expensive. So your country is turning for me in the right direction on these issues. ROBERTS: So you're hearing some of what you want to hear, particularly on the malaria issues. But the European Union had promised to increase aid by $50 billion between 2005 and 2010. It looks like they're going to fall $40 billion short. BONO: They are, but they're still ahead of America. That's the bad news. You don't want to get me into the ring. ROBERTS: Absolutely! Come on. BONO: We've had meetings with Sarkozy this week as well as talking with McCain and Palin and as well as always talking with the Obama campaign. We do keep up the pressure on the Europeans, but the Europeans are way ahead of America on aid, just to put it in context. But you're right. They're not coming through on all of it. We will torture them too. That's our job. ROBERTS: You talk a lot about these United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Let me go over a couple of those. It was supposed cut global poverty in half by the year 2015. Universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment by 2010. Begin to reverse the incidence of malaria by 2015. How far along that road are we? BONO: The Millennium Development Goals are in a bit of trouble. It is astonishing to me ... ROBERTS: Whose fault is that? BONO: You know, politicians. They love signing checks, but they don't like cashing them. They love the photograph. These G-8 meetings, you'll see myself and my partner Bob Geldof arm-wrestling with politicians up against the wall. ROBERTS: You're very effective at doing that. You get access to a lot of places. I remember I was on a trip with President Bush once, and you walked on Air Force One. BONO: It's the absurdity of celebrity. I don't consider myself a celebrity in this sense, I think I'm an activist who knows what I'm talking about. But yeah, we get access, and we use it. It's true that there was a very ambitious plan signed up in 2005 that further committed what was decided in the year 2000, that we could actually across eight goals completely change the face of poverty and hunger in the world. And there was a $25 billion bill by 2010 that would enable them to do that. They haven't come through on that. And another day I'll tell you why, but today I'm punching the air because malaria will be no more by 2015. And it's Americans, people from the private sector -- Peter Chernin, Ray Chambers, all kinds of people, Bill Gates, your mayor of this city, [Michael] Bloomberg, is an amazing guy. He's working on this stuff. I just want Americans to know that side of their country because I'm a fan of America. And, again, you would have candidates, you know, like John McCain taking time out this week to talk to us, Barack Obama before. This is fantastic. ROBERTS: I was reading your blog on financialtimes.com. You've been writing all week, doing a great job too. You mentioned in one of your pieces you've been writing some lyrics. And I'm wondering where the lyrics are going. BONO: Statistics don't rhyme. Songwriting comes from such a different part of my brain and such a different part of who I am. ROBERTS: Are you writing about all this? BONO: No, it's strange. It's very strange. I used to work in a garage when I was a kid pumping gas, and I used to dream when I was pumping the gas about getting to rehearsals on a Saturday so I could be with my band and write songs. The work that I'm doing now, as we say, we're working like a dog, living like a shih tzu. We're spoiled people. We travel well, but we work. On these issues, because you're working for the world's poor, we work like dogs. But I find myself at times, sometimes I just wake up in the morning, and I just want to be back with my band in a rehearsal room. ROBERTS: You will be soon. New CD coming out next year. BONO: I'm not complaining about the work. This is the most inspiring thing I've ever been involved in in my life, and it's working. It really is working. And that's why I'm on your show this morning. I just want to thank Americans. ROBERTS: Good luck on the new CD coming out next year.

Simpson on kidnapping and armed robbery charges. Judge Jackie Glass decided prosecutors had a \"race-neutral\" reason for dismissing the potential juror. The judge made no official mention of the jury's makeup, but prosecutors revealed in court that no blacks were on the jury. A black man and black woman, however, are among six alternate jurors. Defense attorneys had argued the prosecutors were deliberately trying to exclude blacks, but Judge Jackie Glass denied their challenges. Opening arguments are scheduled to begin Monday in the case against Simpson and a co-defendant, Clarence Stewart. Prosecutors say Simpson and five other men stormed into a Las Vegas hotel room on September 13, 2007 to recover sports memorabilia that Simpson said belonged to him. Prosecutors say at least two men with Simpson had guns as they robbed a pair of sports memorabilia dealers. If convicted on all counts, Simpson faces a possible sentence of life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and has told CNN he was trying to get his property back. Four of five Simpson's original co-defendants have struck deals with the prosecution to testify against Simpson. One testified in a pre-trial hearing that \"O.J. Simpson wanted me to have a weapon.\" Another testified that Simpson \"wanted me to help him acquire some guns.\" An attorney for Simpson, Yale Galanter, has disputed that. \"O.J. Simpson did not know that there were guns in that room,\" Galanter said.", "b5b9281cd7c937fba6ccb79a7a3096a638118e3f": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has introduced a $1,000 note -- $10 trillion in the old value -- as the country battles to end cash shortages in the hyper-inflationary environment. Zimbabwe's currency is trading around Z$350 -- $35 trillion in the old value -- against U.S. dollar. However, analysts said the new note -- which can only buy a loaf of bread -- will not ease pressure on cash shortages because of the ever-increasing prices. \"It will not make even a small impact. What we need in Zimbabwe is a clear change of policies, start production and then inflation will start easing up,\" said John Robertson, an economic consultant. \"The zeros seem to be coming back no matter how often they slash them.\" In August, Zimbabwe slashed ten zeroes on the currency; two years earlier the country slashed three zeros. The zeroes keep bouncing back in the country that has an inflation rate of 11.2 million -- the highest in the world. Zimbabwe's agro-based economy has been on a free-fall for more than a decade now. The situation was exacerbated by the destruction of commercial agriculture in 2000 when President Robert Mugabe's government embarked on a violent land grab from white farmers and gave it to inexperienced black farmers. Mugabe denies that he is to blame for the country's economic collapse, citing economic sanctions that have been placed on Zimbabwe. Since 2000, Zimbabwe's currency has been depreciating against major currency.

He was 71. iReporter Kevin Eckhoff met George Carlin at a show in St. Louis, Missouri, in 2004. iReporter Chris Sargent says, \"He could play with words and phrases in ways that would put the most highly regarded English professors and linguists to shame.\" CNN.com invited readers to share tales of meeting Carlin, and the impact he had on their lives. Below is a selection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Melanie Phillips of Salem, Oregon: I met George Carlin in the early '70s at a performance he gave at Los Angeles Valley College. The large auditorium was filled to capacity so they closed the doors leaving about 40 people outside. When Carlin came up on stage he asked, \"Who are all those people staring in the windows?\" The host told him the fire marshal had locked them out. Carlin thought for a moment then asked, \"How many people are allowed to be on stage?\" The legal limit was 50. The comedian turned to the audience and said, \"Forty of you people in the first few rows come up on stage and give those people outside your seats.\" My friend and I ran up on stage and we all gathered in a circle around him, like at a campfire. For the next 90 minutes, Carlin did his entire act by taking our requests, \"Hippy Dippy Weatherman,\" \"Seven Words ...\" After the show was over, he passed through our little circle, shaking hands (including mine) as he quickly made his way off stage to avoid being swamped by fans. It was one of my most memorable experiences and a grand gesture for the 40 fans who had been locked out. Alexis Karlin of Boston, Massachusetts: When I was little my dad had this box car and one day he put a George Carlin tape in it and it got stuck. So for a year until the car died we listened to this George Carlin tape over and over and over again. ... I won't miss that car but I will miss George Carlin. Chris Sargent of Laurel, Maryland: Last night, the world's greatest comedian and champion of the First Amendment, George Carlin, died at the age of 71 from heart failure. He was one of the few things my father and I had in common, as I have fond memories of sitting in the living room with him, watching George on HBO, and laughing our a***s off. His gift was to make us think about everything. He could play with words and phrases in ways that would put the most highly regarded English professors and linguists to shame. Kevin Eckhoff of Jacksonville, Illinois: George was in classic form as he arrived for a show in late 2004 at the Touhill Performing Arts Center in St. Louis. This was my second time meeting George. He signed the photo from our first meeting, took this new photo, and then proceeded to begin signing my friend's albums. Before he started, he paused, fanned out the records, looked at each, and in his own special way said, \"You know, I go from city to city and you guys (autograph collectors) always have my records in such great shape. Just where the **** do you get these records in such pristine condition?\" We all busted out laughing. We'll miss you George! Thanks for a great memory.", "58d946d675490dcf4677d0802d6b9b7726339f36": "(CNN) -- Sarah Palin did not visit troops in Iraq, a spokesperson for the Republican vice presidential nominee confirmed Saturday, as new details emerged about the extent of the Alaska governor's foreign travel. Gov. Sarah Palin's aide confirmed to CNN details of her foreign travel Saturday. In July of last year, Palin left North America for the first time to visit Alaskan troops stationed in Kuwait. Palin officials originally said her itinerary included U.S. military installations or outposts in Germany and Kuwait, and that she had visited Ireland. A Palin aide in Alaska had said Iraq was also one of the military stops on that trip. The Boston Globe, however, reported Saturday that in response to questions about the trip, Alaska National Guard officials and campaign aides said Palin did not go past the Kuwait-Iraq border. In addition, campaign aides also confirmed reports to CNN Saturday that Palin's time in Ireland on that trip had actually been a refueling stop. The Obama campaign -- which has increasingly accused the McCain campaign of deliberately lying in ads and on the stump -- was quick to highlight that story, along with a news report that explored whether the McCain campaign has been sending out wildly inflated crowd estimates. The McCain team has twice pointed to law enforcement as the source for those estimates -- but the same officials denied to Bloomberg News that they had provided the numbers cited by the Republican nominee's campaign. \"The McCain campaign said Gov. Palin opposed the bridge to nowhere, but now we know she supported it,\" said Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor in a statement. \"They said she didn't seek earmarks, but now we know she hired a lobbyist to get millions in pork for her town and her state. They said she visited Iraq, but today we learned that she only stopped at the border. Americans are starting to wonder, is there anything the McCain campaign isn't lying about?\" A Palin spokesperson also confirmed that the governor had visited Mexico on a personal vacation. She has also visited Canada. The Palin revelations Saturday are the latest in a series of barbs between the two presidential campaigns. McCain, appearing Friday on ABC's \"The View,\" was aggressively pressed on Palin's qualifications to be vice president as well as his new campaign ads that several independent fact-check groups have called misleading. Co-host Barbara Walters asked about Palin's reformist credentials, noting McCain has served in Washington for more than two decades and asking repeatedly, \"Who's she going to reform, you?\" McCain answered by saying Democrats have controlled Congress for two years, but then Walters quickly interrupted: \"But tell me who she is going to reform -- we aren't talking about the economy, we're not talking about housing; she was chosen to reform, who is she going to reform?\" Appearing somewhat frustrated, McCain said, \"The Democrat Party, the Republican Party, even an independent. She'll reform all of Washington.\" Walters, seeming somewhat exasperated, asked, \"How? What will she do? What is she going to reform specifically, senator?\" McCain said Palin had a strong record on vetoing earmark spending.  Watch more of McCain's appearance on \"The View\" \u00bb . \"The fact is she was a reform governor, she took on an incumbent governor of her own party and defeated him. She sold the airplane and fired the chef,\" McCain said, referring to Palin's efforts to put her predecessor's state jet up for auction on eBay and her dismissal of the governor's personal chef. \"She sold the airplane at a loss,\" Walters interrupted. (The jet failed to draw sufficient bids on eBay and later was sold at a loss through an ordinary aircraft brokerage.) Also on Friday, both campaigns accused each other of engaging in lies, unfair attacks and gutter politics in a series of television ads and memos. McCain's campaign released a television ad, titled \"Disrespectful,\" that accuses McCain's Democratic rival of launching desperate attacks and smears against Palin. In the McCain ad, the announcer says the Obama camp had \"lashed out at Sarah Palin\" and dismissed Palin as \"good-looking\" as the Democratic nominee's face appears on the screen. The announcer also says the Democrats had said Palin was doing \"what she was told\" and had \"desperately\" called her a liar. \"How disrespectful,\" the announcer says. \"And how Gov. Sarah Palin proves them wrong, every day.\" Obama never made any of the statements the McCain camp released to support the ad, and the comment that Palin was \"good-looking\" was made by the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Sen. Joe Biden, in a self-deprecating joke when he was asked what the obvious differences were between the two vice presidential nominees.  Watch the McCain ad \u00bb . Biden repeatedly has said on the campaign trail that he respected Palin and that he thought she was qualified for the vice presidency. FactCheck.org pointed out the quote from an Obama adviser that Palin was doing \"what she was told\" was taken out of context. The quote is taken from the response of Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, in which he said Palin had misrepresented Obama's legislative record. \"Maybe that's what she was told\" about his voting record, Axelrod said. The Obama campaign, meanwhile, launched two television ads Friday. In one, the campaign paints McCain as being out of touch by showing pictures of him when he first entered the Senate in 1982 as disco music plays. The ad also highlights McCain's own admissions that he lacks computer skills and does not use e-mail.  Watch the Obama ad attacking McCain \u00bb . In the second Obama ad, the candidate himself appears. \"We've heard a lot of talk about change this year. The question is, change to what?\" Obama asks. The ads come as Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, issued a tough memo to reporters that accused McCain and his campaign of turning to \"smears, lies and cynical attempts to distract from the issues.\" CNN's Peter Hamby, Ed Hornick and Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this report.", "e237f558c1695d3c40119c815646bb6d14de0c89": "KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Ten French soldiers were killed Tuesday in fighting near the Afghan capital of Kabul after 100 insurgents attacked a patrol, authorities said. French soldiers patrol in Afghanistan in May 2008. French and NATO authorities confirmed the deaths and said 21 other soldiers were wounded in the fighting in the Sarobi area in Kabul province, about 30 miles northeast of the capital. The clashes began late Monday afternoon and continued into Tuesday, when the casualties occurred, French officials said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said his \"determination is intact\" to continue \"this battle against terrorism for democracy and liberty.\" \"The cause is just. It is an honor for France and its armies to defend them,\" said Sarkozy, who will travel Tuesday night to Afghanistan, the Defense Ministry said. Last month, nine U.S. soldiers were killed in fighting in eastern Afghanistan. U.S., British, Canadian and Dutch troops have been engaged in much of the combat in Afghanistan. The United States has been urging other countries in the NATO-led alliance to help ease the burdens of those troops on the front lines. About 1,670 French troops serve in Afghanistan under NATO's International Security Assistance Force, according to ISAF's Web site. Before this incident, a total of 12 French troops had died in several incidents during the Afghan war, mostly in combat. As for the latest fighting, NATO said the initial patrol -- which included Afghan forces -- had been \"reinforced with quick reaction forces, close air support and mobile medical teams.\" It said \"a large number of insurgents were killed.\" Gen. Zahir Azimi, an Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman, said Tuesday that Afghan army forces rushed to the battle scene soon after the attack took place. He said 27 militants were killed and 14 were wounded in the fighting, and 13 of the bodies were recovered by the Afghan army. He said one of the dead militants was identified as a Pakistani national. The Taliban posted a Web statement saying its forces attacked an \"American\" convoy, killing 20 soldiers and destroying five military tanks. It also said foreign forces later Tuesday bombarded the region and killed five Taliban militants and several civilians. The fighting came after authorities tightened security on Monday in anticipation of militant attacks on the country's Independence Day. Several suicide bombers struck an American base about 12 miles from the border with Pakistan in Khost province on Tuesday, but U.S. and Afghan forces repelled the onslaught. Seven insurgents were killed in the attack on Forward Operating Base Salerno, including three suicide bombers who blew themselves up after forces from the base encountered them more than 3,000 feet from the base, ISAF said in a statement. U.S. and Afghan troops noticed the approaching militants by their \"special behavior,\" the spokesman said. Helicopters flew in to attack them, the force said. ISAF said it suffered no casualties. Gov. Arsallah Jamal of Khost province said four commandos -- presumably Afghans -- were wounded when the militants struck late Monday. A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said 15 suicide bombers with small arms and machine guns entered the base and inflicted heavy casualties -- claims that the NATO-led force and Khost governor dismissed. That attack came after a suicide car bombing outside the same base killed 10 Afghan civilians and wounded 13 others Monday, the U.S. military said. Two other would-be bombers were killed before they could carry out attacks, Jamal said. Afghan forces stopped a second would-be car bomb near the base, performed a controlled detonation and detained a suspect, the NATO-led force said. This comes as a source from the Afghan Defense Ministry, who declined to be named, confirmed that Pakistani army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani arrived in Kabul on Tuesday morning to meet with Afghan and NATO military officials. In southern Afghanistan, a suicide bomber struck a Canadian foot patrol on Tuesday in the Kandahar province district of Panjwayee, local police said. The bomber and an Afghan interpreter for NATO forces were killed and a NATO soldier and a child were wounded, police said. The attack occurred as troops chatted with villagers in the district's main bazaar. The Taliban, in a Web statement, said 11 foreign soldiers were killed or wounded in the attack.

Oscar Tulio Lizcano was kidnapped on August 4, 2000 near the Colombian town of Riosucio. Oscar Tulio Lizcano, his hair disheveled, appeared too weak to stand for long when he met the news media Sunday, hours after stumbling onto a military patrol -- and freedom. Lizcano suffered from hunger and disease in captivity and endured isolation in the company of leftist rebels who often would not let him talk, he and Colombian authorities said. \"Maybe my incoherence is for a lack of speaking,\" Lizcano told reporters. \"I was unable to talk with the guerillas who guarded me.\" Lizcano said he had little to read in the jungle except \"The Odyssey\" by Homer. He suffered from malaria and other illnesses and once ate nothing but hearts of palm for six or seven days, said Juan Manuel Santos, the Colombian defense minister. \"This is big news for the whole family,\" said Lizcano's sister, Amparo Lizcano. \"We were waiting for the guerrillas to give our brother back alive before he died.\" The former congressman fled about three days ago with the assistance of one of his captors, a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a leftist rebel force that has been fighting the government for more than 40 years in a war that also has involved right-wing paramilitaries and drug traffickers.  Watch release of FARC hostage \u00bb . President Alvaro Uribe appeared on television Sunday with the ex-FARC rebel -- known by the alias \"Isaza\" -- and said the man will receive compensation and permission to resettle in France with his family. He said that's in keeping with a Colombian government policy that rewards rebels who desert and help hostages gain their freedom. Police officers and soldiers pinpointed the location of the FARC unit holding Lizcano several months ago, Santos said. They monitored the location for about five months and took steps to seal off possible escape routes, he said, as they planned a rescue operation using information gleaned help from a rebel who deserted October 2. Troops started that rescue operation Saturday -- only to discover that \"Isaza\" and Lizcano had decided on their own to escape. The two men wandered through the jungle for three days and nights before encountering a Colombian army patrol Sunday, said Santos, the defense minister. Lizcano was kidnapped on August 4, 2000 near the Colombian town of Riosucio. He and his former captor stumbled Sunday onto a patrol near the border of the states of Risaralda and Choco, in central Colombia, authorities said. The FARC holds an estimated 750 hostages in Colombia. Its members have justified hostage taking as a legitimate military tactic. The rebels have been battered this year by government raids that killed several top commanders, the death by apparent heart attack of their founder and a wave of desertions. Government commandoes tricked the FARC in July and freed their most prized hostage, the former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, in an elaborate ruse that also liberated three U.S. defense contractors and 11 other hostages. On Sunday, Lizcano offered words of encouragement to those hundreds who remain trapped in the jungle, captives of the FARC. \"Hold on. Hold on,\" he said. \"One day you will enjoy your freedom, too.\" -- CNN's Karl Penhaul contributed to this report .", "9a083eb718131f6ee239f33359cf0a387febb153": "BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- German federal police seized two suspected terrorists from a Dutch passenger aircraft at Cologne airport Friday shortly before it was due to take off for Amsterdam, officials told CNN.

South African President Thabo Mbeki announced his resignation in a televised address Sunday. His replacement, African National Congress Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe, will be sworn in as South Africa's president Thursday. Mbeki announced he was resigning on Sunday, prompting threats from several Cabinet members to follow suit -- but the outgoing president urged them to stay in office, government sources said. The resignations, which include Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota, will take effect Thursday when Mbeki steps down, a government statement said. \"All the ministers have expressed their availability to assist the incoming administration in the hand-over process and any other assistance that might be sought from them,\" the statement said. The finance minister's assistant told CNN that Manuel is willing to serve in the new government, if needed. Three deputy ministers have also tendered their resignations, a government statement said. A spokesman for South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress, confirmed that it has named Motlanthe as its choice to succeed Mbeki. Motlanthe will stay in office until elections in the spring of next year, which ANC President Jacob Zuma is widely expected to win. Earlier this month, the ANC asked Mbeki to step down after a judge threw out the corruption, fraud and racketeering case against Zuma -- Mbeki's political arch rival. The judge called the case invalid and accused Mbeki's government of political interference. Mbeki -- who has been South Africa's president for nearly 10 years -- spoke of some of his achievements when he formally announced his resignation on Sunday during a televised address.  Watch the significance of Mbeki \"falling on the sword\" \u00bb . \"I depart this office knowing that many men and woman in South Africa have worked to achieve better lives for all,\" Mbeki said. Under his leadership the country has had the longest period of sustained economic growth in the South Africa's history and has reached out to indigent people in an unprecedented way, Mbeki said. Mbeki said the country still has economic, corruption and crime challenges to face in the future. And he gave his vote of confidence to the country's next leader without naming who that leader would be. Gwede Mantashe, secretary-general of the African National Congress, announced Saturday that the party -- which Mbeki has been involved with since his teens -- had asked him to leave before his term was up. Mbeki agreed to do so, he said. Mantashe said the ANC made the decision \"for the citizens of South Africa, so there could be stability within the country\" and so the ANC movement could remain \"stable and unified.\" The case against Zuma -- who replaced Mbeki as ANC president last year -- was thrown out in September 2006, but the National Prosecuting Authority recharged him. Judge Chris Nicholson made no ruling on Zuma's guilt or innocence, and he could be recharged. Political observers doubted that would happen because of Zuma's popularity, particularly with the Communist Party and trade unions. Zuma has denied the charges. He said the case was politically motivated, and harmed his chances to become the ANC's presidential nominee. He could have faced at least 15 years in jail if convicted of accepting bribes from a company that got a contract in a multibillion-dollar arms deal. He also faced charges of having a corrupt relationship with his former financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, who is serving a 15-year sentence for soliciting bribes for Zuma and using Zuma's political influence to benefit his businesses. Mbeki, 66, succeeded Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president in June 1999. Critics alleged he pushed for the corruption charges against Zuma. Mbeki recently brokered a power-sharing deal between Zimbabwe's political rivals, who signed the agreement on Monday in an effort to put aside the violent past and end the crisis that has paralyzed Zimbabwe since disputed national elections in March. Under it, longtime Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe remains president, while his perennial rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, has become prime minister and the coordinator of government affairs.", "a21efae8eb68279e8ea05bb61db1ce13da64c55e": "Editor's note: Join Roland S.

A Black Man's View of America.\" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says Lifeway Christian Stores should be given hell for its actions against GospelToday. (CNN) -- In the 19 years that Teresa Hairston has published her magazine, GospelToday, she has never faced a major situation with Christian bookstores across the country that carry the publication. She's tackled any number of issues over the years,and has featured a number of celebrities and ministers, ranging from Yolanda Adams to Bishop T.D. Jakes to Kirk Franklin. But when the Atlanta, Georgia, entrepreneur decided to feature five female pastors on her cover this month, she says, Lifeway Christian Stores treated her like she had converted her Christian publication to something akin to the tastes of porn purveyor Larry Flynt. Apparently, the owner of Lifeway, the Southern Baptist Convention, wasn't too happy with Hairston telling the story of female pastors, because the women go against their 2000 decree that only men can serve in the role of reverend or pastor. According to Hairston, the Christian company didn't even give her the courtesy of a heads-up. \"We got an anonymous tip,\" she told me Tuesday on The Tom Joyner Morning Show, and after checking it out, she discovered that the magazine had been removed from the shelves in all of Lifeway's 100-plus stores nationwide and had been placed behind the counter. \"They have never called me,\" Hairston said. \"Never sent an e-mail. Nothing. I had to go see my distributor to verify what they had done.\" The actions of Lifeway didn't stun me. I had seen this movie before. A few years ago, my wife was a longtime Lifeway teacher. She had taught at the company's teaching centers for years, but then one day, she was notified that she would have to take down her Web site and comply with their rules against female pastors or be dropped as a teacher. Her crime? Calling herself the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin. It wasn't that she did so for the heck of it. She graduated from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary; was the first female staff pastor at Houston's Brookhollow Baptist Church/the Church Without Walls, a Southern Baptist Convention church; and has been leading folks to the Lord all over the country for 20 years. She was angered by Lifeway's decision but made it clear that she didn't serve the bookstore or even the Southern Baptist Convention. She made a commitment to serving Jesus Christ and was not about to back away from her call to ministry because a male-dominated organization decided that its interpretation of the Bible calls for a woman not to be in the pulpit. So she cut them off and kept on calling herself the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin. Religious folks will quickly say that Scripture is clear that women can't be pastors and lead men, yet Hairston says that when she featured Pastor Paula White on her cover two years ago, Lifeway didn't take any action against the magazine. Anyone who has served in a church or been a member of any faith knows that there are those who have strict interpretations of their faith's writings, while others have a different interpretation. I've heard Brookhollow's pastor, the Rev. Dr. Ralph Douglas West Sr., preach several sermons stating that what Paul wrote in 2 Timothy with regards to only men preaching was specific to that church and not a blanket ban. Second, there were instances where Paul wrote that his views were his own and not mandates from God. That is a doctrinal fight that any of us can have any time (and I love it how these same Bible thumpers ignore the biblical story of Deborah, who was a judge in the Old Testament -- and was over men). But what is a greater issue is that Lifeway clearly has no respect for freedom of the press. Here is arguably the top Christian bookstore in the country making a decision based on their teachings and applying it to a magazine. A spokesman for Lifeway Resources, which runs the stores, was quoted in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week as saying of female pastors, \"It is contrary to what we believe.\" So does Lifeway and, by extension, the Southern Baptist Convention, fight vigorously for freedom of religion, but it doesn't give a hoot about the other freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution? I now wonder whether Lifeway makes it its business to cull through any number of magazines and search for stories that go against its doctrine and pull them from the shelves. This is the kind of nonsense that drives more people away from religion. I suppose it's fitting that this story would come out the same time as Bill Maher releases his religious documentary, \"Religulous,\" which skewers all the major religions for their dogma. I'm sure he feasted on positions of the Southern Baptist Convention. The conduct of Lifeway and the Southern Baptist Convention is shameful, and they owe Hairston an apology for their actions. Yet she's taken it in stride, saying that instead of giving the company hell, she'll \"give them heaven.\" I say, give them a lot of hell for this, because they deserve it for actions.

Meanwhile, Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin headed home to Alaska after spending the week campaigning with McCain. The pair drew a crowd of more than 20,000 in the sturdily Democratic county of Fairfax, Virginia, on Wednesday. That was their largest crowd to date. After that event, Palin returned home so she could attend her son's deployment ceremony on Thursday. Track Palin enlisted in the U.S. army exactly one year ago. His brigade is going to Iraq.  Watch more on Palin's return to Alaska \u00bb . Later Thursday, Palin will give her first television interview with a national media outlet since being named as McCain's running mate. The Alaska governor will spend two days with ABC's Charlie Gibson. The interview will be part sit-down, part walk-and-talk at various locations in Alaska. So far, Palin has taken no questions from reporters traveling with her on the campaign trail. An issue that could come up in the interview is the controversy that emerged this week over her per diem charges as governor. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that Palin had billed the state a per diem for 312 days she spent at home, and requested reimbursement for plane rides and hotel rooms for her husband and children, including a $707 room when her daughter accompanied her on a trip to New York to attend a Newsweek forum. The paper noted that officials said the claims were justified under existing state regulations. The McCain campaign said that Palin had reduced yearly travel expenses by roughly 80 percent of the amount spent by predecessor Frank Murkowski. Palin's spokeswoman Maria Comella said the governor's top priority was \"creating accountability and transparency in government to root out waste and corruption.\" \"Gov. Palin is obviously expected to travel frequently around the state for community events and to meet with Alaskans. This is part of her job, and it's reasonable that her travel expenses, which were reduced dramatically from the previous administration, would be covered,\" Comella said in a statement. Palin is expected to rejoin McCain on the trail early next week.

The tainted milk powder has already sickened more than 6,200 babies. Earlier in the day, authorities announced the arrest of 12 more suspects in the investigation, provincial police said. The arrests bring to 18 the number of people detained, according to the Hebei Public Security Bureau. Twelve of those arrested are involved in the collection of milk and the production of milk products, authorities said. Authorities accuse the other six of illegally selling the chemical added to the milk. More than 1,300 infants are hospitalized, said Li Changjiang, China's director of quarantine and inspection, on Wednesday. Their conditions include malnutrition, kidney stones and acute renal failure. Inspectors have been deployed across the country to test producers' inventories.

Thousands of tons of the tainted milk powder have been recalled, including pullbacks by Mengniu Dairy Group, China's largest milk producer, and the Sanlu Group. Chinese investigators have found melamine in nearly 70 milk products from more than 20 companies, Li said Wednesday. Products made by Sanlu had the highest concentration of the chemical. It is not the first time Sanlu has been connected to a scandal involving tainted milk powder, according to China Daily. In 2004, at least 13 infants in the eastern Anhui province died of malnutrition after drinking milk powder that had little to no nutrition. The illegally manufactured milk was falsely labeled with the Sanlu brand, according to the paper. The vast majority of the tainted formula was consumed domestically, but it is known to have been exported to Taiwan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Yemen, Chad and Burundi, according to Li. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said no Chinese baby formula has been allowed on the market in the United States.

McCain questioned whether Obama was aware of the al Qaeda base. Obama's response was: \"There was no such thing as al Qaeda in Iraq until George Bush and John McCain decided to invade Iraq.\" McCain was in Tyler, Texas, and Obama was in Columbus, Ohio. \"I understand that Sen. Obama said that if al Qaeda established a base in Iraq that he would send troops back in militarily. Al Qaeda already has a base in Iraq. It's called al Qaeda in Iraq,\" McCain said. \"It's a remarkable statement to say that you would send troops back to a place where al Qaeda has established a base -- where they have already established a base.\" McCain's comments come in response to remarks Obama made Tuesday night in a debate with Sen. Hillary Clinton. He was asked if the president would have the right to go back into Iraq in order to suppress an insurrection after downsizing the U.S. troop presence.  Watch what Clinton and Obama said about the war \u00bb . \"I always reserve the right for the president ... to make sure that we are looking out for American interests,\" Obama said. \"And if al Qaeda is forming a base in Iraq, then we will have to act in a way that secures the American homeland and our interests abroad.\" A statement by McCain's press office Wednesday said, \"Is Sen. Obama unaware that al Qaeda is still present in Iraq, that our forces are successfully fighting them every day, and that his Iraq policy of withdrawal would embolden al Qaeda and weaken our security?\" Obama responded to the latest attacks from McCain, saying his comments were taken out of context. Obama said the question he was asked during the debate was a \"big hypothetical.\" \"I said, 'Well, I would always reserve the right to go in and strike against al Qaeda if they were in Iraq,' so you know, this is how politics works,\" Obama said at a rally in Columbus. \"McCain thought that he could make a clever point by saying ,'Well let me give you some news Barack, al Qaeda is in Iraq,' like I wasn't reading the papers, like I didn't know what was going on.\" \"I said, 'Well first of all, I do know that al Qaeda is in Iraq. That's why I've said we should continue to strike al Qaeda targets. But I have some news for John McCain, and that is that there was no such thing as al Qaeda in Iraq until George Bush and John McCain decided to invade Iraq.\" Obama continued to blast Bush and McCain, saying, \"John McCain may like to say he wants to follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, but so far all he's done is follow George Bush into a misguided war in Iraq.\" McCain in his statement said \"the Democratic presidential contenders deny progress and see only gloom and doom. Where is the audacity of hope when it comes to backing the success of our troops all the way to victory in Iraq? What we heard last night was the timidity of despair.\" The latest exchange comes as a new poll suggests McCain would pose a tough match for the eventual Democratic nominee.

Only 1 in 3 children in Medicaid received any dental care over a year time span, according to a new report. \"Dental disease remains a significant problem for children aged 2 through 18 in Medicaid,\" the U.S. Government Accountability Office report concluded, referring to the federal/state health program for poor people. According to the report, which used data from 1999 to 2004, about 6.5 million children enrolled in Medicaid had untreated tooth decay in 2005 and were nearly twice as likely as children with private health insurance to have untreated tooth decay. The GAO report was ordered after widespread publicity of the case of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old boy boy who died last year in suburban Washington when an untreated infected tooth led to a brain infection. Driver \"had extensive dental disease and his family was unable to find a dentist to treat him,\" the report said. The report said 14.8 percent of Medicaid recipients said their children had not gotten necessary dental care because their dentist refused to accept Medicaid, which typically pays providers less than private insurers. \"Clearly, the oral health care system failed this young man,\" said Dr. Jane S. Grover, first vice president of the American Dental Association in testimony Tuesday to the Committee on House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Domestic Policy. \"All of us -- practitioners, payers, parents and policymakers -- need to come together and make the system work for the most vulnerable among us,\" she said. The report found that, nationwide, only one in three children in Medicaid had received any dental care in the year before the survey was carried out, and one in eight reportedly had never seen a dentist. In comparison, more than half of children with private health insurance had gotten dental care during the prior year. \"Fundamental changes to the Medicaid program are long overdue to prevent the possibility of future tragedies like Deamonte and to ensure that all low-income children have the same access to oral health care services enjoyed by the majority of Americans,\" Grover said. Efforts are under way to fix the problem. She cited plans to open eight dental schools in addition to the 57 currently in existence and said a new job -- community dental health coordinator -- has been created. The coordinators will be trained to work in clinics and schools to ensure emergency care is provided to children, she said. \"If there had been a CDHC in the school that Deamonte Driver attended, we believe this tragedy could have been prevented,\" she said. \"Through a routine exam, a CDHC could have spotted a simple cavity, filled the cavity with a temporary filling, and made arrangements for care by a dentist,\" she said. The CDHC will also help families enroll in Medicaid and get transportation to appointments, she said. But even if the numbers of dentists increase, Congress must act to increase fees for those participating in Medicaid to match private rates, she said.", "02d9e932600aaab304c025f704b20f0863c5329c": "BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Consumers in Beijing's malls and shops are shunning the milk and poultry sections -- for good reasons. Poultry products, including eggs, may be contaminated with melamine through animal food. They are shocked and scared by the news headlines: some food produced in China is tainted with melamine. \"Of course I'm worried,\" says a woman shopping in Nanxiaojie Market. Stop eating eggs? \"That's not possible,\" she tells CNN. \"If there's a problem with eggs, it should be solved fundamentally.\" Chinese premier Wen Jiabao says China will take steps to win back consumers. \"We will use our actions and high quality of our food products to win the trust and confidence of Chinese people and people around the world,\" he told reporters at the end of a two-day summit of Asian and European leaders in Beijing last weekend.  Watch more about the tainted food scandal \u00bb . \"Three minister-level officials have resigned and a government investigation is going on. Whoever is responsible must be brought to justice. We need to protect the Made in China brand,\" said Chinese analyst Victor Gao. But the problem could be more pervasive. The state-run Nanfang Daily published an investigative story saying that adding melamine into animal feed has become an \"open secret.\" The report said adding melamine into feed started in the aquatic farming industry five years ago, as a way of faking higher protein levels.  Learn more about chemical melamine \u00bb . It then spread into other agro-industries such as poultry. Even more shocking is the allegation that the melamine added is from industrial waste material. CNN contacted the Ministry of Agriculture about the story, but got no immediate response. Two years ago, reports revealed pet food exported from China to the United States was spiked with melamine and had sickened and killed dogs. Several weeks ago, the food scandal spread to milk, biscuits and candies. Now, it is tainted eggs. So far, no illnesses or deaths have been linked to eggs. Tests in Hong Kong last week showed eggs exported by a Chinese company are contaminated with excessive levels of melamine. In recent days three other brands of eggs have also been found to contain the chemical. Small wonder egg sales at the Xinfadi, a wholesale market in Beijing, dropped by 10 percent this week, according to the state-run China Daily. Chinese officials say the source of the problem is melamine, an industrial chemical used to produce plastics and fertilizer. Melamine is high in nitrogen. Unscrupulous milk suppliers would water down milk and spike it with melamine -- but in amounts that allowed it to still pass quality tests. Agriculture experts speculate that eggs tainted with melamine may be the result of tainted feed given to hens. That begs the question: if melamine was in the animal feed, will it make into the meat, and into consumers' bodies? Ingesting melamine in large doses over an extended period of time could cause kidney stones and other illnesses, agriculture and health experts say. But taking in a small amount of melamine poses no such danger. \"If it's taken over a long period of time, maybe, but if it's ingested only for short period of time it does not pose harm on animals,\" says He Jiguo, a professor of food science and nutrition at the China Agriculture University. He says the animals that end up being slaughtered do not live that long and do not actually ingest enough melamine for it to build up in their systems. The dogs and cats that were sickened in the United States were probably eating treats and meals tainted with melamine over a long period of time, he explains. Until the situation is resolved, worried grocery shoppers in Beijing say they'll just have to eat fewer eggs and more bean-products, like soybeans.", "3fd5c851a37d6a8baef719a8225249e9d4cf22a7": "(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama on Monday blamed lobbyists, special interests and \"an ethic of irresponsibility\" in Washington for the financial crisis that has swept the country in recent weeks. Sen. Barack Obama said Monday there needs to be more oversight in Washington. The senator from Illinois sided with congressional Democrats, who say a government bailout of the financial sector must include government oversight. \"We cannot give a blank check to Washington with no oversight and accountability, when no oversight and accountability is what got us into this mess in the first place,\" Obama said. President Bush's top economic advisers this weekend presented a $700 billion plan to Congress to take control of \"illiquid assets,\" including bad mortgages. Bush urged Congress to pass the plan as is, but Democrats on the Hill already are circulating a counterproposal. Sen. John McCain, Obama's Republican rival for the presidency, said Monday that the government's proposal puts too much power into the hands of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. In a conference call Monday with reporters, McCain's top campaign officials refused to say how the senator from Arizona would vote on the plan because it is not yet clear what the final version will contain. At a campaign event Monday in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Obama laid out the reforms he would pursue as president to avoid another economic crisis.  Watch Obama talk about the crisis on Wall Street \u00bb . First, Obama said that he would reform \"our special interest-driven politics.\" He said members of his administration would not be able to use their position as a steppingstone for lobbyist careers.  Watch what Obama says about McCain's role in the situation \u00bb . Obama said he would make the government \"open and transparent\" and put any bill that ends up on his desk online for five days before he signs it. Secondly, Obama said he would \"eliminate the waste and the fraud and abuse in our government.\" He pointed to fixing the health care system and ending the war in Iraq as ways to cut costs. Obama also said that he and his running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, would crack down on excessive spending from both parties and close loopholes for big corporations. Obama said he would pursue \"updated, common-sense regulations\" in the financial market. Earlier Monday, McCain told voters he was \"greatly concerned\" about the government's proposed rescue plan. \"Never before in the history of our nation has so much power and money been concentrated in the hands of one person,\" McCain said at a town hall meeting in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The Republican candidate said that while he admires and respects Paulson, \"this arrangement makes me deeply uncomfortable.\" McCain said a high-level oversight board should be created to shepherd the government's proposed $700 billion bailout plan. McCain criticized Obama for not putting up a plan to address the financial situation. \"At a time of crisis, when leadership is needed, Sen. Obama has simply not provided it,\" he said.  Watch what McCain says about Obama's leadership \u00bb . Obama has said several times since the recent Wall Street crisis that, in meeting with top economists, he was encouraged to not roll out a specific plan for fear of overly politicizing the work of Congress on a government bailout of financial firms. He has, however, offered ideas for the plan -- including limiting pay for executives of businesses that are bailed out by the government and making sure the effort includes a specific plan for the money to be repaid. McCain on Monday proposed creating a bipartisan oversight board that would be able to \"impose accountability and establish concrete criteria for who gets help and who doesn't.\" The Republican presidential candidate said the board should be made up of \"qualified citizens who have no agenda.\" He pointed to Warren Buffett, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg as potential board members. Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, supports Obama. Romney backs McCain, and Bloomberg is an independent. McCain also called for \"transparency and accountability\" on Wall Street and urged Congress to act quickly. The Bush administration's proposal to bail out the financial system is the centerpiece of what would be the most sweeping economic intervention by the government since the Great Depression. The plan would allow the Treasury to buy up mortgage-related assets from American-based companies and foreign firms with a big exposure to these illiquid assets. The aim is for the government to buy the securities at a discount, hold onto them and then sell them for a profit. The government's rescue plan follows a week of roller-coaster activity in the financial markets. In the lead-up to Bush's proposal, the country saw the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, a Bank of America buyout of Merrill Lynch and a government bailout of insurer American International Group Inc.

David Petraeus, whose 20-month term in Iraq saw a significant decline in violence with the deployment of additional U.S. troops. U.S. forces are in \"mission transition,\" Gates said Monday, with some troops going home and others backing up Iraqis. \"There is no question we will still be engaged, but the areas in which we are seriously engaged will continue to narrow,\" Gates said during his flight to Iraq. \"The challenge for Odierno is how do we work with the Iraqis to preserve the gains we've already achieved and expand on them even as the number of U.S. forces are shrinking.\" Odierno is expected to set the stage for an eventual U.S. withdrawal. Petraeus will become the new chief of U.S. Central Command, in charge of American forces in the Middle East and Afghanistan. Gates, who is making his eighth trip to Iraq, said Petraeus played a \"historic role\" during his tenure. \"I think he would be the first to acknowledge that he has had a brilliant strategy,\" he said. \"But it has been the brigade commanders and company commanders and the soldiers and Marines and others on the ground who have actually made it work. \"We have lost a lot of lives, but it's really been an extraordinary effort of translations of a great strategy into a great success in a very difficult circumstance.\" At a dinner on the eve of the change-of-command ceremony, Gates presented Petraeus with the Defense Superior Service Medal. He also gave Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, the Distinguished Civilian Service Award -- the highest award given by the secretary of Defense to those not in uniform. \"I have never seen a working relationship like this,\" Gates told the two men. \"To find leaders to do what many considered impossible, you two are such men.\" Odierno will receive his fourth star on Tuesday in a separate ceremony ahead of the change-of-command ceremony. The defense secretary on Monday also met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and told the Iraqi leader that he has seen a notable improvement in security since his first visit to the country nearly two years ago, according to a statement released by the prime minister's office. Gates said the cooperation between Iraqi security forces and coalition forces was responsible for the improvement in security, according to the statement, and al-Maliki praised the successes of the Iraqi armed forces. The prime minister said the gains have brought about a greater sense of normalcy in the country, allowing many internally displaced Iraqis to return to their homes. They also have spurred the economy, he said. The situation in Iraq is far different from that in past years, the prime minister noted. As Gates arrived in Iraq, three bombings -- two in Baghdad and one in Diyala province's Balad Ruz -- provided a rude counterpoint to that message. Two car bombs went off in central Baghdad.

The business magazine has been compiling its annual list of departed celebrities' earnings since 2001. Since 2003, the feature has coincided with Halloween. This year, the top 13 celebrities earned a combined $194 million in the last 12 months. The magazine says it talked to people inside the celebrities' estates and calculated their gross earnings from October 2007 to October 2008. Some celebrities are staples on the list, which is in its eighth year. Cartoonist Charles Schulz, who created Snoopy, Charlie Brown and the assorted cast of \"Peanuts\" characters, is second on the list. Schulz, who died in 2000, had posthumous earnings last year of $33 million, the magazine reported. He owes his constant presence to a steady revenue stream from the ongoing licensing of his characters, the magazine said. Schulz and Presley join Theodor \"Dr. Seuss\" Geisel (this year's No. 6), Beatles legend John Lennon (No. 7) and actress Marilyn Monroe (No. 9) as the only entertainers to make the list every year since its inception. Physicist Albert Einstein, best known for his theory of relativity, is fourth on the list. It is his third consecutive year making the Forbes rankings. Though he died in 1955, a franchise bearing his name -- Baby Einstein -- made big bucks last year selling educational books, DVDs, CDs, toys and other products. It plans to expand into the young-adult market this year. Australian actor Heath Ledger, who died of an overdose in January, made his debut on the list in third place. The magazine estimated his earnings at $20 million, thanks to the success of the movie, \"The Dark Knight,\" in which Ledger played the Joker. The movie grossed $991 million worldwide. Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer last month, also made his first appearance on the list, raking in $5 million. \"His income still largely stems from residuals from his classic pictures, as well as more recent productions,\" the magazine said. The legendary actor's line of natural and organic food products, Newman's Own, earned revenues of $120 million last year, but the earnings were not considered in the tally because Newman donated all profits to charity while he was living, the magazine said. Several entertainers from last year's list failed to make this year's cut, including composer, producer and Beatles guitarist George Harrison, rapper/actor Tupac Shakur, \"Godfather of Soul\" James Brown, and reggae legend Bob Marley.", "d3ff3a09512d524c67e3997b5b0675d6191f4927": "(Travel + Leisure) -- China can seem as impenetrable as it is imposing. Consider the numbers: it's the world's most populous nation (1.3 billion), where more than 100 cities have populations over a million. Fifty-six ethnic groups are spread across 22 wildly distinct provinces and five autonomous regions, in a landmass slightly larger than the U.S. The Tiananmen Gate at the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing . Its history seems limitless and its traditions just as deep. But here and now, change is the only real constant -- and it is accelerating at a dizzying pace. (One thousand new cars hit the streets of Beijing every day.) How do you begin to fathom a country of such extremes? The futuristic cities glittering above timeworn villages; the great rivers and vast empty deserts; the radical new architecture juxtaposed with millennia-old monuments; the ceaseless push-and-pull between Confucianism, Communism, and commerce. Where do you even begin? Have no fear. Start here with Travel + Leisure's suggestions for where to go and what to see. Beijing: 2--3 days . China's political, historical and cultural capital demands at least three days -- for the familiar landmarks of Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, and also for Beijing's 21st-century architecture, such as the \"Bird's Nest\" Olympic National Stadium by Herzog & de Meuron and the glass-and-titanium dome that is the National Grand Theater. China's contemporary art scene finds its nexus in the galleries and caf\u00e9s of the Dashanzi Art District, home to the new Ullens Center for Contemporary Art. Travel+Leisure.com: Tips for flying to China . Beijing's atmospheric hutong, or traditional alleyways, are fast disappearing; explore the bustling ones off Nanluoguxiang, near the 13th-century Drum and Bell towers. Then check out the Legation Quarter, a high-end restaurant, entertainment and cultural development set within the former American Embassy compound. And save a morning to stroll the manicured, 660-acre grounds of the Temple of Heaven, site of the circular Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, the 15th-century apogee of Chinese ritual architecture. Travel+Leisure.com: Chinese taxi trips . The Great Wall . Numerous stretches of the Great Wall are easily accessible from Beijing (ask your hotel to arrange a car or bus tour). But avoid the tourist trap of Badaling and head to the slightly less trammeled Mutianyu section, a 90-minute drive northeast of the Forbidden City. Early morning is best; try Asia 1 on 1 for day trips. Travel+Leisure.com: Where to stay in China . Shanghai: 2--3 days . First stop: the riverfront promenade known as the Bund, with its Art Deco, Neoclassical, and Beaux-Arts fa\u00e7ades, bars and shops, and views of the space-age towers of Pudong. In People's Park you'll find the Shanghai Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art. Weekdays are the best time to wander among the pine trees and ponds of the 16th-century Yuyuan Gardens. Xintiandi was the birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party; now this restored two-block district is defined by upscale shops and restaurants. The leafy, rustic French Concession is the favored destination for cutting-edge fashion and designs for the home. Shanghai's latest secret? Lane 248, a gritty, narrow street now inhabited by artsy caf\u00e9s and intimate boutiques, hidden behind Taikang Road. Travel+Leisure.com: China shopping tips and strategies . Guilin: 2 days . (Two hours by air from Shanghai.) With its sheer limestone peaks jutting up from the Li River, Guilin is straight out of a traditional Chinese landscape painting, and remains one of China's most breathtaking sights. Take in the view from Solitary Beauty Peak and marvel at the formations of the Reed Flute Cave. Spring and fall are best; avoid the heat of July and the crowds of the holiday seasons. Xi'an: 2 days . (Two hours by air from Beijing.) China's ancestral capital is renowned for its \"terra-cotta army,\" created during the Qin dynasty (221--207 B.C.): thousands of life-size clay warriors stand in formation as part of the funerary complex of China's first emperor, with much more yet to be excavated. You'll need at least two days here to take in the warriors, see the Shang dynasty bronze relics at the Shaanxi History Museum, walk along the Old City walls, and visit the Da Mai market. Datong: 2 days . (One hour by air or six hours by scenic train ride from Beijing.) Majestic Qing dynasty frescoes are the standout in the celebrated temple district. Nearby excursions include the awesome Buddhist sculptures in the Yungang Grottoes and the Hanging Temple of Mount Hengshan, which clings precipitously to the side of a cliff. Not far away are some especially beautiful eroded mud-brick ruins of the Great Wall. Hangzhou: 2 days . (Two hours by bullet train from Shanghai.) Fabled West Lake is the major draw here, with its elegant causeways, pavilions, gardens, and arched bridges. Hangzhou is also renowned as a culinary capital: local specialties include stuffed-beggar's chicken and fatty dongpo pork; sample both at the great Louwailou restaurant. Travel+Leisure.com: Must-try Chinese food . Suzhou: 1 day . (45 minutes by train from Shanghai.) Famous for its Ming- and Qing-dynasty gardens (don't miss the Garden of the Master of the Nets and the Humble Administrator's Garden), Suzhou was once called the Venice of the East for its canals. But smart travelers know the most picturesque waterways -- fringed by whitewashed houses and 1,000-year-old humpbacked bridges -- are in the village of Tongli, a 50-minute drive away. Kunming: 1 day . (Three hours by air from Shanghai.) This city is one of China's most pleasant, in climate-blessed Yunnan province. Visit the 15th-century Bamboo Temple and the 17th-century Golden Temple, stroll the pavilions and bridges of Green Lake, and savor the raucous energy of the Kundu Night Market. Dali: 1 day . (45 minutes by air from Kunming.) Like nearby Lijiang, Dali has a strong ethnic-minority flavor, a walled Old City with cobblestoned streets, and striking mountain scenery -- but without the same tourist mobs. Explore on foot, peek at the Three Pagodas, or go for a boat ride on Erhai Lake. Taiyuan: 1 day . (One hour by air from Beijing.) The capital of Shanxi province, Taiyuan is home to the Shanxi Provincial Museum, offering a superb survey of the region's 5,000-year history, and the Jinci Temple weaves a thread between Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism. And 90 minutes southwest by car is Pingyao, a stunningly preserved walled city and veritable time machine that carries you back to the Ming and Qing dynasties. Planning a beach getaway?

A Cessna Caravan 208 carrying 14 people was en route from Aurora to El Estor when the pilot started making distress calls about engine failure about 45 minutes after takeoff, said Jose Carlos, Guatemala's director of civil aeronautics. The air traffic tower in Guatemala City lost communication with the plane at 9:45 a.m. The plane crashed in Zacapa, an agricultural hub about 115 kilometers (71 miles) east of Guatemala City, killing the pilot Monica Bonilla, co-pilot Luis Fernando LanFiesta and the Americans. Four other passengers were injured and taken to a local hospital. \"It seems like the pilot tried her best to make a safe landing in a open field, but was not successful,\" said Ricardo Lemus, a Zacapa firefighter at the scene of the crash told reporters. \"On impact, the aircraft was split into pieces.\" The charter flight was operated by Aero Ruta Maya.", "637fb45545c2867cb5e54463ee3f332b24133649": "(CNN) -- The credit crisis has transformed the global financial landscape, bankrupting established names and prompting unprecedented interventions by governments and central banks to save others from collapse as they buckle under the weight of \"toxic debts.\"  This timeline charts the key moments in that process. 2007 Feb. 7: HSBC announces losses linked to U.S. subprime mortgages.

President Bush, who supports the deal, meets with India Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last week. Sen. Chris Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said the deal would not only \"set the stage for a stronger U.S.-India relationship,\" but also would promote stability in India's troubled neighborhood. \"This agreement is indicative of a new era in Indian foreign policy, an era in which India will see all the world's powers as potential partners in efforts to address its own needs and the needs of others,\" Dodd said. \"I believe that this new era will bring increased stability and progress in South Asia.\" India and Pakistan have fought several wars since they became independent in 1947, and both countries have tested nuclear weapons. Wednesday's vote was 86-13. Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, spoke against what he called flawed legislation before the vote. \"If we pass this legislation, we will reward India for flouting the most important arms control agreement in history, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and we will gravely undermine our case against hostile nations that seek to do the same,\" Harkin said. Before he voted against the bill, he said Congress had not debated the legislation properly. \"It was hustled through [the House of Representatives] without any hearings and without a vote in the House Foreign Affairs Committee,\" he said. \"Here in the Senate, the Foreign Relations Committee held just one hearing with just one witness who spoke in support of the agreement.\" Presidential candidates Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain voted for the bill. President Bush urged the Senate to pass the bill in a statement released before the vote. The bill \"represents a major milestone in the transformation of our nation's important relationship with India,\" the statement said. One senator had anonymously been using parliamentary rules to prevent the bill from coming to a vote, but the leaders of the Senate announced Tuesday night the vote would go ahead. The House of Representatives passed the bill without debate on Saturday. The next step is for Bush to sign it into law. The Indian nuclear market is a rich prize, and the agreement could open the way for U.S. companies to earn billions of dollars building nuclear power plants in India. The French government clinched its own nuclear trade deal with India on Wednesday when President Nicolas Sarkozy signed an agreement in Paris. That puts French companies in the running for some of the same contracts U.S. companies want. In exchange for access to U.S. nuclear technology, India would allow international inspections of its civilian -- but not military -- nuclear power plants. It would also promise not to resume testing of nuclear weapons. The United States banned nuclear trade with India after India exploded a nuclear device in 1974 and refused to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In an informal agreement between the two nations, the United States said it would halt any nuclear cooperation should India resume testing.", "941f9ba5091a41a41338a0b5c06ef998ab76bf92": "(CNN) -- While Sen. Barack Obama says he'll visit Iraq and Afghanistan before the election, he's staying consistent with his plans to start withdrawing U.S. troops almost immediately should he become president. Sen. Barack Obama says he'll go to Iraq and Afghanistan before November. Obama says the need to withdraw troops is twofold: . \"One is to spur more action out of the Iraqis. ... But the second reason for withdrawal is the fact that we're spending $10 [billion] to $12 billion a month in Iraq,\" Obama said Monday while on a two-day swing through Michigan. \"The people here in Flint, Michigan, who I'm going to be talking to, would like to see some of that investment made here at home.\" Obama also expressed concern that the Bush administration would rush to make some sort of status of forces agreement that would be binding to the next administration. The war in Iraq is a key issue for voters in the United States, and Obama and Sen. John McCain offer vastly different solutions for how to handle it. Obama supports a phased withdrawal of troops. He says he'd remove all combat brigades from Iraq within 16 months of taking office if he becomes president. McCain does not think American troops should return to the United States until Iraqi forces are capable of maintaining a safe, democratic state. He has been a strong advocate of the \"surge\" -- the 2007 escalation of U.S. troops -- and says troops should stay in Iraq as long as needed. McCain says Obama is wrong for opposing the increased troop presence, and Obama says McCain's judgment is flawed. Obama spoke Monday with Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari and told him he looked forward to seeing him in Baghdad before November. He also said he planned to visit Afghanistan before the election.  Watch Obama say he's going to Iraq \u00bb . \"I emphasized to him how encouraged I was by the reductions in violence in Iraq, but also insisted that it is important for us to begin the process of withdrawing U.S. troops, making clear that we have no interest in permanent bases in Iraq,\" Obama said. \"I gave [Zebari] an assurance that should we be elected, an Obama administration will make sure that we continue with the progress that's been made in Iraq, that we won't act precipitously,\" he said. Obama said Zebari did not express concern about a withdrawal of American troops, saying, \"He did emphasize his belief that we've made real progress and, I think, was eager to see political accommodations between the factions follow up in the wake of this progress.\" About the same time Obama was speaking to his traveling press corps, McCain told reporters at a press conference at his Arlington, Virginia, headquarters that Obama \"is now is closing in on his 900th day since he visited Iraq.\" The Republican National Committee has a counter on its Web site that clocks the time since Obama's last visit to the country. \"The whole debate in this campaign should be about whether we're going to allow that surge to continue to succeed or we're again going to do what Sen. Obama wanted to do, and that is to set a date for withdrawal long ago without giving the surge a chance to succeed,\" said McCain, again criticizing Obama for not meeting directly with Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq. \"I don't know how you can draw conclusions such as Sen. Obama has without even sitting down and talking with our commander on the ground,\" he added. McCain sat down with the visiting foreign minister one day before Obama.  Watch McCain talk with Zebari \u00bb . The senator from Arizona said they had a \"very good discussion about the challenges that have been overcome and the challenges that lay ahead,\" and he said there is \"no doubt\" that the surge has succeeded. There have been recent improvements in Iraq, where there are more than 150,000 U.S. troops. The number of deaths of U.S. troops there was at a five-year low last month, and Zebari said Saturday that the country has the lowest level of violence in the past four years. Military experts and Brookings analysts Michael O'Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack triggered criticism last year when they returned from Iraq and argued that things were not as bad as they had seemed.  Watch experts weigh in on Iraq \u00bb . \"I do think that there was a sense among the Democratic Party that the war, and the failure of the war, was going to be a major election issue for them that they could use against the Republicans,\" Pollack said Sunday on CNN. \"And so, when you had two Democrats coming back and saying, 'Look, there actually is progress there. This thing is not completely lost, and we ought to give it some more time' -- which is effectively all we were saying -- I think that this was a bombshell, because it wasn't what people had heard before.\" O'Hanlon said Sunday that they've seen continued progress, especially in the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces. He said Democrats are not rethinking their Iraq policy because, for many of them, \"this is the symbol of the Bush administration's failed foreign policy.\" \"This became the symbol of Bush administration arrogance and unilateralism. And then, for four years it went badly. So, given that backdrop, it's pretty hard for Democrats to come around to the idea that perhaps, by Bush finally letting professionals run this war instead of ideologues, that we have begun to rescue this situation. I think that's the simplest interpretation.\" CNN's Alexander Marquardt and Chris Welch contributed to this report.", "f4aefbd80d7ef7405e0a5bff75bb3e6c07565bf5": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The House of Representatives on Tuesday night passed an energy bill clearing the way for more oil drilling off U.S. coasts, but not nearly as much as Republican leaders wanted. The bill was passed by a vote of 236-189. Many Republicans opposed the bill because it would allow new oil drilling only between 50 and 100 miles offshore. Republicans generally want to allow new drilling starting 3 miles from shore. Republicans also objected to provisions repealing tax cuts for the oil industry and what they said was a lack of incentive for states to allow drilling on their land. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, told reporters Tuesday: \"The American taxpayers have been ripped off for years on offshore drilling. This bill changes that.\" Before the vote, Pelosi said the bill presented a choice between \"the status quo, which is preferred by Big Oil,\" and \"change for the future to take our country in a new direction.\" Fifteen Republicans voted for the largely Democrat-backed bill. Thirteen Democrats voted against it. The Senate, meanwhile, could vote on various energy proposals, including more offshore drilling, as early as this week. The House bill would require states to give their permission for drilling on their land. It also would offer incentives for renewable energy, require the government to release oil from its emergency reserve, and force oil companies to drill on federal lands they already lease from the government. Democratic leaders had previously opposed Republican-led efforts to repeal a 1981 law barring most offshore drilling. But they changed course over the August recess, saying their new plans would allow some expanded drilling.  See where U.S. offshore drilling is banned \u00bb . But Republicans say the House bill wouldn't expand offshore drilling enough. Before the vote, Rep. Mike Pence, an Indiana Republican, called the bill \"a charade,\" denying it would do what its backers claim. \"This is not 'yes' to drilling. This is 'yes, but,' \" he said. \"This is 'yes, but no drilling in Alaska, no drilling in the Eastern Gulf, no drilling inside 50 miles,' \" Pence said. \"This is 'yes, but no litigation reform that will prevent radical environmental attorneys from tying up leases even before a single shovel of dirt is turned.' \" Democrats and Republicans traded harsh words on the House floor Tuesday in the debate over the bill. Rep. Anthony Weiner, a New York Democrat, said President Bush's \"idea of an energy policy is holding hands with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, embracing him with a big smooch.\" When the Republicans \"controlled Congress, [they] passed their own energy bill, signed into law by the president. We got into this mess,\" Weiner said. But Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, shot back that the Democrats' bill is a \"sham\" and a \"fraud.\" \"This is a bill designed to ensure Democrats' re-election, not designed to ensure affordable energy in America,\" Hensarling said. Hensarling also complained about how the bill was brought to the floor: \"No amendments, no substitutes, no committee hearings. Is this democracy? No.\"", "d836cfc526a2808fc7e37d04fa11bdb8efdfd221": "BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- The Chinese women's gymnastics team did not use underage competitors during this year's Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, the International Gymnastics Federation said Wednesday. Widespread reports claimed that gold medal winner  He Kexin was only 14 years old. The federation said it has concluded its inquiry into the matter after it confirmed the gymnasts' ages through official documents that the Chinese Gymnasts Association provided. The documents included passports, identity cards and household registers. However, the organization intends to further investigate the ages of two gymnasts, Dong Fangxiao and Yang Yun, who participated in the 2000 summer games in Sydney, Australia. The federation said it did not consider  the explanations and evidence that Chinese authorities provided in regard to those athletes as satisfactory. The International Olympic Committee had asked gymnastics officials to clarify the situation after numerous commentators, bloggers and others questioned whether about half the members of China's team were old enough to compete.  Watch tiny gymnasts work out \u00bb . Athletes must be at least 16 in the year the games take place. In women's gymnastics, younger girls can have an advantage over older competitors on account of their often smaller, lighter and more agile bodies. The Chinese women's gymnastics team won a gold medal in a team competition at the Beijing games, and five members won individual medals. One of the challenges came from a blogger known as \"Stryde Hax.\" The blogger claimed to have uncovered proof that Chinese gymnast He Kexin is only 14. In Internet searches, \"Stryde Hax\" allegedly uncovered Web pages showing lists complied by China's General Administration of Sport that show a 1994 date of birth for He. CNN was not been able to independently verify the information, but snapshots of the Web pages appeared to back up the claim. Other bloggers joined the search and reported similar results. The New York Times conducted its own investigation, producing similar results that seem to implicate He and two other members of the team. The Times uncovered a 2006 biography on He that lists her birthday as January 1, 1994. The International Gymnastics Federation, however, has said that those gymnasts were eligible and that the ages on their passports were correct. Chinese gymnastics coaches also defended their team. \"Asians have different figures than people from the West, so that's what caused their suspicion,\" said Huang Yubin, head coach of the men's and women's teams, referring to media inquiries. \"They shouldn't be suspicious.\"", "707b68175a98d495a9638577457bc8832decffe7": "(CNN) -- British police were told in March this year that missing girl Madeleine McCann may have been kidnapped by a pedophile ring which followed her three days before her abduction, according to reports. Madeleine McCann went missing in May 2007 after being left at a holiday apartment in the Algarve region. Britain's Daily Telegraph and The Sun newspapers both reported Thursday that an email released this week as part of the documents compiled by the Portuguese investigators probing Madeleine's disappearance revealed the connection to the ring. Madeleine was 3 when she disappeared May 3, 2007, while she was on holiday with her family at the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz. Her disappearance prompted headlines worldwide. According to the newspapers, the email was sent on March 4 by a London-based Metropolitan Police intelligence officer to Leicestershire police -- Madeleine's home county -- who then forwarded it on to investigators in Portugal more than a month later. In the email, which both newspapers printed a copy of, the officer writes that \"intelligence suggests that a pedophile ring in Belgium made an order for a young girl three days before Madeleine McCann was taken. \"Somebody connected to this group saw Maddie, took a photograph of her and sent it to Belgium. The purchaser agreed the girl was suitable and Maddie was taken,\" the officer wrote. The Daily Telegraph reported the Portuguese police then asked Interpol to investigate. However, nothing appears to have come of the lead.  Watch how Madeleine McCann may have been abducted to order \u00bb . Belgium has already featured in the case, with a reported sighting on the Dutch/Belgian border last August already discounted. The case files, released by the Portuguese investigators this week after they shelved the investigation for lack of evidence last month, have provided a raft of leads for the media to report. On Tuesday, the documents revealed a previously undisclosed sighting of Madeleine in the Netherlands shortly after her disappearance. The possible sighting of Madeleine in May 2007 stemmed from a report by a Dutch shopkeeper, who told authorities she encountered a little girl in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. She said the child identified herself as Maddie and said she was taken from her mother while on holiday. \"I start to ask where her mommy was,\" Anna Stam said. \"She couldn't tell me that. I wanted to give her a balloon, but she didn't want that. She only wants her mommy, she said. And she said that these people took her from her mommy.\" At one point, authorities had named the girl's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, as \"arguidos,\" or suspects, along with a British man living in Portugal, Robert Murat. But a spokesman for the Portuguese public prosecutor's office said authorities found no evidence of involvement by any of the three and were no longer considering them \"arguidos.\" After closing the case, police turned their case file -- containing up to 30,000 pages -- over to attorneys and private investigators working for the McCanns. The McCanns have vowed to keep searching for their daughter. .", "c319070b5ca849570737f86a8fa38703a4517433": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A neighborhood in east London was getting back to normal Saturday after British Army engineers detonated a large World War II bomb unearthed this week on a building site, officials said. Army engineers covered the bomb with sand to minimise the risk of an explosion. An Army bomb disposal team carried out a controlled explosion on the 2,200-pound German warhead at 5:55 p.m. (12:55 p.m. ET) Friday, London's Metropolitan Police said. Video of the blast showed brown dirt, debris and black smoke shooting into the air when the bomb went off. There were no reports of any injuries or damage to surrounding property after the blast, the police and Ministry of Defense said. The public was allowed back into the industrial neighborhood by Friday night, authorities said. Two subway lines and a rail line in the area, which were shut down after construction crews discovered the bomb Monday, were running normal service Saturday, transportation officials said. London's transit authority, Transport for London (TfL), said the police and army gave permission for its engineers to check the tracks less than an hour after the controlled explosion. The tracks were clear of debris and damage and services resumed at 7:13 p.m. (2:13 p.m. ET), TfL said. Contractors preparing a waterway near the site of the future Olympic Park discovered the bomb Monday. The Ministry of Defense said the bomb, which measured four feet by two feet, was the largest one found in the capital since 1975. The bomb was \"enormous,\" said Simon Saunders, a spokesman for the British Army's London district. At one point during the week the bomb started ticking, which suggested a timing device, Saunders said. Disposal experts put strong magnets next to the bomb to shut down the clockwork and the ticking stopped, he said. It's not uncommon for World War II-era bombs to be unearthed in Europe. In London, which suffered the aerial bombardment of the Blitz, bombs are uncovered two or three times a year, Saunders said. The London Blitz lasted from September 1940 until May 1941. German bombers attacked the city every day or night for the first two months, but the worst night was the last -- May 10, 1941, when 3,000 people were killed in London, according to the Museum of London. Much of the Blitz focused on east London. In all, more than 20,000 people were killed in the Blitz, short for \"Blitzkrieg,\" the German word for \"lightning war.\"", "bd29f269b97d8a5bc0c4d2accf62b790e4f92364": "(CNN Student News) -- Record the CNN Special Investigations Unit Classroom Edition: Notes from North Korea when it airs commercial-free on CNN.

Glenn Beck says the decisions Washington makes today could have fateful consequences for the future. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Dear America: . Happy 300th Birthday! It's 2076 and we've just invented the time-fax machine. (Actually, \"we\" didn't invent the time-fax machine, the State did -- they pretty much control everything now.) I'm faxing this back to you in 2008 because that seems to be the year we had the best chance to reverse our course and get back to the vision laid out by our founding fathers -- a vision that didn't include the government being in the insurance business. I don't have a lot of time (the State only gives us one 30-minute break per day) so let me give you some advice: Stop worrying so much about who runs the country and start worrying about who runs your towns, your states, and your Congress. I know you're all distracted by the presidential election, but for all the money and time poured into it, the truth is that you're choosing between two roads that will lead you to the same destination. Sure, one may be the Autobahn and the other a two-lane highway, but you'll end up at the same place either way. Decades of Republicans and Democrats alike have all chipped in to lead you to where you are today. Believing that one person, from either party, can change that by themselves is a big mistake. Presidents are like captains of a large ship: They can map out a course and shout out orders, but without the trust and hard work of the people who actually move the rudders, their commands mean nothing. In retrospect, the lack of trust and confidence you now have in your leaders was really the root cause of everything that's happened since. While our founding fathers designed a brilliant system of checks and balances, separation of powers and democratic elections, trust was the one thing they couldn't mandate in the Constitution. Unfortunately, it's also the foundation upon which everything else is built and once it began to erode, our whole house inevitably began to crumble. Looking back now, it's pretty obvious that our trust in government declined at about the same rate as our partisanship increased. People became so concerned about getting their party into power at any cost that the truth didn't even seem to matter anymore. That's probably one of the reasons why George Washington hated the idea of political parties so much. Here's what he said about them in his 1796 farewell speech: . \"The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty.\" I know that George had a habit for using big words, so allow me to translate into 2008 English: Political parties that put their own success over that of the country's will be the death of America. If you don't believe him yet, just wait a few more years...you're about to see firsthand how right he was. After all, if power corrupts, then the kind of absolute power gained by political parties (and feared by Washington) corrupts absolutely. The best advice I can give you is to stop thinking in terms of left and right and start thinking in terms of right and wrong. Demand the best leaders possible, and then demand the best out of them. Believe me, when you see what's coming your way, you'll realize how little the donkey and the elephant really ever mattered. Oh and while we're on politics, one quick thing that I'm sure you're curious about: Yes, Robert Byrd is still in the Senate. He's 159, but doesn't look a day over 91. Now, let's talk about the economy. Let me see if I have this right: Money and power made people greedy, so you decided to hand over a bunch of money and power to greedy politicians instead. Smart! After using that money to nationalize a bunch of banks, mortgage companies and insurance companies, they moved on to bigger things. The airlines came first -- we just couldn't live without them. Then it was the automakers (Detroit would've died), health care (they said they could manage it better), and eventually, the oil companies (I'm not sure where all of those \"windfall profits\" have gone). The idea behind it all (an idea that was eventually turned into law with the passage of the Securities Exchange Act of 2011) was to \"socialize losses\" by spreading them out among all taxpayers. The pain, our leaders argued, would be minimal that way. They were right. At least until the bills came due. See, we didn't actually have any of the money we were promising everyone; we were borrowing it. It didn't take long before so many of our tax dollars were going toward interest payments that we couldn't fund even the most basic of government programs without massive tax increases on everyone. People now work most of the year just to pay Uncle Sam (or, as we now call him, \"Comrade Sam\"). I hear the State censors coming, so let me leave you with a few other quick things: . \u2022 Good call on not worrying about protecting our borders. That works out really well for you in 2019. \u2022 You might want to spend a little less time worrying about carbon and a little more time worrying about Iran. We're now in a new mini-Ice Age but, believe me, Iran isn't using their nukes to warm any homes. (PS The International Atomic Energy Agency just revealed to you that Iran appears to be refitting their long-range missiles to carry nuclear payloads. Did you think they were joking or were you just too busy with lipsticks and pigs to notice?) \u2022 The currency of the future is energy. Those who have it are thriving and those who don't -- well, let's just leave it at that. Drill for all the oil you can, but you also better start seriously looking for some other options. In closing, remember this golden rule and you should be fine: Your Constitution will never fail you, but your leaders will. Be wary of anyone who tries to convince you that it's the other way around. Best wishes (you're going to need them), . Worker 2744A . PS It's not all socialist doom and gloom here in the future.

Tyler Peterson, a sheriff's deputy, shot and killed six people, police said. Initial reports that 20-year-old Tyler Peterson was killed by a police sniper's bullet were apparently incorrect, though it appears the sniper may have shot Peterson in the arm, Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen said. Although the final forensic determination could take several weeks, the attorney general said that Peterson had his personal .40-caliber Glock when police found him. The three gunshots to the head came from a .40-caliber. \"The three gunshot wounds to the head included two nonfatal rounds with entry points below the chin, and one fatal shot that entered Peterson through the right side of the head,\" Van Hollen said. \"Each of the three head shots were fired while the gun was in contact with his skin, or extremely close to the skin,\" he said. \"These three head wounds are consistent with self-inflicted wounds, and not consistent with long-range rifle fire.\" The fourth gunshot wound, Van Hollen said, struck Peterson in the left bicep and appeared to have been fired from a rifle \"at some distance.\"  Watch Van Hollen explain the shootings \"will never make sense\" \u00bb . Peterson was a Forest County sheriff's deputy and a part-time officer with the Crandon Police Department. According to Van Hollen, Peterson, while off-duty shortly before 3 a.m. Sunday, entered a house where the seven young men and women had gathered. While there, Van Hollen said, Peterson apparently got into an argument with Jordanne Murray, accusing her of having a relationship with another person. \"The argument got heated, and Murray demanded he leave,\" the attorney general said. \"Peterson left, and returned minutes later,\" breaking down the door and opening fire with an AR-15 rifle, of the type he was issued by the Forest County Sheriff's Department. Police said Peterson fired about 30 rounds. Fewer than 20 minutes later, a patrolling Crandon police officer, after hearing gunfire, reported it and went to the house to investigate, Van Hollen said. The officer, Greg Carter, 21, reported seeing Peterson leave the house with a rifle. After momentarily losing sight of Peterson, Carter \"heard multiple rounds of gunfire\" and his windshield burst. Peterson escaped. Van Hollen said that Peterson apparently \"drove aimlessly around the northern part of the state\" for several hours, calling in false reports to police to throw them off. Peterson  ended up at a cabin in the town of Argonne shortly before 8 a.m. He told friends about the shootings, handed over the AR-15 and two other rifles and left the cabin. After meeting with family members, he returned to the cabin around 9:15 a.m. Police arrived about 15 minutes later, Van Hollen said. Peterson was killed during a police shootout after police couldn't persuade him to surrender. All seven victims were students or graduates of Crandon High School, from which Peterson also was a graduate. In addition to Murray, the dead were identified as Aaron Smith, Bradley Schultz, Lindsey Stahl, Lianna Thomas and Katrina McCorkle. The sole survivor, Charlie Neitzel, 21, \"played dead\" after Peterson shot him three times, Van Hollen said. After Peterson shot him once, Neitzel begged him to stop. But Peterson fired again. Neitzel fell to the floor, was shot a third time and didn't move. \"Playing dead until Peterson left, Neitzel survived,\" Van Hollen said. Neitzel was the last person shot. Neitzel underwent surgery Tuesday and was in stable condition Tuesday night, a hospital employee said. The families of the six slain young people asked that media leave them alone in their grief, Van Hollen told reporters. But the families of the victims also wanted it known that they had met with Peterson's family. \"They hold no animosity toward them,\" Van Hollen said, conveying the families' wishes that the Peterson family be allowed space and time to heal.

John McCain's campaign accused Obama and Democrats of putting \"politics ahead of country.\" The House of Representatives rejected a $700 billion plan to bail out the financial system, putting a roadblock in front of the largest government intervention in the market since the Great Depression. The bill failed by a vote of 205 to 228, with 140 Democrats and 65 Republicans voting in favor and 95 Democrats joining 133 Republicans against. \"This is a moment of national crisis, and today's inaction in Congress as well as the angry and hyper-partisan statement released by the McCain campaign are exactly why the American people are disgusted with Washington,\" the Obama-Biden campaign said in a statement released shortly after the vote. The statement went on to say that every American \"should be outraged that an era of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street and Washington has led us to this point.\"  Watch more on the vote \u00bb . Also after the vote, McCain touted his role in last week's negotiations on the bailout bill. \"I laid out principles\" including \"responsible oversight,\" transparency and a cap on so-called golden parachutes --the big bonuses Wall Street CEOs would receive despite their involvement in the economic crisis, he said from Des Moines, Iowa. \"I worked hard to play a constructive role.\" He said he was satisfied with the way the bill was written, though \"it wasn't perfect.\" Earlier, McCain's campaign accused Obama and Democrats of injecting politics into the American economy. \"From the minute John McCain suspended his campaign and arrived in Washington to address this crisis, he was attacked by the Democratic leadership: Sens. Obama and [Senate Majority Leader Harry] Reid, Speaker Pelosi and others. \"Their partisan attacks were an effort to gain political advantage during a national economic crisis. By doing so, they put at risk the homes, livelihoods and savings of millions of American families,\" Doug Holtz-Eakin, a senior policy adviser for McCain and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, said in a statement. \"Barack Obama failed to lead, phoned it in, attacked John McCain and refused to even say if he supported the final bill. ... This bill failed because Barack Obama and the Democrats put politics ahead of country,\" Holtz-Eakin said. Republicans and Democrats blamed each other for the failure of the bill, which President Bush had urged Congress to approve. Obama had earlier Monday spoken with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and congressional leaders.  Watch Pelosi say Democrats 'delivered' \u00bb . McCain and Obama had both said Sunday that they would probably vote for the legislation, as long as it included some key principles they had pushed for. McCain announced last week he was \"suspending\" his campaign events to focus on the financial crisis, but Democrats accused him of pulling a political stunt. iReport.com: Do you support a Wall Street bailout? The economy has dominated the campaign trail this month, and both candidates have been trying to convince voters that they will do a better job of getting the financial crisis under control. Earlier Monday, McCain told voters that Obama isn't being honest about his tax votes and said the Democrat is \"always cheering for higher taxes.\" iReport.com: Share your stories from the campaign trail . In response, the Obama campaign called McCain's remarks \"false attacks\" and an \"angry diatribe.\" \"Two times, on March 14, 2008, and June 4, 2008, in the Democratic budget resolution, he voted to raise taxes on people making just $42,000 per year. He even said at the time that this vote for higher taxes on the middle class was 'getting our nation's priorities back on track,' \" McCain said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio. \"Then something amazing happened: On Friday night, he looked the American people in the eye and said it never happened. My friends, we need a president who will always tell the American people the truth,\" McCain said. McCain said a vote for Obama would \"guarantee higher taxes, fewer jobs and an even bigger federal government\" and charged that \"these policies will deepen our recession.\"  Watch McCain slam Obama on spending \u00bb . Shortly after McCain finished his speech, the Obama campaign accused the Arizona senator of lying. \"Sen. McCain's angry diatribe today won't make up for his erratic response to the greatest financial crisis of our time. John McCain knows that the budget he's talking about didn't end up raising taxes on a single American, and the lie he told the American people today is all the more outrageous a day after he admitted that his health care plan will increase taxes on some families,\" Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor said. In McCain's speech, the Republican presidential candidate was referring to votes on a resolution (Senate Concurrent Resolution 70) meant to outline the Senate's budget priorities through 2013, but the measure had no practical effect. According to a CNN review of the resolution, it assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts pushed by President Bush will expire in that time, which McCain says amounts to a tax increase. Obama and his running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, voted \"yes\" on the resolution. McCain did not vote. However, the Democrats offered their own cuts in the 48-page resolution, which called for several tax cuts and breaks, including rolling back the alternative-minimum tax and the so-called \"marriage penalty.\" According to an analysis by the independent Tax Policy Center, the tax plan Obama has proposed during the campaign would increase taxes in 2009 on the wealthiest 20 percent of households, while offering tax cuts for the other 80 percent. Meanwhile, as Obama and McCain continue campaigning this week, their running mates will be focused on their upcoming debate. Palin and Biden face off Thursday in St. Louis, Missouri, in the only vice presidential debate of the election season. After McCain's rally, Palin headed to McCain's ranch near Sedona, Arizona, for what a top aide calls \"debate camp.\" Palin has already spent four days hunkered down in a Philadelphia hotel for debate prep with advisers.

Kashmiris watch as Indian trucks cross into the border town of Chakothi in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. To cheers and band music, the first trucks rumbled from the Pakistani side across a white bridge to a brightly decorated trade center festooned . Apple-laden Indian trucks heading the other way were also warmly welcomed. It is hoped the move will ease tensions in the troubled Himalayan region, which has been a conflict flashpoint between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan who both lay claims to the territory. \"Today, we have regained our lost market,\" said Ghulam Rasool Bhat, president of the Kashmir fruit growers' association.  Watch more about the historic day \u00bb . \"We are sending the sweet Kashmir apple as the first consignment. This is sure to sweeten the relation between the two neighbors. The beginning of the trade between the two Kashmirs will further improve the relations and lead to a peaceful resolution of the bitter problem,\" he said. The trucks were subjected to thorough security checks before they crossed the bridge, one of the few crossing points in the heavily militarized 742-kilometer (460-mile) Line of Control, the de facto frontier that divides the region. Kashmir has been a major source of dispute between India, and Pakistan since the two countries were partitioned at the end of British rule in 1947. Muslim Kashmiris sided with Pakistan to the north, while the Hindu south joined India. For the past 18 years, Kashmir has been wracked by a bloody separatist campaign. Authorities say up to 43,000 people have died, but rights groups and non-governmental organizations put the death toll at twice that. Violence had dropped off since the countries began a peace process in 2004, but it surged after the state government in Indian-controlled Kashmir announced plans in June to donate land for a Hindu shrine. Muslim protests following the decision prompted a government U-turn that triggered Hindu demonstrations calling for it to be restored. Subsequent violence left 40 dead and hundreds wounded. It is hoped Tuesday's route opening will bolster the peace agreement and combat lingering mistrust between India and Pakistan. A bilateral cease-fire has been holding in the region for more than four years. A bus service connecting the divided Kashmir began amid much fanfare in 2005 but struggled under the weight of elaborate security checks and stifling bureaucracy. \"This is a great emotional moment, as it brings to mind my grandfather, who used to drive lorries on this road,\" said Muzhar Hussain Naqvi, who drove the leading Pakistani truck.

At least 29 people were wounded when the bomber detonated her suicide vest in a marketplace in the Diyala province town of Qara Tappa, a predominantly Shiite Kurdish town with a Shiite Turkmen population. Col. Ragheb al-Omairi, spokesman for Diyala Military operations command, who confirmed the account, said police on foot patrols were also in the area of bombing. Twenty-five civilians and four police were wounded, with at least 12 of the civilians in critical condition. The match, which Iraq won 2-1, was watched avidly across the country by Iraqis of all stripes -- united by their love of soccer. The game was part of the Asian qualifier for the 2010 South Africa World Cup, and Iraq and China are part of Group 1, along with Australia and Qatar. The match was played in China. The top two teams in the round advance to another stage of qualifying for the World Cup. Iraq eliminated China from competition and is in the running to advance. Celebratory gunfire also rang out across Baghdad, and the Baghdad Operations Command put an urgent message on state TV asking people to be careful and avoid shooting to celebrate. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki issued congratulations to the team, which last year won the Asia Cup. The bombing underscored the tensions that persist in a country where violence has dropped. Twenty females have carried out suicide bombings in Iraq this year, many more than in previous years. According to the U.S. military, women carried out eight bombings in all of 2007. Authorities said that al Qaeda in Iraq is recruiting women and that more women are offering themselves up for missions. The officials said the women are desperate and hopeless, most have pre-existing ties to the insurgency, and their main motive is revenge for a male family member killed by U.S. or Iraqi forces in the war. \"We do see certain members of cells attempting to persuade women, specifically in many cases wives of those who have been killed as terrorists, to conduct suicide operations,\" U.S. Maj. Gen. Mark Hertling said recently. His area of operations includes Diyala province. Hertling's troops have targeted families of suspected female bombers in a bid to break up the rings that are recruiting the women and girls. Intelligence gathered from detainees indicates that al Qaeda in Iraq is looking for women who are illiterate, who are deeply religious or who have financial struggles, often because they've lost the male head of the household. Women and girls always have played a role in the insurgency in Iraq, helping feed militants, hiding them in their homes and helping to sneak weapons around the country. They have proved to be highly effective in their operations, because women are not searched by men for cultural and religious reasons. The U.S. military has created a program called the Daughters of Iraq, analogous to the Sons of Iraq, across the Sunni regions of the country. The Daughters of Iraq are being trained to conduct searches of women.

The statue of Kate Moss will be displayed in the British Museum in a gallery holding anicent Greek sculpture. Called \"Siren,\" the statue will be part of a group of major sculptures by leading British artists to go on display at the museum in October, the museum announced. The museum says the artist, Marc Quinn, claims it's the largest gold statue since ancient Egypt. His previous work included the marble sculpture Alison Lapper Pregnant, which appeared on a plinth in London's Trafalgar Square. The Kate Moss statue, weighing 50kg, will be displayed in a gallery of the museum that houses ancient Greek sculpture. The museum calls it a \"fitting setting\" for the statue of Moss, \"interacting with the great Greek beauties that surround it.\" Moss, whose slight frame was at the forefront of the waif look in the mid-1990s, is now nearly as well known for her celebrity lifestyle as her modeling career.

At 29, Jay Chou is already a household name in many Asian countries. \"I think I tend to believe in myself. I don't know....maybe I was born to believe in myself rather than in others. That's why I like to complete my work on my own,\" the solo singer-songwriter and actor told CNN's Talk Asia. The 29-year-old has ridden his wave of inner belief to become one of Asia's biggest pop stars, and fostered an image of being something of an anti-hero, neither boastful nor too brash. His music mixes ballads with urban R&B beats, while he has also taken a march on Asian cinema, writing his own screenplays, directing and appearing in a number of hit films. Music remains his first love, having found success despite being naturally shy. He released his first album in 2000, and eight years and seven albums later he still believes he has plenty of material for songs left in him, breaking from the usual Mando- and Canto-pop themes of boy-meets-girl. In the past his lyrics have ventured into more considered and darker territory with a song about an abusive father and have taken on a variety of themes and genres. \"I think my music is quite different from the Western rap music culture. You won't find bad language in my music. I have this sense of responsibility to add an educational element in my music. That's why I would never write anything about suicide or whatever, because I think we all need the courage to deal with our lives,\" he said. Chou was brought up by his mother, a school teacher in Linkou in Taiwan. His parents divorced while he was at a young age. He began playing the piano as a 3-year-old, continuing to practice daily throughout his school days where despite being a diligent pupil he was academically average. While a so-so student he developed a way to express himself by focusing on playing the piano, and from it developed a self-reliant streak. \"I think my confidence belongs to the stage or when I'm standing in front of the screen. I'm like two different people on-stage and off-stage,\" he told CNN's Talk Asia. Chou's career was given a boost when he was spotted by Taiwanese entertainer Jacky Wu while backstage before a TV talent contest. Wu liked what he saw and introduced Chou to the music industry, at first as a songwriter for others. \"I never aimed to be a pop icon or whatever. My first album was actually a collection of songs that I wrote for other people. They didn't want them, so I made the album myself. The only aim I had was to be a singer-songwriter, not an idol,\" said Chou. Despite modest beginnings then he has reached idol status in many Asian countries, having appeared in front of crowds of tens of thousands of people across Asia and on the silver screen to millions. His huge exposure also ensures he's the sources of constant speculation from the media about his private life. \"I think showbiz in Taiwan, or even in the Chinese-speaking region, is quite different from showbiz in the U.S. The more low-profile and tight-lipped you are, the more the paparazzi runs after you. And I happen to belong in this category,\" he said.", "407f1d56cdeccb0e313c15ddaac53b186acdbf0c": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- With moments of silence punctuated by somber music, readings of names, and tears, Americans held solemn memorial services Thursday to honor the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Russia's Tupolev TU-160, pictured here in 2003, is a long-range strategic bomber. The Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers landed at Venezuela's Libertador military airfield and \"will spend several days carrying out training flights over neutral waters, after which they will return to the base,\" Interfax reported, citing the Russian Defense Ministry. Col. Alexander Drobyshevsky, a ministry spokesman, told Interfax that NATO fighters followed the bombers on their 13-hour flight over the Arctic Ocean and the Atlantic. \"All flights by air force aircraft have been and are marked by strict conformity to the international rules on the use of air space over neutral waters,\" Drobyshevsky told Interfax. The U.S. will monitor the Russian training, said Pentagon officials who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the information. On Monday, Russia announced it might hold joint naval maneuvers with Venezuela in the Caribbean. The declaration came in the wake of increased tension between Russia and the United States over Russia's invasion last month of the former Soviet republic of Georgia, a U.S. ally that aspires to join NATO. Russia on Monday denied any link between that announcement and the conflict in Georgia, although Russia has criticized U.S. support for Georgia, and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has long antagonized Washington. Earlier this month, Chavez said Venezuela would welcome the Russian air force, according to Russian news agency Novosti. \"If Russian long-range bombers should need to land in Venezuela, we would not object to that either. We will also welcome them,\" Chavez said on September 1, according to Novosti.

An Israeli woman stands in front of posters of captured soldiers Sunday in Jerusalem. \"It's not an easy decision,\" Mark Regev told CNN. \"One of the people being released is a brutal murderer, a man that with his own hands killed infants -- a terrible crime, but this is a nasty business.\" He was referring to Samir Kuntar, the longest-serving Lebanese prisoner in Israel, who is hailed as a hero by Hezbollah. Kuntar was convicted for a 1979 attack in which he shot and killed an Israeli man in front of his 4-year-old daughter before smashing her head against a rock  and tossing her into the sea. The victim's 2-year-old daughter was accidentally smothered by her mother, who tried to keep her quiet as they hid from the attackers. Kuntar was convicted for murdering both children in the attack, which the Palestine Liberation Front orchestrated to protest the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty at Camp David the previous year. Kuntar is one of five Lebanese prisoners who Israel will release in exchange for two Israeli soldiers, Ehud \"Udi\" Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. The Lebanon-based Shiite militant group kindapped the two in a July 2006 raid into northern Israel that left three other Israeli soldiers dead. Hezbollah never gave Israel any indication whether they survived the attack, which sparked a 34-day war, leaving the families in limbo. Before the vote, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told his Cabinet that the two soldiers are not alive, \"as far as we know.\" \"We'll have a final answer when they are returned,\" Regev said. Goldwasser and Regev are at the center of the landmark agreement, which has been years in the making, with both sides using the prisoners and intelligence as bartering chips. Under the deal, which the Cabinet approved 22-3 on Sunday, Hezbollah will also release information about Ron Arad, an Israeli navigator who has been missing since he was forced to eject from his plane over Lebanon in October 1986. \"We have an obligation, a moral obligation to their families to bring finality,\" Regev said. \"That if they are in fact no longer living, that their families can have a funeral, that they can have a grave, that they can know that this is over.\" Israel has repeatedly attempted to get information about Arad and other missing airmen by using Lebanese detainees as leverage. Former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon promised the Arad family that Kuntar will not be released unless Hezbollah provides information on Arad. In addition to Kuntar and other Lebanese prisoners, Israel will also release Palestinian prisoners and return the remains of dozens of border infiltrators and eight Hezbollah members to Lebanon, according to a statement from the government. Israel will also provide information to the United Nations about four Iranian diplomats who disappeared in Beirut during the 1982 Israeli invasion, the statement said. Earlier this month, Israel deported a Lebanese-born man who served six years in jail on charges of spying for Hezbollah. In exchange, Hezbollah handed over a brown coffin containing the remains of Israeli soldiers killed during the 2006 war. The move was seen as a prelude to a possible prisoner swap between Israel and Hezbollah.

But when the family went to Blue Smoke restaurant Sunday afternoon in New York, someone had already asked to hold the peanuts. Ava Zinna ate an allergen-free meal at the Worry Free Dinners event on Sunday. The Zinnas took part in Worry Free Dinners, a series of monthly meals for people with food allergies. Sunday's 16-person barbecue -- complete with ribs, chicken, burgers and brownies -- was the first event aimed directly at parents and children affected by food allergies. \"When you're going into a restaurant environment, you're putting your child's safety and livelihood into other hands,\" Tara Zinna said. At the Worry Free Dinners event, \"not only was the food phenomenal, but it's wonderful to have an opportunity to interact with other families who are dealing with similar issues.\" The recent \"worry free\" meal event took place just days before the Food and Drug Administration's September 16 public hearing on food ingredient labels. Since 2006, food manufacturers have been required to clearly label products that contain any of the most common allergens -- milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat and soy -- but some allergy experts say the labels should be more explicit. Restaurant dining can be a terrifying experience for people with severe food allergies. When the meal arrives, there's often no way of knowing every single ingredient that went into it, or what else touched the plate and utensils used to serve it. You also have to pester the restaurant staff with special requests. But with Worry Free Dinners, everyone has some kind of experience with all of that, which helps build camaraderie, said Sloane Miller, who started organizing the events in April.  Read more tips on how to manage food allergies \u00bb . \"People sit down and start chatting immediately like they're old friends,\" said Miller, known in the blogosphere as \"Allergic Girl.\" \"It's so nice to be with people that you don't have to explain [to] why you want something on the side.\" So far, Worry Free Dinners has catered to food allergy sufferers in New York -- there are about 12 million in America, according to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) -- but Miller is looking to take the concept to other cities. A common but mysterious condition . One out of every 17 children under 3 years old in America has a food allergy, and some will outgrow their sensitivities, said Anne Munoz-Furlong, founder and CEO of FAAN. But allergies to peanuts, nuts, shellfish and fish tend to be lifelong, she said. As far as she knows, Worry Free Dinners is the first event series of its kind. Experts agree that allergies in general -- both food and inhalant -- are on the rise, but no one is sure why. Research on food allergies has been slow because \"for a long time, people thought this was a small problem,\" Munoz-Furlong said. The largest group of studies on the subject are in progress, including immunotherapy for people with peanut and milk allergies, she said. The majority of food allergy cases -- about 80 percent -- are \"cyclic,\" with mild symptoms that resemble those of pollen or dust allergies: sneezing, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion, said Dr. Alpen Patel, assistant professor of otolaryngology at Emory University. Other people experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhea consistently in response to certain foods. But for some people, ingesting something that even accidentally touched tree nuts or peanuts could result in anaphylaxis, a severe reaction that can lead to blocked airways, cardiovascular collapse, and even death. This is called a \"fixed food allergy,\" he said. After one severe reaction, he said, most people consistently avoid the offending food and do not experience another severe attack. But they also always carry a shot of epinephrine to self-administer immediately in case they experience signs of anaphylaxis. Enjoying food in spite of allergies . Miller has made a career of helping people with food allergies and other special dietary needs navigate their meals, whether at Thanksgiving or on a date, without feeling sick. She runs her own coaching practice, blogs and organizes Worry Free Dinners events under her umbrella organization Allergic Girl Resources Inc. She herself has dealt with allergies all her life -- as a baby she developed a rash when her mother switched from breast milk to cow's milk, and at age 2 she had a reaction to tree nuts. She has since learned that she also has some form of allergy to salmon, lemon grass, eggplant, some types of melons and most tropical fruits. But Miller, now 36, did not want her food allergies to prevent her from sampling the cornucopia of New York City restaurants. She developed relationships with restaurants that would accommodate her needs, and began organizing dinners for people who have similar allergy problems. \"It is both worry-free for the diner and worry-free for the restaurant,\" she said. \"Restaurants appreciate that I'm looking out for them as well ... I want to make it as easy as possible for them to have people like me come in all the time.\" Where everybody knows your name . So how does someone like Miller, who lives with food allergies plus a \"wheat/gluten-free, processed sugar-free, lactose-free, soy-free, low processed food-free lifestyle,\" safely enjoy eating out? Miller calls it the \"Cheers\" experience. The first time she goes to a restaurant, she always calls ahead and talks with the restaurant management to make sure they can accommodate her before making a reservation. Once at the restaurant, she'll meet the manager and give him or her a card with a run-down of her special dietary needs. Often a chef will join Miller and the manager to discuss the menu. By this point, Miller says, everyone has been introduced by name. After the meal, Miller thanks the server, chef and manager, and tips the server generously. She'll often call the next day and thank the manager for helping her eat safely. On her blog, allergicgirl.blogspot.com, Miller finds no shortage of restaurant meals to recommend and photograph. She'll find creative alternatives to traditionally prepared foods that look no less appetizing than more familiar versions -- for instance, she recently had fish-free sushi made of potato tempura, sticky rice, avocado and sesame seeds. Not every restaurant will accommodate Miller's special needs -- she has been refused service at some restaurants. But in general, she's found that restaurants have become far more understanding than five years ago, if only because staff members have children with food allergies. \"That changes how they run their kitchen,\" she said. \"More and more people are touched by this, and do get it.\"", "4192ba32e5bf2064d0d1b06e8d5b80eb434c72c5": "NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Gangs of young men armed with machetes are roaming the streets in Kenya as post-election violence threatens to engulf the country. Horrific attacks are being reported, including the torching of a church where people who had sought refuge were burned alive. At least 148 people have been killed and about 75,000 have fled their homes since President Mwai Kibaki won a narrow victory, according to Kenyan government officials. The Associated Press reported a higher number -- about 275 -- have died since Saturday. Much of the violence is between supporters of Kibaki from the majority Kikuyu tribe and backers of opposition leader Raila Odinga, who is from the Luo tribe. The ethnic violence, previously rare in Kenya, is reminiscent of the strife that led to the Rwanda genocide.  In a particularly disturbing incident, a mob appears to have burned a church filled with Kenyans seeking refuge from the violence. The Red Cross told The Associated Press that at least 50 were burned to death at the church, some of them children.   As many as 200 people were at the church, about 185 miles northwest of Nairobi, KTN reporter Tony Biwott told CNN. Watch as machete-wielding looters haul away goods \u00bb . Biwott said he counted at least 15 charred bodies, including children, in the burned church and an adjacent field. \"I'm sure there were more than 15 but I couldn't count the ones who were ashes,\" he said in a phone interview. The wounded sustained gunshot wounds, burns and cuts from a panga, a machete-like weapon, the Red Cross said. Watch smoke darken skies near a burned church . The national police commissioner has said in Kenyan society, churches are considered sacred and no one would expect such violence there. He said an investigation into the incident is under way. About 120 people are reported dead and over 1,000 injured countrywide, according to The Red Cross. Police and political backers of opposition leader Raila Odinga began clashing about four days ago as Odinga, of the Luo tribe, narrowly lost Kenya's presidential election to Mwai Kibaki. Kibaki is a member of Kikuyu, Kenya's largest tribe. Violence broke out in several cities as frustration mounted during the slow hand-count of the ballots. Kibaki was re-elected with 51.3 percent of the vote, to 48.7 percent for Odinga. \"What we now witness is a cold and calculated plan to organize and engage in massacres,\" government spokesman Alfred Mutua said. Bringing in the New Year, Kibaki -- who rarely speaks to the press -- urged calm to the nation. \"It now is a time for healing and reconciliation amongst all Kenyans,\" he said. Foreign Minister Raphael Tuju said the government is committed to taking control. \"If the tear gas doesn't work then unfortunately they have to use live bullets,\" he told CNN. \"The president has been sworn in, the elections are over, the Kenyans have to accept the results, the opposition has to accept the results.\" Tuesday, international observers said the balloting fell short of international standards for democratic elections. Alexander Lambsdorff, the head of the EU Election Observation Mission in Kenya, cited discrepancies in vote counts, election observers being turned away from polling places and observers being refused entrance to the electoral commission vote-counting room. The violence also has displaced some 75,000 Kenyans inside the country, Mutua said. The government said Tuesday it will not allow any political rallies in the aftermath of the controversial election outcome. Odinga's opposition Orange Democratic Movement had scheduled rallies for Tuesday, raising fears of more violence. Mutua said there was no intention to impose a state of emergency or curfew at this point, and said police are handling the violence well and with \"extreme restraint.\" However, he warned that police restraint would not last forever. The violence is rare for Kenya, which has enjoyed relative calm even as war and chronic political violence wracked neighboring countries, such as Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda. The United States has withheld congratulations for Kibaki, citing concerns of voting problems, even though Kibaki has claimed victory.

French soldiers patrol in Afghanistan in May 2008. French and NATO authorities confirmed the deaths and said 21 other soldiers were wounded in the fighting in the Sarobi area in Kabul province, about 30 miles northeast of the capital. The clashes began late Monday afternoon and continued into Tuesday, when the casualties occurred, French officials said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said his \"determination is intact\" to continue \"this battle against terrorism for democracy and liberty.\" \"The cause is just. It is an honor for France and its armies to defend them,\" said Sarkozy, who will travel Tuesday night to Afghanistan, the Defense Ministry said. Last month, nine U.S. soldiers were killed in fighting in eastern Afghanistan. U.S., British, Canadian and Dutch troops have been engaged in much of the combat in Afghanistan. The United States has been urging other countries in the NATO-led alliance to help ease the burdens of those troops on the front lines. About 1,670 French troops serve in Afghanistan under NATO's International Security Assistance Force, according to ISAF's Web site. Before this incident, a total of 12 French troops had died in several incidents during the Afghan war, mostly in combat. As for the latest fighting, NATO said the initial patrol -- which included Afghan forces -- had been \"reinforced with quick reaction forces, close air support and mobile medical teams.\" It said \"a large number of insurgents were killed.\" Gen. Zahir Azimi, an Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman, said Tuesday that Afghan army forces rushed to the battle scene soon after the attack took place. He said 27 militants were killed and 14 were wounded in the fighting, and 13 of the bodies were recovered by the Afghan army. He said one of the dead militants was identified as a Pakistani national. The Taliban posted a Web statement saying its forces attacked an \"American\" convoy, killing 20 soldiers and destroying five military tanks. It also said foreign forces later Tuesday bombarded the region and killed five Taliban militants and several civilians. The fighting came after authorities tightened security on Monday in anticipation of militant attacks on the country's Independence Day. Several suicide bombers struck an American base about 12 miles from the border with Pakistan in Khost province on Tuesday, but U.S. and Afghan forces repelled the onslaught. Seven insurgents were killed in the attack on Forward Operating Base Salerno, including three suicide bombers who blew themselves up after forces from the base encountered them more than 3,000 feet from the base, ISAF said in a statement. U.S. and Afghan troops noticed the approaching militants by their \"special behavior,\" the spokesman said. Helicopters flew in to attack them, the force said. ISAF said it suffered no casualties. Gov. Arsallah Jamal of Khost province said four commandos -- presumably Afghans -- were wounded when the militants struck late Monday. A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said 15 suicide bombers with small arms and machine guns entered the base and inflicted heavy casualties -- claims that the NATO-led force and Khost governor dismissed. That attack came after a suicide car bombing outside the same base killed 10 Afghan civilians and wounded 13 others Monday, the U.S. military said. Two other would-be bombers were killed before they could carry out attacks, Jamal said. Afghan forces stopped a second would-be car bomb near the base, performed a controlled detonation and detained a suspect, the NATO-led force said. This comes as a source from the Afghan Defense Ministry, who declined to be named, confirmed that Pakistani army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani arrived in Kabul on Tuesday morning to meet with Afghan and NATO military officials. In southern Afghanistan, a suicide bomber struck a Canadian foot patrol on Tuesday in the Kandahar province district of Panjwayee, local police said. The bomber and an Afghan interpreter for NATO forces were killed and a NATO soldier and a child were wounded, police said. The attack occurred as troops chatted with villagers in the district's main bazaar. The Taliban, in a Web statement, said 11 foreign soldiers were killed or wounded in the attack.

Treasure hunters use modern technology to try to locate the lost Nazi gold. Heinz Peter Haustein, one of the two treasure hunters and a member of Germany's parliament, said: \"We have already hit a hollow area under the surface, it's filled with water and we are not sure if it is the cave we are looking for.\" Digging was stopped more than a week ago amid safety concerns, as authorities and the treasure hunters feared that the shaft might collapse and that the cave -- if it is there -- may be rigged with explosives or poisonous booby traps. At a news conference Friday, Christian Hanisch, the other treasure hunter, said that geological surveying equipment had located a possible cave about 30 feet under the surface containing \"precious metals that can only be either gold or silver. The instruments would not have reacted to any other metal like copper.\"  See photos from hunt for lost Nazi gold \u00bb . Hanisch pointed out that his father, who was a navigator in the Luftwaffe, the Nazi air force, was one of the troops said to have been involved in hiding art, gold and silver as the Nazis realized that they would lose the war. He said that when his father died, he left coordinates leading to the spot in Deutschneudorf. \"It's not about getting the reward,\" Hanisch said at the site. \"I just want to know if my father was right and if my instincts were right.\" Haustein, who is paying for the expedition, said he hopes that finding the gold could lead to the Amber Room, whose interior is made completely of amber and gold. It was looted by the Nazis from a castle in St. Petersburg, Russia, after Adolf Hitler's forces invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. The room looked so majestic, many called it \"the eighth wonder of the world.\" It disappeared after the war, and today a replica stands in its place in St. Petersburg. Although parts of the Amber Room have resurfaced, the vast majority remains missing. Haustein has been looking for the room for more than 12 years.  Watch hunt for Nazi gold at German mountain \u00bb . \"I am certain that large parts of the Amber Room are buried somewhere here,\" he said. He said he has collected much circumstantial evidence suggesting that the Nazis hid the Amber Room in old copper mines around Deutschneudorf, but he has no proof. Haustein said the Nazis began bringing valuables including art, gold and silver to the region around Deutschneudorf as early as summer 1944. Deutschneudorf is in Germany's Ore Mountains, and the mountain where the treasure hunters claim to have found the Nazi gold was a copper mine until the 19th century. Although the mine was shut down in 1882, geologists found evidence that soldiers from Hitler's Wehrmacht -- the German armed forces -- had been there. The machine guns, parts of uniforms and explosives are on display at the town's museum. Though both treasure hunters say they are certain they will find cultural goods, both admit that they fear disappointment. \"Of course, if you embark on something like this, you ask yourself: 'What if we find nothing again? What if I was fooled?' \" Haustein said. \"But every man has to go his own way, for better or for worse.\" If they do find the treasure, Haustein says, it would legally belong to Germany, although he would recommend that Germany give any Amber Room parts back to Russia. Treasure hunters have typically received rewards of 10 percent of the value of the goods found, but Hanisch says there are no laws dictating the reward amount.

Dunwoody was nominated to be America's first four-star female general. President Bush nominated Lt. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody to serve as head of the Army's supply arm. By law women are excluded from combat jobs, the typical path to four-star rank in the military. \"This is an historic occasion for the Department of Defense and I am proud to nominate Lt. Gen. Ann Dunwoody for a fourth star,\" said Defense Secretary Robert Gates. \"Her 33 years of service, highlighted by extraordinary leadership and devotion to duty, make her exceptionally qualified for this senior position.\" The Senate must approve the nomination. Dunwoody, a native of New York, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1975 after her graduation from the State University of New York in Cortland. She also holds graduate degrees in national resource strategy and logistics management. She became the Army's top-ranking woman in 2005 when she received her third star and became deputy chief of staff for Army logistics. \"I am very honored but also very humbled today with this announcement,\" said Dunwoody. \"I grew up in a family that didn't know what glass ceilings were. This nomination only reaffirms what I have known to be true about the military throughout my career ... that the doors continue to open for men and women in uniform.\" The Army Materiel Command handles all material readiness for the Army. During her career, Dunwoody has been assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, 10th Mountain Division and the Defense Logistics Agency. She served with the 82nd Airborne in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. She has been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, Master Parachutist Badge and the Army Staff Identification Badge. The first woman to become a general officer in the U.S. armed services was Brig. Gen. Anna Mae Hays, chief of the Army Nurse Corps, who achieved the rank in 1970 and retired the following year. Elizabeth Hoisington, the director of the Women's Army Corps, was promoted to brigadier general immediately after Hays. She also retired the following year. Maj. Gen. Jeanne M. Holm, the first director of Women in the Air Force, was the first woman to wear two stars, attaining the rank in 1973 and retiring two years later. In 1996, Marine Lt. Gen. Carol A. Mutter became the first woman to wear three stars. Mutter retired in 1999.

Authorities are seeking Dale Barlow, 50, seen in a mugshot from a 2005 arrest on child sex charges. The emergency vehicles were called for as investigators prepared to search the group's temple, law enforcement officials said. The sect is a rogue branch of the Mormon church, which forbids nonbelievers from entering its temples. Authorities wanted medical backup \"in case they're involved in sensitive areas that could escalate into a negative reaction,\" a law enforcement source said. A police helicopter also had begun circling the ranch Saturday night. Earlier, dozens more children and young women were removed from the compound. A total of 183 people, including 137 children, have been taken away since law enforcement officers raided the compound Thursday night, said Marleigh Meisner, a spokeswoman for the Texas Child Protective Services Division. The children -- most of them girls -- were being interviewed by special investigators, she said. \"We're trying to find out if they're safe,\" she explained. \"We need to know if they have been abused or neglected.\" Eighteen of the girls have been taken into state custody. Authorities believe that they \"had been abused or were at immediate risk of future abuse,\" said Child Protective Services spokesman Darrell Azar. The others were taken to a nearby civic center. Meisner described them as doing \"remarkably well.\"  Watch a report on the latest developments \u00bb . Authorities continue to search the 1,900-acre YFZ ranch, occupied by followers of imprisoned polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs, and at least one man is being sought by police. According to the search warrant, authorities are looking for Dale Barlow, 50, whom they suspect of having married and fathered a child with a 16-year-old girl.  Watch an Eldorado neighbor talk about the raid \u00bb . Law enforcement agencies raided the ranch Thursday night after receiving a report Monday that a 16-year-old girl had been \"sexually and physically abused,\" Azar said.  Watch buses take girls from compound \u00bb . The warrant cited an \"immediate need\" for authorities to have access to the 16-year-old and an 8-month-old child with either the last name of Barlow or the girl's last name. It instructs law enforcement officers to look for any records showing that Barlow and the girl were married and any evidence of them having a child. Barlow is in Arizona and does not know his accuser, his probation officer told The Salt Lake Tribune. \"He said the authorities had called him [in Colorado City, Arizona], and some girl had accused him of assaulting her, and he didn't even know who she was,\" Bill Loader said. Barlow pleaded no contest last year to conspiracy to commit sexual conduct with a minor, The Associated Press reported. He was ordered to register as a sex offender for three years, according to the AP. His lawyer in that case told the AP he had not spoken to Barlow in a year. Jeffs, the 52-year-old leader and \"prophet\" of the 10,000-member church, was convicted in Utah last year and sentenced to 10 years on two counts of being an accomplice to rape, charges related to a marriage he performed in 2001. He faces trial in Arizona on eight charges of sexual conduct with a minor, incest and conspiracy. Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints bought the land near Eldorado four years ago and built the ranch, which they call the YFZ Ranch. The letters are said to refer to the words Yearning for Zion. It is home to as many as 400 members who relocated from their Arizona and Utah compounds. State and local law enforcement agencies set up roadblocks around the ranch Thursday evening, preventing journalists from seeing what was happening on the property, according to Randy Mankin, editor of the Eldorado Success weekly newspaper. \"This came totally out of the blue,\" Mankin said. There were no indications of violence around the ranch, he said. When CNN crews have visited the ranch, it was guarded by armed men equipped with night vision gear and other high-tech surveillance tools to prevent intruders. When CNN flew over the ranch in a small plane last year, the crew saw a massive temple, the three-story housing units where Jeffs' chosen followers live, the water tower, the school and community center, the dairy and cheese factory and a massive concrete mill. The church openly practices polygamy in two towns straddling the Arizona-Utah state line -- Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona -- but members living on their Texas ranch rarely venture into Eldorado, four miles to the south. Critics of the sect say that it arranges marriages for girls as young as 13 and that competition for brides may be reduced through exiling young men. If male followers are excommunicated, the critics claim, their wives and children can be reassigned to someone else. E-mail to a friend .

The animals were in the center of the lagoon and not near guests, she said. The dolphin who died was named Sharky. The other dolphin, Tyler, is being watched by veterinarians but appears to be fine, Bides said. \"This is an unfortunate, random incident,\" Bides said in a written statement. \"While it is not unusual to have two animals performing aerial behaviors at the same time, we are reviewing the situation to ensure even such a random incident does not occur again.\" E-mail to a friend .", "97ed47519371db40473f71f77a52a7beb5f0a7ef": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- They first met in the autumn of 1979; she playing the role of the lovelorn terrorist, he dressed as a rather sloppy Ayatollah Khomeini. Pamela Stephenson first met Billy Connolly on the set of a comedy show in 1979. They married in Fiji in 1990. It may not have been love at first sight on the set of British comedy show \"Not the Nine O'Clock News,\" but love, marriage and children eventually followed. Australian comedienne, now psychotherapist, Pamela Stephenson, describes being captivated by Billy Connolly's wildman looks, his mane of grey hair and devil-may-care demeanor. She tells CNN's Revealed about her first impressions of her husband, his unique ability to keep audiences entertained and what she learnt about his addictions and childhood abuse while writing his best-selling biography, \"Billy.\" CNN: Take us back to the beginning. How did you meet Billy Connolly? Pamela Stephenson: I'm not quite sure what Billy's version of how we met is like because he was very drunk. I met him when I was a performer on \"Not The Nine O'Clock News\" and he was a guest. He was just shaggy and some kind of terrible beastie. But I was attracted to him immediately, maybe because he was so unusual. I think what I picked up on was his dichotomy -- that beastiness and the underlying sensitivity that he has. I think that's something that audiences relate to, you're aware of all the toughness, but underneath you just know that there's philosophy and this poetic, Celtic nature that speaks to people. Also his pain, his underlying sadness and the pain of his childhood ... when I first met him I think I connected with that. He played the Ayatollah Khomeini in a scene on \"Not The Nine O'Clock News\" and I played a demented fan singing a love song to him, it was in days when you could do stuff like that, I suppose. And then we did an interview, I pretending to be British TV personality Janet Street-Porter, with giant fake teeth which kept falling out. Of course, he could never keep a straight face; I thought he was dreadfully unprofessional because he just kept laughing, especially when my teeth fell out -- my fake teeth --  fell out. CNN: What's it like being married to him? PS: People always think that being married to Billy means that I get non-stop Billy Connolly concerts. It's not nearly as exciting as that, although he's adorable. But it's boring sometimes and he would say the same. There are moments when I wish he would go and make me a cup of tea, which he does very often. Actually, Billy is quite a quiet person. He's a little reclusive and I don't think it's necessarily his personality. With the highs he experiences on stage he needs to be very quiet when he's not.  Billy Connolly takes CNN's Revealed on a tour of his home \u00bb . CNN: What made you write a biography of his life? Was it the first time he opened up about his childhood? PS: When I wrote \"Billy,\" it was the first time that Billy really looked at his childhood in a chronological order and with depth. It was a painful process, but cathartic. The book gave me the opportunity to understand a lot more about him. Just putting some of this together, the sexual abuse, for example, that he received from his father, the physical abuse he received from his aunts, helped me understand why there's a part of him that's very closed off.  Watch Billy recall his troubled childhood \u00bb . His learning disability was never understood. Now we'd call it an attention disorder. In those days, he had difficulty concentrating, for which he was beaten and taunted at school. People told him he was stupid and to this day there's a part of him that thinks that's he's not as clever as other people and yet he is absolutely brilliant. He's incredibly well-read and very erudite. CNN: Can you tell us about Billy's problems with alcohol and drugs and how you helped him? PS: Billy was extremely famous in Scotland, and you know what happens, especially with people who don't think they are very worthy. As with Billy, they don't handle fame because they don't feel they deserve it and they'll turn to alcohol and drugs. It became very serious and by the time I met him he was on a very self-destructive path. At first, that was appealing to me, but later I realized I can't be with somebody like that because I don't want to watch him destroy himself. I didn't tell him, \"You've gotta clean up your act,\" I just said I can't deal with this. I discovered you can't make anyone stop drinking or stop taking drugs, you have to just protect yourself and if they want to jump on the good train, they will. Fortunately it worked. CNN: How would you describe Billy's style of comedy? PS: Billy doesn't have a style, because to have a style it would mean that there have to be other people with a similar way of working. He goes on stage and it's like he's got these comedy angels whispering in his ear. He makes this extraordinary connection with the audience, and of course he's very astute and funny about politics. He sees the funny side of all kinds of things -- human nature, human behavior, world events, politicians. He'll talk about that with such passion. It's what many of us think but don't want to say. Billy will see something on television or notice something on the street or he'll just think something and it'll go into his computer of a brain and it'll stumble out when he's on stage.  See Billy Connolly perform on a recent tour of Ireland \u00bb . CNN: Is he the same person on and off stage? PS: He's honest and real. He's a man of the people, a working class hero. It's a clich\u00e9, but people know that he has struggled; they know he's come from the tough part of Glasgow. Billy just loves an audience, he loves speaking to people if they're nice to him, and they usually are. When he's finished his show, he doesn't go home. He stays in his dressing room and people will come and see him and he'll talk to them for another hour. CNN: He says he's getting more and more nervous when he goes on stage -- have you noticed a change? PS: I don't think he's getting more nervous. At his age, maybe he thinks that it should have become easier -- well, it's not going to become easier. It's incredibly tough to go on stage in front of four or five thousand people and sustain [their interest] by yourself. And one thing that really impresses me, again as a psychologist, is that I think he is really healing. I think that people really have the opportunity to just laugh like that and it's so good for you. I feel fantastic when I go to one of his shows and come out and I'm just sick with laughter. CNN: How does he feel when he comes off stage? He says it can be tough and envies the audience. They can go home and forget about it. PS: Most performers struggle with the letdown after a show, and Billy's no exception. It's tough because it takes time for adrenalin to leave the system. That's actually one reason why a lot of comedians turn to alcohol, because it's a depressant and takes you down. Now that Billy doesn't drink he's found another way -- he goes back to his hotel and stays quiet. Sometimes he likes to eat after the show but not very often. He will just want to veg out, watch TV. Playing his banjo is a great way for him to relax.  Watch a rare performance of Billy on banjo \u00bb . He doesn't like me being around when he's touring because he just likes to do his thing. I want to have some food or go and do something. He becomes a bit of a hermit, and that's appropriate for someone who expends that amount of energy and brainpower on stage. CNN: Billy says he finds the routine of touring increasingly tough -- do you think he will stop soon? PS: When Billy's touring, he'll say, \"Oh I don't want to tour anymore, I've had enough it's too hard on the road.\" But the truth is, when he's not touring, he wants to go back. It's probably his happiest time. I have been a comedian so I know a little bit about what it's like to be on stage and know that when things are working fantastically, and you're getting that appreciation from the audience. It is an incredible high. It's pretty hard for me as a wife or us as a family or any of his fans or friends to match up to that kind of adulation and so, you know, he deserves it and I have to remind him that it is a lot of fun for him. CNN: How would you describe his dress sense? PS: Billy is a fashion maven. He spends most of his time in New York now so, you know, the New York \"Black is the new black\" is ... that's got to him a bit. He's influenced by Rock 'n' Roll and Vivienne Westwood and edgy stuff. But he just puts it together in his own unique way. He also takes great pride in his body. His closet is still extremely fun. It's far more colorful than mine. I have grey and black suits and things for work -- he loves colorful shirts. It will be a shame if he tones himself down, but I don't think that will happen. He borrows my clothes sometimes, if he sees something particularly mad. We used to say, \"First up, best dressed,\" which is the Glasgow expression for a particularly fun brooch or hat.", "7d1ac9703ec57562903cb8238e356b04d7a01f72": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling is writing a prequel to her best-selling series  to be auctioned for charity -- but at just 800 words, it may lack some of the magic fans of the boy wizard might be hoping for. Autographed copies of J.K. Rowling's work have fetched millions of dollars at auction. Rowling's hand-written prequel, signed by the author, will be auctioned alongside works by other famous writers to raise cash for a dyslexia charity. Despite the brevity of the piece, experts believe it could fetch big money, since other autographed works by the blockbuster author have sold for millions of dollars. \"We never dreamed that J.K. Rowling would donate something so precious, and we're incredibly grateful,\" said Gerry Johnson, managing director of Waterstone's, the UK book chain organizing the auction. \"I can't begin to guess how much it will raise at auction.\" A previous 93-word storycard from Rowling, which referred to the book \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\" sold in 2002 for $53,000. Rowling later produced seven hand-written copies of a new work, \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard,\" one of which sold for $3.9 million in 2007. \"Given the enormous interest we have seen in recent times for autograph work by J.K. Rowling, the prospects for her storycard are good to say the least,\" said Philip Errington, a specialist at Sotheby's auction house, which is helping to organize the sale. The card on which the story is written -- measuring 14.6 by 20.9 centimeters (5.75 by 8.25 inches) -- is signed \"JK Rowling 2008.\" The author signs off with the message: \"From the prequel I am not working on -- but that was fun!\" Alongside Rowling, 13 other authors invited to contribute to the June 10 auction include Margaret Atwood, Sebastian Faulks, Nick Hornby, and Tom Stoppard.

Sarah Jessica Parker was a driving force in creating the \"Sex and the City\" movie. Then came the inevitable cry: That's it? What happens next? Sarah Jessica Parker, who played Carrie, wanted to find out as well. But the situation had to be right, she said, which prompted a cascade of rumors as plans for a movie came together, fell apart and came together again. Now that the movie is out, Parker -- who's a producer of the film as well as one of its stars -- talked about the journey to making a big-screen \"Sex and the City\" with \"Showbiz Tonight\" anchor A.J. Hammer. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: I think a lot of fans, maybe a lot of people, and those of you among the cast, didn't think this day would actually ever come ... but here we are. So how are you feeling deep inside, Sarah? Sarah Jessica Parker: I feel extraordinarily privileged. I've spent the last two years cobbling this movie together. ... It's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of professional experience and one really shouldn't be greedy enough to ask for it twice.  Watch the cast talk about the thrill of \"Sex\" \u00bb . I have to say that, this last six, eight months, was better than those seven years [the show aired] and I think it's because we all recognize how lucky and unique those seven years were and that this is a story that you don't get to tell twice. It has been, I must say, worth every obstacle and dead end, and fit and start, and every moment that was seemingly impossible. It has been a dream. CNN: And I imagine sitting down for the first time in that room together for the table read, which was, from my understanding, the first time you all actually were in the same room [together] regardless of how much you kept in touch. Tell me a little bit about that moment. Parker: I started putting [the] script back together in April of 2006 ... and that [table read] was a really extraordinary day, because just the perfunctory details of getting people to a table read were complicated. Kim [Cattrall] had been away and Kristin [Davis] had been away and Chris [Noth] had been [doing] his other job, and this magnificent script had arrived and had been everything we hoped for and more. It was basically like being in an alternate universe for about three hours. ... It was a kind of reunion that is very, very special, because you really want to be there. It's not the reunion where you're forced by your parents to meet your aunts and uncles that you see rarely. It's the reunion that you want. I think even more so was that first day on [the] set. When we thought, good God, [writer/director] Michael Patrick [King] and I are actually making this movie, like we got it done, we're here, we're doing it -- what a privilege. CNN: I think we as fans and viewers actually got a sense of what that feeling was like when we saw you all together on \"Oprah,\" because the energy was ... palpable. ... But we're talking about the perceived drama around this whole project. (Rumors have abounded about friction between the stars.) One of my producers said while we were watching the TV, \"Are they going to sit near each other?\" \"Why are they putting Chris in the middle of all of them?\" Hearing that, does it make you mad? Parker: I find it slightly -- it's not that I'm mad. I expect better from people. I think it's really beneath me, to keep defending myself. I have a 35-year career. I have an impeccable character, I really pride myself in my work ethic and the way I treat people. And I think Kim would say the same and Cynthia would say the same. And I love Kim, and I wanted her to be in this movie. We couldn't have done it without her, we couldn't have done it without Kristin, we couldn't have done it without Cynthia [Nixon], nor could we have done it without Chris.  Watch Cattrall address the rumors \u00bb . You know, this is a story that people like to tell about women. Why? I don't know. Is it that interesting? Probably not. So once again I just have to say it doesn't define the experience. Nobody can take the experience away. It's far more interesting for me to talk about my affection for this cast than to start to deny a sad old beaten tale. CNN: You seem to have what goes on in the media in perspective -- and you have to, being at the game as long as you've been. To that end, one of the things that I've always admired about you and [husband] Matthew [Broderick] and I think a lot of people do, is how you've managed your public or your private life while being in the glare of the spotlight. ... Now I know one of the main reasons you guys are able to make it work is because you don't talk about your private lives, which is great and I applaud that. That said, is there something that you can tell me about what it is about your relationship that enables you to make it work separate from that? Parker: I wouldn't make any proclamations about why I have a marriage that, to me, is successful. I would just say that we've chosen to live in a city where we are not the most interesting people. This is a city that is about industry and finance and publishing and architecture and the arts and education and academia, and the movie industry fits into it in some small way, but there are a lot of people of important interest and I think that it's a conscious choice to live in a place where we're bumping up against humanity. We run to the market on our own, we take the subway, and we integrate into our city, and we become a part of the fabric and I think it's really been to our benefit and certainly to our son. Does it mean that we are not scrutinized and that we don't have paparazzi every single day at our house? No, but it is a city where you can't live behind a gate, you can't drive up in a car and be protected. You walk out the door and it is what it is. So you reconcile those things and you make the best choices you can. CNN: Is it the end of \"Sex and the City\"? What does your gut tell you? Parker: My gut tells me it's up to you and your colleagues and the critics and the people who show up. The future is dictated not by us at this point, and I think Michael Patrick and I have been so focused at getting this movie up on the big screen, that we haven't thought about the future. Doing this was more than we could have asked for. So anything beyond that is really kind of out of our hands in a perfectly wonderful way.", "1410227a01322fd4ad6b7386615d2d4dae669bc8": "(CNN) -- The wife of missing adventurer Steve Fossett has asked a court to declare him dead. Steve Fossett and wife Peggy in a February 2006 photograph. Fossett was last seen in early September, flying a single-engine plane on a pleasure flight from a Nevada ranch. A month-long search for the plane was unsuccessful. \"As difficult as it is for me to reach this conclusion, I no longer hold out any hope that Steve has survived,\" wrote Peggy V. Fossett in court documents filed Monday with the Cook County [Illinois] Circuit Court. She asked that the will of her husband of 38 years be admitted to probate. At about 8:45 a.m. on September 3, the millionaire took off on what he said was to be a solo pleasure flight over the Sierra Nevada mountain range. He had planned to fly over the Nevada desert for two to three hours, and was expecting to return for lunch to the Nevada ranch, from which he departed. He was carrying a single bottle of water and had no parachute, lawyers for Mrs. Fossett said in the court documents. At 3 p.m., when he had not returned, a search began that ultimately included thousands of volunteers. It continued until October 2. \"No one involved in the search holds out any hope that Fossett is still alive,\" the petition said. Rick Rains, a sheriff's supervisor of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, said Fossett's plane was last spotted at 11 a.m. less than 20 miles from the ranch's airport. \"Given the timeline and the sighting of Fossett's plane, I believe he was within 20 to 25 miles of the ranch when he crashed,\" Rains said. But, he noted, \"the terrain is very difficult to search, with many areas where the crevices, deep ravines and closely grown trees make it impossible to see from the air what is on the ground.\" \"If Fossett was physically able to find water to survive on in the Nevada desert, he would have been physically capable of signaling searchers, by doing something as simple as crafting a large X of sticks or rocks, or by starting a signal fire,\" Rains said. In affidavits supporting his wife's petition, Fossett's doctor described the 63-year-old man as physically and mentally fit. Robert Keilholtz, a captain in the California Civil Air Patrol who was involved in the search, noted that the difficulty in finding wreckage was underscored by the fact that World War II-era plane wreckage was discovered last spring in the mountain range. In the search for Fossett, wreckage from eight other crashes was discovered, one of them from the 1960s, the lawyers said. Fossett made his money in the financial services industry, but is renowned for his daredevil exploits, which include nonstop, round-the-world trips aboard a balloon, a fixed-wing plane and a boat. At the time of his disappearance, Fossett was working on a project to build a single-man submarine and to build a vehicle capable of breaking land speed records by traveling at up to 800 mph, lawyers for his wife said.

The purpose of the visit was to expose these young minds (ages 15-17) to the existence of another India. Most of us have an illusion of India becoming a powerful nation and it is on a phenomenal growth trajectory. We are not so much seen as a developing nation but a developed nation. One wonders what actually makes a country developed, when most of the parameters of development are skewed, as is the case of our country. For the rest of the world India is powerful, but for many residing in the countryside, India is still disempowered, hungry and naked. Up to 70 percent of Indians still live in villages. Most of the time these villages are neglected and are centers of poverty. Development around India's cities has brought a flood of people from the rural areas who come in search of jobs. This population comprises the \"urban poor\" which is more vulnerable than the rural poor. Imagine, India still has more than 260 million people (26 percent of the population) living below the poverty line. In the last 10 years, we have had at least 40,000 farmer suicides in the country -- indicative of the growing gap between the poor and the rich. The purpose of this trip was to learn, and unlearn, about village stereotypes or notions we live with. The village in Uttaranchal wasn't as extreme an experience as other remote villages of India, but it was indicative of the hardships that people live with. Another reason for the trip was to celebrate the simplicity and generosity of the villagers vis-\u00e0-vis we, the insecure urbanites, and also to understand their hardships, due to our over-consumption and false assumption that our wrongdoing does not necessarily influence the rural population -- when we know it does. For many students, it was a first-time, first-hand experience of a village. Some were overwhelmed with the beauty and many were saddened by the villagers' plight. The outing also gave them an opportunity to contribute in some way. Students worked in the fields, helped the villagers in agricultural work and breathed the clean air. It was a wonderful experience, aimed at understanding the gap between the two exisiting worlds; to bridge the gap between these two worlds.

Tian Huiping considered suicide when she learned her son was autistic. Instead, she opened an autism school. Alone with her son after her husband divorced her, Tian became depressed and desperate enough to consider killing herself and her son, Yang Tao. \"I made a poison for me and my son,\" she said. But when she saw her boy smiling up at her happily, she says she couldn't do it. \"I thought, I have no right to end his life, and I cannot kill myself and leave him.\" From that horrible moment 18 years ago, there grew an incredible resolve -- the kind of dogged determination borne of a mother protecting her child. At one of the many hospitals she went to for help in Beijing, Tian came across a small brochure printed by the Taiwan Autism Association, explaining a few basic concepts on how to teach kids with autism.  Watch mom describe being near suicide with autistic child \u00bb . She read it over and over again. \"I just tried to work a little bit with my son and another boy we lived with,\" she says. \"And it worked -- a little bit -- but I saw hope.\" She rented space in a kindergarten and opened her own school at first, with just six autistic children. She slept on the floor in a store room to save money. Two months later, the kindergarten closed her down. \"We didn't make enough money for them,\" she says. But the children had shown progress, even though the teaching was based on a few simple concepts in a few pages of a brochure. Soon, the word was out. And more parents with autistic children came to Tian  looking for help, all of them with the same fears. \"If my son cannot go to school, what will happen with him? As a mother this is such a big worry.\" Fifteen years later, Tian and her Stars and Rain Education Institute for Autism help more than 3,000 children a day through her school and its outreach program. Eighty children of all ages enroll in her school for an 11-week course with their parents -- many of whom travel hundreds of miles from small villages to get help for their children. The parents then return to their villages to try to educate the local population.  Interactive: Autism 101 \u00bb . The Chinese government says there are only about 100,000 people with autism in the entire country, but unofficial estimates put the number between 1-2 million people, perhaps even more. Tian says her institute has a list of just 60 doctors nationwide who are capable of diagnosing autism. Fifteen years ago, she says there were just three. Because resources are scarce, the focus at her school is on teaching the parents how to educate their children. They first help parents to accept their child's disability and teach basic information about autism awareness. Programs are individualized for each child, with teachers working on verbal communication, managing tantrums and other early intervention methods. One of the parents is a woman named Fu Jing. It took three years and countless wrong diagnoses, before she finally learned why her son Ruoqi wasn't talking or playing with other kids, she said. When Fu leaned Ruoqi was autistic, her world collapsed. \"I thought about committing suicide with my son. I could not imagine the pain he would suffer when he grew up. All the unfair treatment from society and schoolmates,\" she said. \"As a mother, I felt so much pain.\" But now Fu is learning how to communicate with her son, how to raise him, even how to love him. \"The training here strengthens the acceptance of your kids. Honestly speaking, as an ordinary person, I get angry and even shout at him,\" she said. \"But here, they say we have to accept our kids as who they are. I feel that I have changed.\" There are no government programs to help parents with autistic children -- and there is no government help for Tian and her school. \"I'm not used to requesting anything from government,\" she says. \"We have grown up in such a situation.\" For the past three years, Stars and Rain has been working with Heartspring, a Kansas-based center for children with special needs. Teachers from Beijing have been sent to Wichita, Kansas, for training; and teachers like Connie Coulter have come to Stars and Rain. When she arrived in February, Coulter found a school with almost no resources and without access to the latest research. Some parents, she said, would come up to her and ask about a magic pill or vitamin \"to cure their child.\" \"In the villages where they're coming from, they're just viewed as basically throw-away children,\" she said. \"To tell [the parents] and be able to educate them, it was an exhilarating experience to talk to them about the basic understanding of autism.\"   Coulter described her time at the school as a \"life-changing experience.\" \"There are things that they have taught me about value of family, the passion, the empathy, the sacrifice that I don't see as much in the United States,\" she said. It's a sacrifice these parents feel lucky to make -- because in China, if your child has autism and you want to help, there is almost nowhere else to turn. E-mail to a friend .

Oil accounted for 94 percent of the Iraq's revenue from 2005 to 2007, a U.S. report says. Leading members of Congress, noting that Washington is paying for reconstruction in Iraq, expressed outrage at the assessment. One called the findings \"inexcusable.\" \"We should not be paying for Iraqi projects while Iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank, including outrageous profits from $4-a-gallon gas prices in the U.S.,\" said Sen. Carl Levin, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"We should require that U.S. taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects.\" Baghdad had a $29 billion budget surplus between 2005 to 2007. With the price of crude roughly doubling in the past year, Iraq's surplus for 2008 is expected to run between $38 billion and $50 billion, according to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The United States has put about $48 billion toward reconstruction since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, auditors reported. About $23 billion of that was spent on the oil and electricity industries, water systems and security. Iraq spent $3.9 billion on those sectors from 2005 through April 2008, according to the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress. The ongoing fighting there, a shortage of trained staff and weak controls have made it difficult for the Iraqi government to spend its surplus on needed projects, the agency's report concluded. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, has been an outspoken critic of the slow progress of reconstruction and an advocate of a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. His criticism Tuesday was echoed by Sen. John Warner, a Virginia Republican who is the former chairman and now a leading member of Levin's committee. \"Despite Iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years, U.S. taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of Iraq reconstruction funds,\" Warner said in a joint statement with Levin. \"It is time for the sovereign government of Iraq, using its revenues, expenditures and surpluses, to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the Iraqi people.\" In its written response to the audit report, the Treasury Department said U.S. officials are working with Iraqis to address the issue, \"and we believe progress is being made.\" \"The report shows Iraq's budget surplus is likely to grow significantly over the course of 2008, but it is equally important to realize that spending in Iraq is also increasing,\" Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Andy Baukol wrote to the GAO. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government submitted a $22 billion supplemental budget to the Iraqi parliament in July, including $8 billion in proposed capital expenditures, Baukol wrote. The issue raised the hackles of several members of Congress earlier this year -- particularly because Bush administration officials said on the eve of the war that Iraqi oil money would pay for reconstruction. In 2003, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz told the House Appropriations Committee: \"We're dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.'' Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, said Tuesday's report \"is going to make a lot of American families very angry.\" \"The record gas prices they are paying have turned into an economic windfall for Iraq, but the Iraqi government isn't spending the money on rebuilding,\" said Waxman, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Levin spokeswoman Tara Andringa said the senator hopes to tighten rules governing U.S. expenditures on Iraqi reconstruction efforts in the next Pentagon authorization bill. The Iraqi surplus has piled up even though the country's oil production has only recently matched prewar levels, according to the Brookings Institution's latest Iraq Index. The country spent about 80 percent of its $29 billion operating budget in 2007, including public services and salaries, but only 28 percent of its $12 billion investment budget, the GAO found. The export of crude oil accounted for 94 percent of Iraq's revenues from 2005 to 2007, the GAO reported.", "4c000361b448426117193f2ec0793ddd180cd17a": "(CNN) -- The mother of a missing toddler on Monday was arrested in connection with an alleged theft from one of her friends, Florida authorities said.

Russia said Thursday that its withdrawal of Gori would be complete within hours, and the U.S. said it looked like the Russian military was gearing up to leave, but CNN's Michael Ware confirmed that Russian troops were comfortably in control of Gori in the early hours of Friday. The town was a base for the Georgian military and is near the breakaway South Ossetia province where the conflict began. Meanwhile, there are reports of Russian vehicles on the move towards Poti, a port city in the west of Georgia. Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili said that more than 100 tanks and other vehicles are traveling in convoy between the cities of Senaki and Kutaisi. CNN has not independently confirmed the claim. \"I appeal for the help of every civilized person in the world to stop this uncivilized, barbarian, inhuman, treacherous, absolutely outrageous behavior, and to save innocent lives,\" Saakashvili said.

Obama accused McCain of supporting a track record from the Bush administration that included the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, a longer and more expensive war in Iraq than was initially projected, the continued freedom of September 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden and the strengthening of Iran after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. \"The American people are going to look at the evidence,\" he said. \"We don't get a sense that this has been a wise foreign policy or a smart foreign policy or a tough foreign policy. This has been a policy that oftentimes revolved around a lot of bluster and big talk, but very little performance, and what the American people want right now is performance.\" In a speech at the annual meeting of the National Rifle Association in Louisville, Kentucky, on Friday, McCain defended his foreign policy positions, saying the United States has a realistic chance of success in Iraq after four years of costly mistakes.

It is reckless to suggest that unconditional meetings will advance our interests.\" Speaking to reporters earlier, McCain said he disagreed with Obama's desire to talk with Iran's president. \"What you do, if you sit down face to face, as Sen. Obama wants to do, is you legitimize a regime that's dedicated to the extinction of Israel, supports terrorist organizations and is responsible for deaths of brave young Americans,\" McCain said. McCain also said he would not meet with representatives of Hamas, the Palestinian organization listed as a terrorist group by the United States and Israel, which won elections in 2006 and now controls Gaza while U.S.-friendly President Mahmoud Abbas controls the West Bank. Obama agreed with that position, calling Hamas a terrorist organization that has vowed to destroy Israel. But Obama said McCain and Bush have to answer for Iran's benefiting from the invasion of Iraq, Hamas' gaining control of Gaza and Iran's continued funding of terrorist organizations, all of which, he said, have affected U.S. security. \"That's the Bush-McCain record on protecting this country,\" he said at a Watertown, South Dakota, town hall meeting. \"Those are the failed policies that John McCain wants to double-down on.\" \"I am happy to have a debate with John McCain and George Bush about foreign policy,\" Obama said. \"I believe that there is no separation between George Bush and John McCain when it comes to our Middle East policy, and I think their policy has failed.\" In Kentucky, McCain said he would also welcome a debate about \"protecting America.\" \"No issue is more important,\" he said. \"Sen.

Britney Spears, left, and her mother Lynne Spears pose at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards in New York. A long convoy of police and a Los Angeles Fire Department ambulance transported the 26-year-old singer to the hospital after midnight, acting on what the Los Angeles Times reported was a \"mental evaluation hold.\" It was the second hospitalization for Spears this month. The police operation was planned far in advance and, according to the L.A. Times, followed a phone call to police from Spears' psychiatrist. Asked if her daughter was resting, mother Lynne Spears said \"Yes\" to a throng of reporters as she departed the medical center.  Watch scene at Spears' home \u00bb . The pop star's father Jamie Spears and her manager Sam Lufti also appeared at the hospital, neither choosing to speak to reporters. The latest incident in the troubled performer's saga began about 12:55 a.m. on Thursday when the North Hollywood Police Department sent about eight officers to Spears' hilltop house in Studio City, California, according to a law enforcement official, who asked not to be identified because he's not authorized to comment publicly.  See Spears timeline \u00bb . The group at Spears' house included plainclothes officers, motorcycle police, ambulance crews and some police \"brass,\" the official said. It took the better part of the day to arrange the transport plan, the officer said. On January 3, Spears was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she reportedly underwent a psychological evaluation.  Watch how mental evaluations work \u00bb . Andrew Blankstein, a Los Angeles Times reporter who was at the scene of Thursday's incident, told CNN that a police convoy, stretching the length of a football field, accompanied the ambulance as it drove down Coldwater Canyon Boulevard -- in part to keep the paparazzi from getting too close.  Watch police motorcade at Spears' home \u00bb . Spears was whisked out a side entrance to her house. \"You couldn't really see what was going on [when officers first swept into the residence] but on the police radio, there was some reference to 'The package is on the way out,' 'We're leaving now. Go, go, go,'\" Blankstein said. A few hours earlier, two officers were sent to investigate a report of a large group gathered outside the singer's home, said David Grimes, watch commander for the west division of the Los Angeles Police Department. The two officers found 20 to 25 people near the house around 11 p.m. Wednesday and they asked them to leave, he said. ABC-TV host Barbara Walters reported on Monday's \"The View\" that she had been contacted by Spears' manager and \"good friend,\" Lufti, who told her the pop star has seen a psychiatrist and \"is suffering from what he describes as mental issues which are treatable,\" according to The Associated Press.  Watch experts discuss Spears' behavioral issues \u00bb . During Spears' earlier hospitalization, in addition to the psychological evaluation, she was examined for possible influence of alcohol or drugs. Police had been called to her home that night to mediate a custody dispute.  A day later, a California court refused to grant Spears visitation rights with her two children -- Sean Preston, 2, and Jayden James, 1 -- at least until mid-February. Spears has been in a heated dispute with ex-husband Kevin Federline over custody of their sons. Federline, Spears' former backup dancer, holds primary custody of the children. Spears has been in trouble with the court earlier concerning her compliance with court orders in the custody case. After filing for divorce in November 2006, Spears was frequently seen enjoying Hollywood nightlife. Her behavior became increasingly erratic; in February 2007, she shaved her head as paparazzi looked on, then spent a month in rehab. E-mail to a friend .

Mohammed Asha, a doctor, is accused of conspiracy to murder and cause explosions. Bilal Abdulla and Mohammed Asha, both doctors, are charged with conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause explosions. Their trial at London's Woolwich Crown Court is expected to last up to 12 weeks. The case stems from the discovery in June 2007 of two explosives-filled Mercedes sedans in central London. One of the cars was parked across the street from a packed nightclub near Piccadilly Circus and the other was towed from an underground car park at Hyde Park. An ambulance crew notified police about the first car after they saw smoke coming from it. The second car was towed for a parking offense but drew suspicion because it smelled of gasoline. Officials said both cars cars were filled with fuel, gas canisters, and nails. Police managed to defuse them. The following day, with attention still focused on the averted attacks in the capital, a Jeep sped through the barriers outside Glasgow International Airport and slammed head on into the terminal. The Jeep, filled with propane gas, burst into flames and created a fireball. The driver and passenger jumped out of the car. One set himself on fire and later died in the hospital; the other was identified as Abdulla, an Iraqi doctor who had been practicing medicine in Scotland. Later that day, police arrested Asha as he was driving with his wife on a highway in Cheshire, England. Police said Asha, a doctor of Palestinian descent who grew up in Jordan, conspired with Abdulla to carry out the explosions. The incidents happened just days after British Prime Minister Gordon Brown took office.

Barack Obama a chance to steal the once reliably red state from Republicans. Sen. Barack Obama waves as rain falls on a rally in Fredericksburg, Virginia, in late September. Polls earlier this year showed Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, leading Obama, his Democratic rival, in Virginia by a healthy margin. A Virginia Commonwealth University poll taken May 12-18 had McCain leading 47 percent to 39 percent. But as the financial crisis has shaken voters' confidence in the economy, Obama has begun to open a lead in the state, as he has done in other battleground states. The latest CNN poll of polls has Obama leading McCain 49 percent to 45 percent. A CNN/TIME/Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted September 28-30 shows Obama with an even bigger lead over McCain, 53 percent to 44 percent. The CNN poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points. Polls show that voters have more confidence in Obama to handle the economic crisis than they do in McCain, and are more likely to blame Republicans for the recent turmoil than Democrats. Beside an advantage on the economy, Obama is also benefiting from a demographic shift that has reshaped Virginia politics. For the last 10 presidential elections, Republicans have been able to bank on Virginia delivering its 13 electoral votes to the GOP. President Bush won Virginia by 8 percentage points in both 2000 and 2004, and President Bill Clinton was never able to capture the state when he ran in 1992 and 1996. But the explosive growth of Northern Virginia in the last decade has changed the state's electorate. Drawn by government jobs in nearby Washington and high-tech jobs in the Dulles corridor, the growing population in Northern Virginia is more liberal than the mostly rural southern portion of the state, which has remained reliably Republican. In 2000, Bush carried Northern Virginia 49 percent to 47 percent, but in 2004, Sen. John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, carried the area 51 percent to 48 percent. Virginia \"is not as red as people think,\" said Doc Thompson, a conservative talk show host for WRVA radio. \"A third of the population in Northern Virginia is pretty liberal. A lot of people are buying into [Obama's] notion of change.\" Virginia Democrats have been able to exploit the changes in the electorate into statewide electoral success after years in which the Republicans had a virtual lock on the state. In fact, Virginia Republicans have not won a statewide race since Mark Warner, a former mobile phone company executive, captured the governorship for the Democrats in 2001 by emphasizing economic growth. Democrat Tim Kaine, who was Warner's lieutenant governor, succeeded Warner in 2005. And in what may have been the most surprising result of the 2006 election cycle, Democrat Jim Webb defeated the incumbent Republican George Allen in the race for one of Virginia's seats in the U.S. Senate. The trend favoring the Democrats is expected to continue this year, which is expected to help drive Virginia Democrats to the polls. The extremely popular Warner is almost certain to win this year's race against another former governor, Republican Jim Gilmore, to replace Virginia's long-standing Republican senator, John Warner, who is retiring. (The two Warners are not related, and John Warner was unopposed in 2002.) A Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted in late September found Warner leading Gilmore by 30 points, and Warner's victory would give Democrats control of both of Virginia's seats in the U.S. Senate for the first time since 1970. While conservatives may be demoralized by Gilmore's poor showing, McCain may also face eroding support from Virginia conservatives for his recent proposals for the government to become heavily involved in the U.S. economy, said Thompson, the radio talk show host. During Tuesday night's presidential debate, McCain suggested that the government directly buy up to $300 billion in home mortgages to help homeowners facing foreclosure. Thompson said that proposal, along with his support for a $700 billion bailout package to help Wall Street firms that McCain voted for last week, are two signs that McCain is breaking from the free-market principles that Virginia conservatives support and not stopping \"the march toward socialism\" that has begun since the economic crisis started. \"They missed a real opportunity, certainly, in Virginia with my listeners who say they want someone who is fiscally conservative,\" said Thompson, who added that he's considering voting for a third-party candidate. \"They could have come out and said, 'no more spending.' \" CNN's Scott Anderson contributed to this report.", "b5d3d3c763090609d7148039f458b6309cc9d636": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The California Public Utilities Commission banned texting on the job Thursday after it was shown that a Metrolink train engineer involved in last week's deadly collision near Los Angeles sent text messages from his cell phone. It was unclear what 46-year-old Robert Sanchez was doing at the time of the crash Friday. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating claims that he was sending text messages when his commuter train slammed into a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth. Twenty-five people were killed, including Sanchez, and at least 130 were injured. Investigators subpoenaed the phone records of the engineer and determined that he \"had sent and received text messages on the day of the accident, including some while he was on duty,\" according to an NTSB statement Wednesday. Investigators were trying to determine at what time the messages were sent. The commission's emergency order passed unanimously Thursday. In pushing for the ban, Commission President Michael Peevey said that cell phone use by engineers \"may have been a factor\" in train accidents this year in San Francisco and Sacramento, California. He did not elaborate on details of those incidents. Thursday's order is temporary until the state commission decides whether to make it permanent. Metrolink prohibits cell phone use by engineers on the job, but Peevey emphasized that there is no federal or California regulation barring cell phone use by engineers while trains are moving. The NTSB had determined that the brakes on the Metrolink train were not applied before the collision and that stop signals at the scene were working properly, said Kitty Higgins, an NTSB member assigned to the investigation. Metrolink has said its train, carrying about 220 passengers, failed to stop for a red signal.  Watch expert tell what it's like to drive a train \u00bb .

SUVs like these are having a tough time selling with gas prices at all-time highs. With gas at $4 a gallon, many have sat there since last summer. \"The cars are literally just sitting, and it doesn't matter how much you sell them for,\" Fernandez says of the SUVs and trucks nobody wants anymore. \"It's amazing. I've never seen it this bad -- ever.\" Fernandez, a wholesale auto dealer who has been in the business for more than 20 years, says SUV owners are hit especially hard. The really large ones with V-8 engines that can get as little as 12 miles per gallon in the city -- like the Cadillac Escalade, Ford Expedition and Chevy Suburban -- are dropping in value by the thousands.  Watch the sinking value of guzzlers \u00bb . The No. 1 reason for the sales slump is soaring gas prices, says Peter Brown, the executive director of Automotive News, the trade newspaper for the North American car industry. For the first four months of this year, truck and SUV sales are down a collective 24.8 percent. SUV sales plummeted 32.8 percent while pickups dipped 19.9 percent, he says. \"If gas prices stay where they are at or continue to rise, the body-on frame SUV is an endangered species and the pickup truck as a personal car is an endangered species,\" Brown says. How do owners react when they're told their once-$40,000-plus vehicles are now worth less than half that? \"When they find out what you think their truck is worth, they think you're trying to rip them off or something,\" says Fernandez. \"Small cars are gone within a week; SUVs are sitting here since last summer.\" David Lavi, the owner of a Toyota Tacoma pickup, is feeling that pinch. He put his truck on the market several weeks ago in hopes of downsizing. He bought it brand new in 2006 when gas prices were much lower. \"Once I do sell it, I'm going to get a smaller car -- maybe a Nissan Maxima or something smaller,\" he says. He's hoping to get $23,000 for the fully loaded truck, which is higher than the estimated Kelley Blue Book value of $15,000 to $19,000 depending on how many amenities it has. \"No one has offered what I want,\" he says. Automakers have noticed this trend to downsize. Ford announced Thursday it was shifting production away from its longtime hallmark of pickups and SUVs in favor of smaller cars. In making the decision, Ford said it believes gas prices will remain in the range of $3.75 to $4.25 a gallon through the end of 2009. \"We saw a real change in the industry demand in pickups and SUVs in the first two weeks of May,\" Ford chief executive Alan Mulally said Thursday. \"It seems to us we reached a tipping point.\" Brown of Automotive News said he wouldn't be surprised if General Motors and other automakers follow suit. According to AAA, gas prices reached another all-time high Friday, with the national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline at $3.87. Seven states are now over $4 a gallon, AAA says.  How much do you need to work to pay for your gas? \u00bb . Stories of owners ditching larger vehicles for smaller ones have started to become widespread. Owners say they're tired of spending as much as 80 to 100 bucks to fill up their tanks. Some CNN.com users recently shared their stories of buying used Geo Metros -- the oft-maligned, snail-sized car from the 1990s that gets gas mileage similar to a hybrid of today for a fraction of the sticker price. \"I used to be a car snob, and I used to be too vain to drive anything that doesn't shine,\" said Marci Solomon, an electrician who has a 100-mile commute to and from work. \"But now it's about, do I want to eat, or do I want to make it to work? I want to do both.\" But some auto experts caution owners against trading in their SUVs and trucks to save money at the pump because it may not be the wisest financial decision. Owners might owe $20,000 or more when the vehicle is now worth $12,000. It's similar to an upside-down mortgage, and it may not make sense to try a trade-in. \"What they might be doing is spending thousands of dollars to save hundreds,\" says Jack Nerad, the executive director of Kelley Blue Book's kbb.com. \"Because if you make a trade, you're most often going to spend more to make that move than you would just sucking it up and paying the extra gasoline prices.\" Back at the Los Angeles lot, Fernandez says he thinks the trend away from SUVs and pickups is here to stay. \"Just when you think that it's going to change any day now, it doesn't. It just continuously gets worse,\" he said.

Cook County, Illinois, Sheriff Thomas J. Dart says too many renters are being evicted for landlords' problems. Sheriff Thomas J. Dart said earlier he is suspending foreclosure evictions in Cook County, which includes the city of Chicago. The county had been on track to reach a record number of evictions, many because of mortgage foreclosures. Many good tenants are suffering because building owners have fallen behind on their mortgage payments, he said Thursday on CNN's \"American Morning.\" \"These poor people are seeing everything they own put out on the street. ... They've paid their bills, paid them on time. Here we are with a battering ram at the front door going to throw them out. It's gotten insane,\" he said.  Watch Dart slam mortgage companies \u00bb . Mortgage companies are supposed to identify a building's occupants before asking for an eviction, but sheriff's deputies routinely find that the mortgage companies have not done so, Dart said. \"This is an example where the banking industry has not done any of the work they should do. It's a piece of paper to them,\" Dart said. \"These mortgage companies ... don't care who's in the building,\" Dart said Wednesday. \"They simply want their money and don't care who gets hurt along the way. \"On top of it all, they want taxpayers to fund their investigative work for them. We're not going to do their jobs for them anymore. We're just not going to evict innocent tenants. It stops today.\" Dart said he wants the courts or the state Legislature to establish protections for those most harmed by the mortgage crisis. In 1999, Cook County had 12,935 mortgage foreclosure cases; in 2006, 18,916 cases were filed, and last year, 32,269 were filed. This year's total is expected to exceed 43,000. \"The people we're interacting with are, many times, oblivious to the financial straits their landlord might be in,\" Dart said. \"They are the innocent victims here, and they are the ones all of us must step up and find some way to protect.\"  Watch sheriff announce he won't evict innocent tenants \u00bb . The Illinois Bankers Association opposed the plan, saying that Dart \"was elected to uphold the law and to fulfill the legal duties of his office, which include serving eviction notices.\" The association said Dart could be found in contempt of court for ignoring court eviction orders. \"The reality is that by ignoring the law and his legal responsibilities, he is carrying out 'vigilantism' at the highest level of an elected official,\" it said. \"The Illinois banking industry is working hard to help troubled homeowners in many ways, but Sheriff Dart's declaration of 'martial law' should not be tolerated.\" Dart was undeterred Thursday. \"I think the outrage on my part with them [is] that they could so cavalierly issue documents and have me throw people out of homes who have done absolutely nothing wrong,\" Dart said. \"They played by all the rules. \"I told them, 'You send an agent out, you send somebody out that gives me any type of assurance that the appropriate person is in the house, I will fulfill the order.' iReport.com: How hard have foreclosures hit your neighborhood? \"When you're blindly sending me out to houses where I'm coming across innocent tenant after innocent tenant, I can't keep doing this and have a good conscience about it.\"", "da1ade89ae49419b905fc4e933ee460c3852a363": "(CNN) -- In India he's an icon and to the rest of the cricketing world he's simply known as one of the greatest ever batsmen. One the game's greats, Sachin Tendulkar is more than just a player in India, he's an icon. Sachin Tendulkar picked up a bat at the age of 4 in Mumbai and from that day on fell in love with the game. \"The only thing that was on my mind was, 'I want to play for India one day,' and I was pretty sure and confident that one day I will,\" he told CNN in Mumbai. In fact he made his Test debut for India at the age of 16 facing Pakistan's fearsome bowling attack, just two years after making his first-class debut for Mumbai. Despite a baptism of fire in that first international match and getting hit on the mouth by a ball from Waquar Younis, he took his own game forward and has become known for the positivity of his play and the compact efficiency and brilliance of his shot-making. Making his first Test hundred at the age of 17 against England he has racked up the records in a 19-year career. In 2000 he became the first batsman to score 50 international hundreds, and is the highest scorer in One Day internationals. He joined an elite group in 2007 when he became only the third player to pass 11,000 runs in Test cricket. Nicknames in cricket are common, but only if you're a really exceptional player do you get one that's complementary. Tendulkar has joined that elite as the \"Little Master\" which sits nicely next to other great batsmen, Viv \"Master Blaster\" Richards and Brian \"The Prince\" Lara. But perhaps no higher praise came from Australian cricketing legend Donald Bradman who once said that Tendulkar was the only player that reminded him of himself. Like all sportsmen he's suffered from injury, and now 35-years-old, many are wondering if his best days are behind him. Playing for India against England and Australia last summer and at the beginning of 2008, many commentators thought that his normal aggression and daring were missing from his game. His form was also heavily criticized after the 2007 World Cup, and injury forced him out of the international series against South Africa. But for the man used to batting away tricky deliveries, this criticism gets a typical positive response: \"I'm not one to dwell on the past. I like to move forward and these challenges, these hurdles in between, they bring the best out of me. They motivate me even more.\" He's currently facing the challenges of the rapid-fire version of the game in the Indian Premier League (IPL), masterminded by Lalit Modi, that despite it's glitz and hype has been criticized for losing some of the finer points of the sport. \"It's so full of excitement. I personally don't feel that it's dumbing-down the game. It's just another version of cricket. If the game is going to be globalized in the form of IPL, then why not? It's better for cricket,\" he told CNN.", "b6f63616e69f57fe43d0f4181343c229228fb1a2": "(CNN) -- A professor who compared some victims of the al Qaeda attack on the World Trade Center to Nazis was fired Tuesday by the University of Colorado's Board of Regents. Professor Ward Churchill wrote that some 9/11 victims were \"little Eichmanns.\" Ward Churchill raised hackles with a 2002 essay that argued the September 11, 2001, attacks were a justified reaction to U.S. policies in the Middle East, and said the hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania had \"the courage of their convictions.\" But the regents said Churchill's firing was unrelated to the essay, which went largely unnoticed for three years. Instead, it cited \"deliberate and repeated research misconduct.\" A university investigation had found cases of plagiarism and falsification in previous papers by Churchill -- allegations that surfaced after his essay became widely known. \"The Board of Regents affirms that its decisions in this matter have been made solely on the basis of the allegations of research misconduct against Professor Churchill and have not been influenced or motivated by extrinsic considerations, Professor Churchill's political and social views or a desire to punish Professor Churchill for expression of his political or social views,\" the university announced. CU interim Chancellor Phil DiStefano recommended Churchill's dismissal in June 2006 after a university committee completed its investigation. Churchill's essay drew little notice until a 1,800-student college in upstate New York invited him to take part in a 2005 forum on prisons and Native American rights. The invitation was rescinded after criticism from then-New York Gov. George Pataki, then-Colorado Gov. Bill Owens and hundreds of relatives of those killed in the attacks created a media firestorm. The piece had called some of those who died in the World Trade Center \"little Eichmanns\" -- a reference to Adolf Eichmann, the Gestapo officer who was one of the chief architects of the Holocaust -- arguing they were \"a technocratic corps at the very heart of America's global financial empire.\" Churchill, who had tenure, stepped down from his post as head of CU's ethnic studies department amid the flap but remained on staff.

Officials said this is the largest recall in the United States, surpassing a 1999 recall of 35 million pounds. Keith Williams, a U.S. Department of Agriculture  spokesman, said investigators have found no cases of illness related to the recalled meat. But Dick Raymond, the undersecretary of agriculture for food safety, said there was a \"remote probability\" that the meat from the Westland/Hallmark Meat Packing Company in Chino, California, could cause illness in humans. The amount of beef -- 143 million pounds -- is roughly enough for two hamburgers for each man, woman and child in the United States. The largest U.S. meat recall before Sunday came in 1999, when about 35 million pounds of product possibly contaminated with listeria were ordered off shelves. USDA officials said that was Class I recall, involving a known risk to human health. Sunday's action was a Class II recall, under which authorities say there is little risk of illness. Raymond said cattle that had lost the ability to walk since passing pre-processing inspections were slaughtered without an inspector having examined them for chronic illness -- a practice he said violated federal regulations and had been going on for at least two years.  Watch video of cows being abused \u00bb . Federal regulations are aimed at preventing the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE -- the scientific name for \"mad cow\" disease. It's important to keep downed cattle out of the food supply because they also may pose a higher risk of contamination from E. coli or salmonella because the animals tend to wallow in feces and have weaker immune systems, according to AP. Raymond said the average age of the cattle involved is 5-7 years, meaning they were likely born long after a 1997 ban on ruminant feed, and that the incidence of BSE in U.S. cattle is \"extremely rare.\" \"We do not know how much of this product is out there at this time. We do not feel this product presents a health risk of any significance,\" he said. \"But the product was produced in non-compliance with our regulations, so therefore we do have to take this action.\" About 37 million pounds of the meat went to school lunch programs and other federal nutrition programs since October 2006, said Ron Vogel, of the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service. The recall dates back to February 1, 2006, and Raymond said \"the great majority\" of the meat has probably been eaten already. USDA officials have begun tracing the products covered by the recall, he said. \"A lot of this is fresh, raw product and with ground beef, etcetera, that has a very short shelf life and refrigerator life,\" he said. Most of the beef was sent to distribution centers in bulk packages. The USDA said it will work with distributors to determine how much meat remains, the AP reports. In January, the Humane Society of the United States accused Westland/Hallmark of abusing \"downed\" cattle, releasing video that showed workers kicking cows, jabbing them near their eyes, ramming them with a forklift and shooting high-intensity water up their noses in an effort to force them to their feet for slaughter. Federal inspectors halted operations at the plant earlier this month after finding \"clear violations\" of USDA regulations. California prosecutors on Friday announced animal cruelty charges against two former employees of the plant. In a statement issued February 3, Westland Meat President Steve Mendell said the company was cooperating with the USDA and called the practices depicted in the humane society video as \"a serious breach of our company's policies and training.\" \"We have taken swift action regarding the two employees identified on the video and have already implemented aggressive measures to ensure all employees follow our humane handling policies and procedures,\" Mendell said.

Jessie L. Dotson, who was recently released after serving 14 years in prison for murder, was captured Friday night. He faces six counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Cecil Dotson, his 30-year-old brother; Hollis Seals, 33; Shindri Roberson, 20; Marissa Rene Williams, 26; and two children, said Memphis Director of Police Larry A. Godwin at a news conference Saturday. Dotson will also be charged with the attempted murder of three other children -- ages 7, 4 and 10 months -- who received stab wounds and blunt force trauma, Godwin said. Dotson's brother Cecil was the father of all the children, The Associated Press reported. Those who survived the attack were under police custody at a hospital, according to the AP. The March 2 killings followed an argument between Jessie and Cecil Dotson, Godwin said. Jessie Dotson shot his brother dead and went on to kill the others to try to cover up the crime, he said. \"[Dotson] thought everyone in the home was dead,\" Godwin said. \"But as we all know, by the grace of God, three children had survived.\" Prosecutors said they are considering seeking the death penalty against Dotson.

John McCain and Barack Obama, some Republicans admit that the Democrats may have outmaneuvered them on the issue. Sen. John McCain has sided with President Bush on opposing a popular GI Bill in Congress. McCain has defended his opposition to the bill that would expand education benefits for veterans, saying it would hurt the military that he hopes to lead. The bill, which passed the Senate last week 75-22, would expand education benefits for veterans who served at least three years in the military after the September 11, 2001, attacks. A former Navy officer and prisoner of war during Vietnam, McCain says the bill would hurt military retention by 16 percent and be a disincentive for service members to become noncommissioned officers, which he called \"the backbone of all the services.\"  Democrats cite the Congressional Budget Office, whose figures say the expanded benefits would boost enlistment by 16 percent. Watch more of McCain's comments \u00bb . \"I think John McCain has been outmaneuvered,\" said GOP strategist Ed Rollins, who had served as former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's presidential campaign chairman. \"Sometimes in politics, there are intellectual issues and emotional issues.\" \"John McCain is going against veterans groups; he is going against a constituency that should be his. ... But I think he is on the wrong side of this issue,\" Rollins said. \"A lot of Republicans are voting for this, and I think to a certain extent as it moves forward there will be more and more. There will be tremendous pressure from veterans groups past and present and I think you will see a lot of bipartisan support for this as well.\" Over the weekend, Obama, who appears to be the likely Democratic nominee, again tried to tie McCain to Bush by noting that both of them oppose the GI Bill expansion. \"I revere our soldiers and want to make sure they are being treated with honor and respect,\" Obama said Saturday in Puerto Rico. \"I think the GI Bill is one way for us to do that, and I hope that John McCain and George Bush decide they believe the same thing.\"   Watch more of Obama's comments \u00bb . Obama hasn't served in the military. \"It is really probably Barack Obama's shining moment in this campaign. The way he phrased this debate, the way he framed the issue,\" said Robert Zimmerman, a Democratic superdelegate who supports Sen. Hillary Clinton's run for president.  Watch analysts weigh in on the issue \u00bb . \"Intellectually, John McCain may be right, the president may be right. Emotionally, you are on the wrong side, you can never win an emotional battle in an intellectual argument,\" Rollins added. Rollins also said that despite McCain's war hero status, history has shown veterans who run for president don't always capture the veteran vote. \"I think the bottom line here in the statistic that was astonishing to me is George Bush's father was a war hero lost the veterans' vote to Bill Clinton who ... did not serve in a war,\" Rollins said. \"Same way with Bob Dole, a war hero lost the vote.\" McCain, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Richard Burr of North Carolina, has introduced an alternative bill that would increase education benefits on a sliding scale based on an individual's years of service. The GI Bill was created in June 1944, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944. It was designed to help educate and train military veterans returning from WWII. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, 7.8 million of 16 million troops who served in WWII received educational or vocational training from the GI Bill. Soldiers, Marines and airmen, speaking at a Capitol Hill rally on April 29, said they are not given enough funds from the bill to cover college expenses as they were promised. Todd Bowers, who served two tours in Iraq, told a crowd of veterans, \"I came home proud, very proud of my service, with a Purple Heart on my chest and a Navy commendation medal with a 'V' for valor.\" \"But I didn't come back to the education I was expecting. I came back to three different types of student loans, two of which had gone to collections.\" Najwa McQueen said she joined the Louisiana National Guard in 2004 on what she thought was a promise to help pay for her college education. \"They kind of sell you a dream,\" she said after the rally. \"You think you're going to get all of this stuff, and in reality, you don't get that.\" CNN's Ed Hornick, Alexander Marquardt, Ed Henry, Eric Marrapodi, Mary Snow, Deirdre Walsh and Robert Yoon contributed to this report.", "9f48f21f5b0ce4eb621c6837106743a4d9b8f402": "AMSTETTEN, Austria (CNN)  -- Josef Fritzl, who Austrian police say has confessed to imprisoning his daughter for 24 years and fathering seven of her children, twice holidayed in Thailand while she remained trapped in a cellar below his house, according to German media reports. Josef Fritzl appeared in court after admitting raping his daughter and fathering her seven children. Germany's Bild newspaper quoted a holiday companion, identified only as Paul H, who said he and 73-year-old Fritzl traveled to Thailand together twice and spent time in each other's homes. \"He went [to Thailand] without his wife; apparently she had to look after the children. ... Once he had a very long massage from a young Thai girl at the beach. He really loved that,\" Paul H told the newspaper, which featured video of Fritzl laughing and receiving a massage in Thailand on its Web site. \"Once I saw how Josef bought an evening dress and racy lingerie for a very slim woman in Pattaya [Thailand] on the beach. He got really angry when he realized I saw him. Then he told me that he has a girlfriend on the side. The items were meant for her. He told me not to tell his wife.\"  Watch footage of Fritzl on vacation at a Thai beach resort \u00bb . The pair had also ventured to Oktoberfest. Paul H said he had visited Fritzl's house three times, the last in 2005. \"We sat out on the terrace and had a really nice evening. ... The kids were well-behaved, however; they had a great respect for their father. They were never allowed downstairs into the cellar, but we never thought anything of it,\" he told Bild. \"Now that I think of the dungeon down there, I feel really sick in the stomach.\" Paul H said Fritzl was a DIY \"genius,\" constantly extending and building on to the house. Meanwhile, family members at the center of the incest and imprisonment case have held an \"astonishing\" reunion, medical officials said. \"They met each other on Sunday morning,\" clinic director Berthold Kepplinger said Tuesday. \"And it is astonishing how easy it worked, that the children came together, and also it was astonishing how easy it happened that the grandmother and the mother came together.\" Investigators say Fritzl held his daughter, Elisabeth, captive in a cellar for 24 years. He raped her repeatedly, they say, and eventually fathered seven of her children. Elisabeth and two of her children were reunited Sunday with three of her other children and her mother, Kepplinger said Tuesday. The three children and her mother lived in the home above the cellar. Elisabeth's eldest child, 19-year-old Kerstin Fritzl, remains in hospital. A seventh child died years ago, shortly after birth. Fritzl told police he burned the infant's body in a furnace. The story of the family's imprisonment began to unravel a week ago, when Kerstin fell seriously ill with convulsions and was hospitalized. Austrian police Wednesday denied reports that they were investigating possible links between Fritzl and the unsolved murder of a woman. Franz Polzer, director of the Lower Austrian Bureau of Criminal Affairs, said Fritzl had owned an Austrian hotel near where a woman was found murdered decades ago. However, they were not investigating the incident at this stage. Meanwhile, an Austrian girl who was held prisoner in a basement for eight years said the family faced a long period of adjustment.

Pulling them abruptly out of this situation, without transition, to hold them and isolating them to some extent, it can't be good for them.\" Officials said Tuesday that DNA testing had confirmed Fritzl fathered the children. His DNA also was found on a letter sent to the Fritzl family that was made to look like it was from his daughter, Elisabeth, Polzer said.  See inside the 'House of horrors' \u00bb . Authorities said Fritzl sent other letters over the years, leading the family to believe that Elisabeth was a runaway who had abandoned three of her children on their doorstep. He dictated at least one of the letters to his daughter, they said. Authorities said it did not appear that Fritzl's wife, Rosemarie, knew about her husband's activities. Reports have surfaced in The Times of London and Austria's Presse that Fritzl was convicted of sexual assault in the 1960s, but there is nothing in his record to confirm this, said District Governor Hans Heinz Lenze. He added, however, that records were expunged after a certain number of years. Prosecutors were checking archives to find the information, said Gerhard Sedlacek, prosecutor for the state of Poelten. The Times of London quoted a 50-year-old neighbor who said that when he was 10, he remembered \"how we children were afraid to play near Mr. Fritzl's house because of the rumors that he had raped a woman and spent some time in jail for it.\"  Watch a report of how the case unfolded. \u00bb .

The father, who police described as an authoritarian figure, forbade anyone from entering the cellar. In the cellar with Elisabeth were Kerstin and two sons, aged 5 and 18. E-mail to a friend .

But why was this particular date chosen, and how does this holiday differ from Memorial Day? Origins of Veterans Day . World War I, also known as \"The Great War,\" was fought from 1914 to 1918. During this conflict, Great Britain, France, Russia, Belgium, Italy, Japan, the United States and other countries, which formed the \"Allies,\" defeated the so-called \"Central Powers,\" which included Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey (then the Ottoman Empire) and Bulgaria. On the \"eleventh hour, of the eleventh day, of the eleventh month\" of 1918, German leaders signed an armistice, or a halt to hostilities, with the Allied powers. On that date, November 11, celebrations were held in New York City, Paris, London and in other cities around the globe. The following year, President Woodrow Wilson declared November 11 as \"Armistice Day,\" a day to observe the end of World War I. On June 4, 1926, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution asking President Calvin Coolidge to call upon officials to \"display the flag of the United States on all government buildings on November 11 and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies of friendly relations with all other peoples.\" Twelve years later, on May 13, 1938, Congress passed an Act making the 11th of November Armistice Day, a federal holiday. Initially, Armistice Day was supposed to honor veterans of World War I. But after the call to arms and human sacrifices during World War II and the Korean conflict, veterans' groups urged Congress to consider a day to celebrate U.S. veterans of all wars. On June 1, 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower signed a bill changing Armistice Day to Veterans Day. Difference between Veterans Day and Memorial Day . Veterans Day in the United States is a day to honor all Americans who have served in the U.S. military, both during wartime and in peace. Memorial Day is a day for remembering and honoring Americans who have died serving the nation, especially those who died in battle or from wounds received during armed conflicts. On Veterans Day, Americans thank the living veterans for their service to the country and recognize all who have served the country. Veterans Day Proclamation . The following is the text of President George W. Bush's 2008 Veterans Day Proclamation: . On Veterans Day, we pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of the men and women who in defense of our freedom have bravely worn the uniform of the United States. From the fields and forests of war-torn Europe to the jungles of Southeast Asia, from the deserts of Iraq to the mountains of Afghanistan, brave patriots have protected our Nation's ideals, rescued millions from tyranny, and helped spread freedom around the globe. America's veterans answered the call when asked to protect our Nation from some of the most brutal and ruthless tyrants, terrorists, and militaries the world has ever known. They stood tall in the face of grave danger and enabled our Nation to become the greatest force for freedom in human history. Members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard have answered a high calling to serve and have helped secure America at every turn. Our country is forever indebted to our veterans for their quiet courage and exemplary service. We also remember and honor those who laid down their lives in freedom's defense. These brave men and women made the ultimate sacrifice for our benefit. On Veterans Day, we remember these heroes for their valor, their loyalty, and their dedication. Their selfless sacrifices continue to inspire us today as we work to advance peace and extend freedom around the world. With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service members have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor America's veterans. NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2008, as Veterans Day and urge all Americans to observe November 9 through November 15, 2008, as National Veterans Awareness Week. I encourage all Americans to recognize the bravery and sacrifice of our veterans through ceremonies and prayers. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the United States and to support and participate in patriotic activities in their communities. I invite civic and fraternal organizations, places of worship, schools, businesses, unions, and the media to support this national observance with commemorative expressions and programs.

Crane wreckage lies on Manhattan's Upper East Side on Friday in a photo by iReporter Michael Schuman. Acting Buildings Commissioner Robert LiMandri announced the suspension, in effect until Monday, and unveiled a $4 million plan to assess high-risk construction activities, including crane operations, and make recommendations to improve safety. \"This year we have seen an increase in accidents and injuries related to high-risk construction activities,\" LiMandri said. \"We must make sure that as construction activity in the city continues to increase, the department's ability to hold the construction industry to higher safety standards keeps pace.\" Friday's accident was the second deadly crane collapse in the city in less than three months. Seven people were killed and 24 were injured in March when a construction crane toppled, plowing through several residential buildings. Crane operator Donald Leo, 30, died in the initial collpase Friday morning. Construction worker Ramadan Kurtij, 37, died Friday afternoon of cardiac arrest after being rushed to the hospital. Another construction worker remained critically injured, a city official said. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the cranes in the two incidents were different types. \"Two crane collapses in a short period of time look like a pattern, but there's no reason to think that there's any real connection,\" he said. On a radio program Friday, Bloomberg vowed that an investigation would be conducted and changes would be made if necessary. \"I don't need any developer or union leader or anybody else telling me about the consequences of slowing things down,\" he said. \"Nobody wants this economy to grow more than me. But we're not going to kill people.\" The accident happened shortly after 8 a.m. Bridget Barrett, who lives two buildings away, said she was just leaving for work. \"We heard a loud crash as I was walking down my stairwell. I went to the front door of the building, and it was all white smoke everywhere,\" she said. \"The crane had fallen in the middle of the street and was on fire. There was water spewing out of the apartment building all over the place.  And I dialed 911.\"  See photos from the scene of the collapse \u00bb . Witnesses said the cab and the arm of the crane crashed more than 20 stories to the ground, smashing the penthouse on a building across the street and gouging chunks out of balconies all the way to the ground. \"It sounded like a large metal structure slowly falling on itself, sounded like a prolonged car accident,\" said iReport contributor Daniel Miranda, who lives a block away. \"Construction workers were peering over the edge. Some of them were crying out in grief.\" A pedestrian had minor injuries, Bloomberg said at a news conference, adding that nearby buildings with about 160 apartments were evacuated \"strictly as a precaution.\"  Watch how latest crane collapse raises questions \u00bb . The collapse occurred a day after a building inspector rescinded a partial stop-work order that had been issued April 24. The order was issued after an inspection found that employees had been working without a permit and operating a crane in an \"unsafe manner,\" according to the city's Building Department. No other details were available. The collapse left a pile of wreckage at the foot of the Azure, an apartment building under construction at the northwest corner of East 91st Street and First Avenue, a mainly residential area on the city's Upper East Side. The falling crane also damaged the Electra, a 20-plus-story building on the southwest corner.  See where the crane fell \u00bb .

It looked like the crane had broken into three or four large pieces. I saw water pouring out of one of the apartments,\" Schuman said. Florence Diamond, a bus driver who was approaching the corner when the accident happened, said the crane's operator appeared to have been in the cab when the rig fell.  Watch as Diamond describes what she saw \u00bb . \"I just saw all the crane come down in the middle of the street. It was like something out of a movie,\" Diamond said. \"I couldn't believe the crane had fell, and I also saw the guy that was operating the crane go down with it. It was just one guy.\" Appearing at news briefing with Bloomberg, New York Gov. David Paterson said that \"we're going to have to take a look at all these crane accidents.\" \"There's no need to speculate now on how this happened.  That will all be investigated,\" he said. \"But certainly, these types of accidents are all too frequent.\" Barrett said she had worried about construction sites since the March crane disaster. \"It's just kind of baffling that this happened again,\" she said. \"I've seen that crane for the past couple months, and of course I thought about, 'What if it fell on my building or buildings around me?' I just kind of dismissed it because [I thought] there's no way that could happen after it had already happened once,\" she said. A construction worker at the site identifying himself only as Anthony said he didn't know what happened Friday, but he called it \"a scary thing.\" \"Everything goes through your head when you start seeing things like that happen,\" the worker said. \"You think about your family, your wife, your kids.

African Union peacekeepers keep guard recently at the international airport in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital. \"Any plane which uses or lands at the airport, we will consider it a military plane and we will not be held responsible for what happens to it,\" the Al-Shaabab militia said in a Web posting. The statement said the airport would be closed at 1 a.m. Tuesday (6 p.m. ET Wednesday). The statement was posted on www.kataaib.net, a Web site frequently used by Al-Shaabab. A graphic posted along with the statement shows a plane about to land at Mogadishu's international airport. As the plane approaches, a man with a shoulder-fired missile appears and a red-circle target is placed over the plane. The Somali word for \"Warning!\" flashes at the same time. Nairobi, Kenya-based Daallo Airlines, which operates flights four times a week into Mogadishu, is \"monitoring the situation,\" the company's chief executive officer told CNN. \"We haven't received any warning directly,\" Howard Leedham said. He said he was made aware of Al-Shaabab's warning through the local media, and would not say if any of the four weekly flights would be canceled or rescheduled as a result. \"All I can say is we're monitoring the situation very closely,\" Leedham said. \"We have employees down there, and so we're monitoring the situation.\" Maj. Barigye Ba-Hoku, a spokesman for African Union forces in Somalia -- many of whom are based at Mogadishu's airport -- said he has not received an official warning from Al-Shaabab about the airport's closure, but \"we take the warning seriously.\" \"We have taken precautionary measures, but that's all we can do,\" Ba-Hoku told CNN. Al-Shaabab is an Islamic militia that has launched a bloody battle to seize control of Somalia and oust Ethiopian forces, which are helping Somali government forces try to rout the Islamic fighters. It is a splinter group of the Islamic Courts Union, which pushed out Somalia's transitional government in 2006. The ICU was deposed in December of that year following Ethiopia's military intervention. In its statement, Al-Shaabab said it has been forced to shut down the airport because it is being used by a variety of \"infidel forces,\" including Ethiopia, Burundi, and Uganda. Burundi and Ugandan forces make up the bulk of the AU mission in Somalia. Al-Shaabab also said U.S. and Israeli security officials \"regularly\" land at the airport. \"So based on all these issues, we -- Al-Shaabab fighters -- are notifying all business people in Mogadishu, particularly to those of the airlines, that the airport is officially closed from the date on 16th September,\" it said.

Congress voted to override President Bush's veto of a $300 billion farm bill. The Senate voted 82-13 to override the president's veto of the bill Thursday, a day after the House voted 316-108 to override the veto. Both override votes exceeded the two-thirds majority required by the Constitution. A portion of the bill, however, remains in legal limbo. Before the House override vote Wednesday night, lawmakers discovered that the version sent to the White House last week was missing a part. The discovery raises questions about whether that section of the bill, which dealt with authorized trade and food aid, would become law. The discovery of the missing section, \"Title III,\" prompted concerns from House Republicans that the override vote was improper. Democrats said the matter stemmed from a clerical error. But Republicans pounced on the \"fiasco,\" which they said would require a temporary extension of the current farm bill. \"What's happened here raises serious constitutional questions -- very serious,\" said Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio. \"I don't see how we can proceed with the override as it occurred.\" However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that the override votes in both chambers of Congress would allow the sections of the bill that were sent to the president to become law. \"So, the farm bill minus Title III would be enacted\" after the override votes, Pelosi said. \"But I'm optimistic that we will be able to get Title III as well, either on its own or by sending the full bill again.\" \"Obviously, we want the complete bill. But ... we have obviously consulted with those who are expert on the Constitution and congressional action and presidential signatures, vetoes and overrides.\" In order to start the process of Title III to become law, the House passed the entire farm bill again Thursday by a vote of 306-110. It is unclear what the Senate will do. It could pass the entire bill again, as the House did, or it could pass the portion not sent to the president as a free-standing bill. Two-thirds of the $300 billion in spending for the farm bill would go for nutrition programs such as food stamps. Another $40 billion would go toward farm subsidies, and $30 billion is allocated for payments to farms to keep land idle and other environmental programs. After vetoing the farm bill, Bush said it \"continues subsidies for the wealthy and increases farm-bill spending by more than $20 billion, while using budget gimmicks to hide much of the increase.\" The president said it would hurt efforts to improve American farmers' access to overseas markets. Congress has passed one bill over Bush's objections: a $23 billion water-project legislation that the president vetoed in 2007.

Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil addresses the media after a cabinet meeting with PM Manmohan Singh. The fallout from the attacks is damaging the tenuous relationship between India and Pakistan, said CNN's sister station in India, CNN-IBN. The Indian government is considering suspending the five-year-old cease-fire with Pakistan and perhaps even ending the dialogue process with the country, sources told CNN-IBN. Pakistani security officials told CNN that if tensions with India escalate, Pakistan may shift its military forces from the Afghan border east to prepare for any conflict. The 60-hour wave of violence began Wednesday night as gunmen surged into at least nine locations in Mumbai, killing at least 183 people and wounding about 300. The official death toll does not include at least 11 gunmen killed in battles with security forces. Authorities have said that some of the attackers, who arrived in Mumbai by boat, were from Pakistan. \"Yes, the captured terrorist was Pakistani, as the home minister and others have said. As far as the others, the accomplices, the investigation, the interrogation is under way and the details will become public very soon,\" said Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister of Maharashtra. Pakistan's foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, vowed Saturday to take action against any group within its borders if it is found to be involved with the attacks. Interpol had said it would send a delegation to India to aid in the investigation. But on Sunday, the international law enforcement agency was still waiting for official permission into the country, a spokesman said. \"We believe that time is of the essence in Interpol's getting to India in order to explore any potential international links with regard to the seized evidence as well as the fingerprints and DNA of the suspected terrorists,\" a statement said. The resignation of India's home minister could also slow down the agency's being allowed into India, the statement said. Officials say they found telephones and a global navigational device on an abandoned boat floating off the coast of Mumbai that was used by the terrorists, CNN-IBN reported. The television network showed photographs of a phone's call log that revealed calls had been placed to Pakistan. The boat had been hijacked, intelligence officials told CNN-IBN. Four crew members who had been on board were missing. The captain was found dead, face down with his hands bound behind his back. The targets of the attacks included luxury hotels packed with foreign tourists. The 105-year-old Taj Mahal hotel was the site of the attackers' final stand, as gunmen held hostages and refused to leave the facility.  Victims share their tales of survival and escape \u00bb . The chairman of the company that owns the hotel told CNN that the company had been warned about the possibility of a terrorist attack before the massacre. The hotel heightened security as a result, the chairman of the Tata Group and Taj Hotels, Ratan Tata, said in a taped interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN's \"GPS.\" There were indications, though, that the hotel had relaxed security before the attack. \"It's ironic that we did have such a warning and we did have some measures,\" Tata said. \"People couldn't park their cars in the portico where you had to go through a metal detector.\" \"But if I look at what we had -- which all of us complained about -- it could not have stopped what took place. They didn't come through that entrance,\" he said. \"They came from somewhere in the back. They planned everything,\" he said of the attackers. \"I believe the first thing they did, they shot a sniffer dog and his handler. They went through the kitchen, they knew what they were doing.\"  Watch the destruction left at the hotel \u00bb . The security response to the attacks has brought criticism and led to the resignation of Patil, the home minister. Patil, who had been widely criticized even before terrorists struck, submitted his resignation to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, a Home Ministry spokesman said. Singh accepted the resignation and immediately named Finance Minister P. Chidambaram to take over the Home Ministry post, according to a source in the prime minister's office. N. Ram, editor-in-chief of The Hindu -- a major Indian newspaper -- said Patil's departure was overdue. \"This man has been widely criticized for not being up to it and it was simply impossible that he could stay on after this,\" Ram said.

Police say the man's sign is the only McCain sign on a street full of Obama signs. Kenneth Rowles, 50, pleaded not guilty to the charge Monday, according to CNN affiliate WBNS. Bail was set at $10,000. Rowles told police he was sitting on his porch Saturday when a tan SUV pulled up and a black youth jumped out and ran toward his house, screaming, \"This is for Obama.\" He said another male was hanging out of the passenger window screaming the same thing. Rowles said he went inside, got his rifle and fired three shots to scare the youths away, according to a Warren Township police report. He told officers he believes that the men \"were the same two that have been destroying his McCain sign.\" Just hours before the shooting, Rowles called police and said that a car had stopped in front of his house and that a black male \"ran up and said something about Obama,\" according to the report, and \"damaged his sign again.\" One of the youths, 17-year-old Kyree Flowers, was shot in the arm, according to a police report.

Pondering his boats? Despite a softening of the super-yacht market, Roman Abramovich will likely keep his fleet. The industry has bucked trends of other sectors with massive growth in recent years, but, the current international financial woes mean the uber-rich are poised to leave the plain rich behind as the market tightens. With estimations that hundreds of billions, or even trillions, of dollars will be wiped from the assets of the world's wealthiest businessmen and women, the super-yacht industry is sure to be one market that suffers. Although it is reserved mainly for the wealthy, dire predictions for the super-yacht world should be of concern to many, given that Superyacht UK estimates the industry is worth more than \u00a3350 million and provides employment to over 3,500 people. So, could the credit crisis be enough to crunch the industry altogether? Superyacht UK's international development manager Tom Chant told CNN the answer was \"no\", but it could have an impact at the lower end of the market. Chant said there were some signs that demand was \"softening\" for smaller super-yachts -- boats in the range of 30 to 40 meters long and usually worth anywhere between \u00a31 million and \u00a35 million. \"There has been a softening of demand for smaller super-yachts. These people are usually immune to these sorts of things. But now, maybe it has finally filtered all the way to the top,\" he said. The softening in this area of the market could also affect re-sale prices, which until now had been very stable, he said. The lower to middle market received a further blow recently when UK super-yacht building company Devonport Yachts, announced its closure. However, at the other end of the scale, things aren't looking so worrisome. Recent figures suggest that the top end of the super-yacht market is holding firm -- at least for now. A Super-yachting Index compiled by The Luxury Institute with yacht broker and charter company Camper & Nicholson's International, found that new orders for yachts over 130 feet are up nearly 20 percent in 2008. \u2022 See pictures of the world's top super-yachts . These figures continue a longer-term trend within the market. Last year there were 254 new orders for super-yachts over 130-feet, up from 134 orders in 2005. This increase is even more drastic when looking back a decade to 1997. Then, there were just 241 yachts longer than 80 foot being built across the globe. By 2007 this number had soared to 916 vessels. Chant said the credit crisis wasn't an issue for the attendees of the Monaco Yacht Show in September. \"At the Monaco show we had the first news of the credit crunch really hitting then. People didn't really raise an eyebrow,\" he said. And despite the weakening in the lower end of the market, Chant said the 60 meter-plus category was still \"very strong\", with most of the build slots at major ship-builders still full. So, it seems likely the super wealthy owners such as Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, Microsoft's Paul Allen, and Oracle's Larry Ellison should be shielded. There's no greater evidence of this than Roman Abramovich's latest project. Reportedly named the Eclipse, the super-yacht is expected to be about 160 meters long and become the biggest on the planet. Although no firm details have been released about the project, rumors have included a \u00a3250 million price tag, and the inclusion of two helicopter pads. However, not all super-yacht owners possess the fortune Abramovich does, and those without such giant financial backing may be forced to leave the market. Chant said some owners of smaller vessels may look to share ownership or charter their vessel out more often in order to maintain possession. \"Chartering is the big way to make money ...it is a good way to get some money back,\" he said. Tim Wiltshire, director and sales broker at international yacht company Burgess Yachts, said the chartering market was expected to stay reasonably strong, although it could be affected by people wanting to spend less money on holidays. \"We certainly haven't seen a crash. We are looking at people being more concerned about how they spend their money, so we may see a price realignment. \"But the demand will be there. There are plenty of people on the planet that want to go boating. Some people may not want to buy and may charter instead,\" he said. So, if the financial crisis doesn't worsen too much in the coming six months, the lower end super-yacht owners may yet be able to stay in the market.", "69c8bcf38432888dea021a938d38f2d7192fdb01": "TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- A Japanese food corporation has recalled five products after determining they contained the chemical melamine that has been blamed for the deaths of four children and sickening thousands of others. Officials stresses though that there were no reports of anyone becoming ill from consuming the sweets, which were made with ingredients imported from China, according to a representative of Tokyo's Marudai Food. The recall was issued several days ago. Tests found a ratio of 37 milligrams of melamine per kilogram of the products, the company said Friday. Japan is the latest country to report products tainted with melamine after thousands of Chinese children fell ill. The illnesses were traced to infant formula to which the toxic chemical had been added in Chinese dairy plants. Nearly 53,000 children in China have been sickened by the formula or other products containing melamine. Four babies have died, and five Hong Kong children have suffered melamine-related illnesses. Dozens of countries have banned or recalled Chinese milk products.  Watch how the scandal has spread beyond milk \u00bb . Hong Kong officials said Friday that a type of Heinz cereal and wasabi crackers were recalled after they were found to contain excessive melamine. Test results for another 40 samples of baby food are pending, said Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety. Earlier Friday, the maker of a widely distributed Chinese candy linked to the melamine scandal said it would stop selling the confection in China. The manufacturer, Guanshengyan, had already recalled exports of White Rabbit Creamy Candies, and food-safety authorities worldwide have pulled them from shelves. On Thursday, the European Union joined authorities worldwide in banning the import of Chinese milk products for children. Chinese authorities have arrested 18 people in a nationwide investigation. They include two brothers who face charges of selling contaminated milk; the brothers could face death if convicted, according to China Daily, a state-run newspaper.  Watch Chinese government reaction \u00bb . The raw milk used to produce powdered baby formula had been watered down, and the chemical melamine was added so it would pass quality checks, the newspaper said. Adding melamine makes a product seem to have a higher protein level. Melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants.

Joe Biden about whether Sen. Barack Obama's policies were Marxist. WFTV-TV anchor Barbara West tells Larry King  she was doing her job as a reporter when she interviewed Sen. Joe Biden. Critics said WFTV-TV anchor Barbara West of Orlando had an agenda and was asking biased questions. Biden responded, \"Is this a joke?\" CNN's Larry King on Monday talked with West about the interview on \"Larry King Live.\" Larry King: Your recent grilling of Joe Biden has stirred up a lot of controversy. Let's take a look at part of it, and we'll get your comments. Watch. [Video clip begins]  Watch as West interviews Biden \u00bb . Barbara West: You may recognize this famous quote. \"From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.\" That's from Karl Marx. How is Sen. Obama not being a Marxist if he's intending to spread the wealth around? Sen. Joe Biden: Are you joking? Is this a joke? West: No. Biden: Or is that a real question? West: That's a question. Biden: He is not spreading the wealth around. He's talking about giving the middle class an opportunity to get back the tax breaks they used to have. I know this has been a pretty mean campaign. I was on a television station the other day and doing a satellite feed to a major network in Florida. And the anchor quotes Karl Marx and says in a sense, \"Isn't Barack Obama Karl Marx?\" You know I mean folks, this stuff you're hearing, this stuff you're hearing in this campaign, some of it's pretty ugly. [Video clip ends] . King: All right, Barbara, what were you getting to, since generally the redistribution of the wealth is a graduated income tax? West: Well, Larry, no, I don't believe that it is just a graduated income tax. I think a lot of people who are talking to me out on the street are saying they are very, very concerned that this idea of redistributing the wealth means taking it out of somebody's pocket who is a wage earner and putting it in somebody's pocket who refuses to work. And they're asking about. That's what they don't want. That is what they want to know, what does this really mean? My job as a journalist is to ask those questions and get those answers, and I don't believe I got answers at all. King: Was the implication in the question that Barack Obama is a Marxist? West: I was asking him to tell us about how Barack Obama's redistribution of wealth was different from that quote by Karl Marx, that's all I wanted to know. ... I'm not here to debate the issues. I am not a political pundit. ... I'm a journalist.  Watch as West defends her questions \u00bb . And I -- my job is to ask tough, probing questions of the candidates. I had a very short time to be able to do that, only about four minutes. There were issues that I wanted to cover, including the issues about ACORN and the abuses that they've done with voter registration, particularly here in Florida, and Florida is such a key state. And also this issue of the redistribution of wealth, as well as Sen. Biden's comments about \"You mark my words, in six months, Barack Obama will be tested.\" King: I got you. West: But it was his caveat afterward that was the issue that I was questioning, and that is it may not be readily apparent as to what, as to whether or not the actions or whatever he does are in fact the appropriate ones. And so America, stand with him and trust him. King: I got you. West: I just wanted answers to those questions. King: The Orlando Sentinel reports that you are registered as a Republican; your husband is a Republican strategist. Is that true? West: Let me correct that. My husband did do consulting for the Republican Party back in the Clinton administration, and he also worked for Sen. Paul Wellstone, who was a very liberal Democrat at the time, and they were working together to shape the media message as far as the sex slave trade was concerned. He was sent by the Clinton administration to go to Europe and also South America to consult with local officials who were perceived as friends of America in fighting the war against drugs.", "f483941144f0abdb9bb37d05c025cd6b0f37c957": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- In their first head-to-head debate, Sen. John McCain criticized Sen. Barack Obama as a candidate who \"doesn't understand\" the key issues the country faces, and Obama linked McCain to President Bush on several issues. \"I'm afraid Sen. Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy,\" McCain said Friday as the two traded jabs over Iraq. Obama shot back, \"I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.\" McCain drew from his experience overseas as he tried to portray himself as the more qualified candidate. \"Incredibly, incredibly Sen. Obama didn't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with Gen. [David] Petraeus,\" he said.  Watch McCain, Obama talk about fighting in Iraq \u00bb . McCain slammed Obama for not supporting the surge, an increase of about 30,000 troops to Iraq in early 2007. Bush sent the additional troops as part of a campaign to pacify Baghdad and its surrounding provinces. \"John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007,\" Obama shot back. \"You talk about the surge. The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong.\" Watch entire debate:  Part 1 \u00bb |  Part 2 \u00bb |  Part 3 \u00bb . Obama repeatedly criticized the Bush administration and charged that McCain is an endorser of his policies.  See scenes from the debate \u00bb . In describing his tax plan, Obama said, \"over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.\" Obama also said the economic crisis is the \"final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Sen. McCain.\" Both candidates squeezed in a few cheap shots. Obama brought up McCain's jokingly singing a line about bombing Iran, and McCain jabbed Obama for his short-lived \"presidential seal.\" Immediately after the debate, both campaigns issued statements declaring their candidate the winner. Grade the candidates' performance in the debate . \"This was a clear victory for Barack Obama on John McCain's home turf. Sen. McCain offered nothing but more of the same failed Bush policies, and Barack Obama made a forceful case for change in our economy and our foreign policy,\" said Obama-Biden campaign manager David Plouffe. \"John McCain needed a game-changer tonight, and by any measure, he didn't get it,\" he said. iReport.com: Who do you think won the debate? McCain's campaign said \"there was one man who was presidential tonight; that man was John McCain.\" \"There was another who was political; that was Barack Obama. John McCain won this debate and controlled the dialogue throughout, whether it was the economy, taxes, spending, Iraq or Iran. There was a leadership gap, a judgment gap and a boldness gap on display tonight, a fact Barack Obama acknowledged when he said John McCain was right at least five times,\" communications director Jill Hazelbaker said. Full coverage of the debates . During the first 30 minutes of the debate, the candidates focused on the economy, even though the debate was supposed to be centered on foreign policy. For a while, it seemed like the debate might not even take place, because McCain said he would not show up unless Congress came to an agreement on the government's proposed $700 billion bailout plan. McCain said Friday that enough progress has been made for him to attend the debate, even though Congress has not made a deal. Here's a snapshot of what the candidates said. On government spending: . McCain said he would consider a spending freeze on everything but defense, veterans affairs and entitlement programs in order to cut back on government spending. Obama disagreed, saying, \"The problem is, you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. \"There are some programs that are very important that are currently underfunded,\" Obama said. He agreed that the government needs to cut spending in some areas, but he said other areas, such as early childhood education, need more funding. McCain repeated his call to veto every bill with earmarks.  Watch the candidates spar over earmarks \u00bb . Obama said the country \"absolutely\" needs earmark reform but said, \"the fact is, eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we are going to get the middle class back on track.\" On the bailout proposal: . Obama said that the United States was facing its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. McCain said he was encouraged that Republicans and Democrats were working together to solve the crisis. Obama refused to be pinned down on whether he would support a $700 billion plan proposed by President Bush's top economic advisers, saying the final details of the proposal were not known. McCain said he hoped to be able to vote for it. On the likelihood of another terrorist attack: . McCain that another attack on the scale of the September 11 hijackings is \"much less likely\" now than it was the day after the terrorist attacks. \"America is safer now than it was on 9/11,\" he said, \"But we have a long way to go before we can declare America safe.\" Obama agreed that the United States is \"safer in some ways\" but said the country needed to focus more on issues such as nuclear non-proliferation and restoring America's image in the world. On relations with Russia: . Obama called for a re-evaluation of the United States' approach to Russia in light of the country's recent military action in the Caucasus. \"You cannot be a 21st-century superpower and act like a 20th-century dictatorship,\" he said. McCain accused Obama of responding naively to Russia's invasion of neighboring Georgia last month by calling on both sides to exercise restraint. McCain said he would support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in NATO. On Iran: . McCain said Iranian nuclear weapons would be an \"existential threat to the state of Israel\" and would encourage other countries in the Middle East to seek nuclear weapons as well. \"We cannot allow another Holocaust,\" he said. Obama agreed that the United States \"cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran,\" calling for tougher sanctions from a range of countries including Russia and China. McCain called for a new \"league of democracies\" to stand firm against Iran. On Iraq: . McCain said the next president will have to decide when and how to leave Iraq and what the United States will leave behind. The Republican candidate said that the war had been badly managed at the beginning but that the United States was now winning, thanks to a \"great general and a strategy that succeeded.\" \"Sen. Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq,\" McCain said. Obama responded, \"that's not true; that's not true.\" He blasted McCain as having been wrong about the war at the start, saying McCain had failed to anticipate the uprising against U.S. forces and violence between rival religious groups in the country.  Watch Obama tell McCain he was 'wrong' \u00bb . \"At the time when the war started, you said it was quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were,\" Obama said, citing the key White House policy justifying the 2003 invasion. \"You were wrong. You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong,\" he said.", "7464a7ac138866a3d9b63035c623eb0495b07b61": "(CNN) -- Two fishermen remain missing after a commercial fishing vessel went down in frigid, treacherous waters off the Aleutian Islands about 1,400 miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska. The fishing vessel Courageous helps search for missing men in waters off Alaska. A search for the two crew members of the 93-foot Katmai resumed at daybreak Friday. An e-mail sent by the doomed fishing boat to a nearby vessel said it was taking on water in the rear, where the steering was housed, the Coast Guard told The Associated Press on Thursday. Four of the boat's crew members were rescued and five bodies retrieved Wednesday near the Amchitka Pass, a strait that connects the Bering Sea to the Pacific Ocean. The names have been withheld pending the notification of families, a Coast Guard statement said. \"What can you say?\" said Jeff DeBell, chief financial officer of Katmai Fisheries, which owned the boat. He told The AP, \"We are devastated by what has happened. We are elated there have been survivors. We are just terribly saddened by the ones that are dead and are praying that those that are still in the water are alive.\"  Watch rescue footage from the choppy waters \u00bb . The Seattle-based company told the AP the survivors were Capt. Henry Blake and crew members Guy Schroeder, Adam Foster and Harold Attling. The search began at about 1 a.m. Wednesday when the Coast Guard received an emergency signal from the Katmai, a 93-foot fishing vessel that had been battling 50-knot winds and nearly 20-foot waves. The signal originated from a wall-mounted satellite positioning device on the Katmai that reacts when it's touched or splashed with water, Coast Guard Petty Officer Levi Read said.  Watch a \"Deadliest Catch\" captain talk about what may have happened on the rough seas \u00bb . At about that time, another vessel, the Blue Balard, sent an e-mail to the Coast Guard saying that it received a message from the Katmai that water was flooding its rear compartment. The message also said that the vessel had lost steering. The Coast Guard tried to e-mail the Balard back but received no response, likely because the seas are remote and Internet access can be spotty, Read said. Rescuers launched a C-130, a long-range surveillance aircraft, and went straight to the scene twice Wednesday morning, Read said. The boat was nowhere in sight, but the C-130 did spot two strobe lights on top of the water, he said. By this time, the weather was treacherous and the sky was darkening, according to Read. The C-130, having found no signs of life, dropped two life rafts and headed back, he said. On the second trip, at 11 a.m., the C-130 and a Jayhawk helicopter found two strobe lights floating in the water, one attached to a survival suit and the other to the emergency device that had first alerted the Coast Guard, Read said. They also found a body, he said. \"We knew the person was from the Katmai because the suit he was wearing had the name of the vessel on it,\" Read said. Roughly five hours later, the Coast Guard spotted four men on a life raft, all wearing survival suits. With the assistance of other vessels, the Courageous and the Patricia Lee, the bodies of four other men were recovered from the water, all wearing survival suits, Read said. The odds of someone surviving the frigid waters off Alaska's Aleutian Islands is minimal, said Read. Crews usually have survival suits that allow water to seep inside but have a mechanism that traps body heat. The search for the two remaining men began at 9:30 a.m. Alaska time Thursday, an hour before sunrise there. \"You just couldn't do anything earlier,\" Read said. \"It's darker the farther out you go, and they are really, really out there.\"", "260c5b6d8462a56ad394a51e8f9f986f23d116a9": "(CNN) -- The fourth and final suspect in the fatal shooting of two Arkansas university students turned himself in Monday, University of Central Arkansas police said. The first suspect was apprehended while driving about three minutes after the Sunday night shooting. The others were detained later, said Lt. Preston Grumbles. The suspects were identified as Kawin Brockton, 19; Kelsey Perry, 19; Mario Toney, 20 and Brandon Wade, 20. Police released little details on the suspects other than the fact that they were not university students. \"It does not seem at this time that it was a random act,\" he said, but police are \"unsure of the precise motive.\" He said there was \"no indication\" the shooting was gang-related. University police released the names of the victims Monday. Ryan Henderson, 18, of Little Rock, Arkansas, and Chavares Block, 19, of Dermott, Arkansas, were killed. Block was a sophomore pre-engineering major. Henderson was a freshman who had not yet declared a major.

A hospital representative earlier told CNN that the survivor was shot in the leg. \"This is something you pray never happens,\" interim university president Tom Courtway said, visibly upset. \"But it happened.\" The shooting, which happened outside a dorm, prompted a campus lockdown and the cancellation of Monday classes. Courtway said classes will resume Tuesday.  Watch police describe the shooting \u00bb . The shots were fired near Arkansas Hall and the Snow Fine Arts Center at 9:22 p.m., Swindle said. Freshman Sam Hausen, who was about 50 feet (15 meters) away from the shooters when the gunfire began, said, \"I heard about five or 10 shots and, at first, I thought it was just firecrackers, because everybody always clowns around out there, but I just realized that it wasn't firecrackers.\" As he began running away, he saw one of the wounded students hit the ground and another stumble into the dorm, he said. \"I saw a couple cars speed off,\" Hausen said. \"I don't know if they were the shooters or not.\" Student Lauren Knight, who was walking to the library when the shooting started, said students scurried for safety. When the campus lockdown was ordered, Knight was stuck with other students for several hours inside the library, she said.

Police say the man's sign is the only McCain sign on a street full of Obama signs. Kenneth Rowles, 50, pleaded not guilty to the charge Monday, according to CNN affiliate WBNS. Bail was set at $10,000. Rowles told police he was sitting on his porch Saturday when a tan SUV pulled up and a black youth jumped out and ran toward his house, screaming, \"This is for Obama.\" He said another male was hanging out of the passenger window screaming the same thing. Rowles said he went inside, got his rifle and fired three shots to scare the youths away, according to a Warren Township police report. He told officers he believes that the men \"were the same two that have been destroying his McCain sign.\" Just hours before the shooting, Rowles called police and said that a car had stopped in front of his house and that a black male \"ran up and said something about Obama,\" according to the report, and \"damaged his sign again.\" One of the youths, 17-year-old Kyree Flowers, was shot in the arm, according to a police report. He and the second youth, Patrick Wise Jr., 16, told police they were in the car attempting to leave when Rowles fired at them. \"Kyree stated that he witnessed the homeowner trying to shoot Patrick but he was having trouble chambering a round,\" the police report said. The teens admitted that they had defaced the McCain sign several times, Warren Township police Lt. Don Bishop told CNN. Rowles' is the only McCain sign on a street full of Obama signs, he said. Bishop said the teenagers probably will not be charged -- and are unlikely to damage campaign signs again, as the incident scared them.

Greenwashing expert Scot Case of TerraChoice . \"Why are green products often more expensive than ones that don't say they are green or environmentally friendly? Is it just because green has become a new form of 'premium brand'? Isn't this bad news if we want to make more people environmentally aware when they go shopping?\" Harriet Gladwell . Case: First, it should be noted that not all greener products are more expensive. The remanufactured toner cartridges I purchase at a nationwide office-supply store, for example, carry the same warranty as other cartridges at a 30-percent lower cost. This greener option is less expensive because the manufacturer avoids the cost of manufacturing the plastic and electronic components. They simply reuse the parts from recycled cartridges. There are also greener products that do not cost extra. There are cleaning products and paints, for example, that have been certified as meeting tough environmental standards by EcoLogo or Green Seal that deliver the same high-quality performance one expects without costing any extra. Other greener products might be slightly more expensive initially, but generate substantial savings for the consumer. Energy-efficient compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs), for example, are still four times more expensive than traditional cheap incandescent light bulbs. However, CFLs use 75 percent less electricity and last 10 times longer, so they don't have to be replaced as frequently. As a result, the typical CFL saves consumers $30 over the life of the bulb. There are now energy- or water-efficient versions of all sorts of products -- refrigerators, windows, air conditioners, televisions, dishwashers, ovens, showerheads, washing machines, etc. The more efficient versions are typically more expensive initially to reflect the higher-quality components used to make them, but they quickly pay for themselves in lower energy and water costs. Look for products that are Energy Star registered. Even better, look for products that have been independently certified as meeting the Energy Star standards. Why are other greener products still more expensive sometimes? It boils down to the simple laws of supply and demand. Any new innovative product, whether it is \"greener\" or not, costs extra initially. It costs money to research and develop the product and to build the factories and supply chains it takes to make the product. Manufacturers try to recoup those costs as quickly as possible during the initial sales of the product. As demand increases, however, additional manufacturing efficiencies -- economies of scale -- begin to emerge that permit the prices to fall. In addition, high prices attract competitors with similar products, and the additional competition helps force prices lower. Are some manufacturers attempting to earn additional revenue by presenting their greener options as a premium brand? Absolutely. Just as some clothing manufacturers charge extra to have their name brand applied to a shirt. It is also possible, however, to buy high-quality, greener products, at very good prices, at growing numbers of mainstream retail outlets. When DVD players and cell phones were first introduced, they were only available to the very wealthy. Now everyone has at least one. The same is increasingly true with greener product offerings. \"What are the most obvious signs that a company is greenwashing the public with false claims? What words and phrases should raise a red flag?\" Carla Dos Santos . The most obvious sign a company is greenwashing is if the company fails to provide proof of their environmental claims. Legitimate environmental claims can be certified by independent outside third-party auditors. Manufacturers can also provide test data and other relevant information on Web sites. Consumers should also beware of generic environmental claims that are so vague they are likely to be misunderstood. Watch out for broad claims like \"eco-friendly,\" \"earth kind,\" \"all natural,\" \"eco-safe\" or other green babble. Even phrases like \"biodegradable,\" \"recyclable\" and \"compostable\" can be misleading if they fail to clarify how the products were tested or under what circumstances the claim is true. Make sure any environmental claim is specific, backed by proof, and, preferably, verified by an independent, outside third-party. For additional greenwashing examples and recommendations on how to avoid being fooled, check out the Six Sins of Greenwashing or the accompanying wallet-size guide book. \"Is it possible to put together information about a product's greenness that has both the detail that's really needed, and is at the same time simple and clear? And how can we get governments to serve the public and advise them on green purchasing, in the way that is most fair to commercial interests?\" Rick Reibstein . There are certainly efforts underway to provide consumers with additional information about the environmental impacts of their purchasing decisions. The traditional environmental standards such as Green Seal and EcoLogo publish standards and then certify products meeting those standards. Most consumers find the simplicity of this type of certification scheme the most useful. Some particularly savvy green consumers, however, want additional information beyond knowing that a product has been certified as meeting a standard. They are seeking information presented in a nutrition-label format that allows them to compare two certified products to determine which is greener. I think we will see the emergence of hybrid labeling systems that do provide greater detail about the environmental features of a product. Such a label would combine the traditional \"thumbs up or thumbs down\" approach of Green Seal or EcoLogo along with additional information in a standard format. The information might be available on product packaging or on an accompanying Web site. Governments are actually already pushing manufacturers to provide this level of detail using their purchasing power rather than their legislative power. Government purchasers across North America, for example, are demanding safer, more environmentally preferable cleaning products, papers, paints, vehicles, building products, office equipment and computers. Government purchasers in New York, Illinois, California, Minnesota, and other places, for example, require cleaning products to meet the Green Seal or EcoLogo cleaning-product standards. As a result, those products are becoming more widely available for consumers too. The U.S. Federal government and many state governments are also purchasing more environmentally preferable computer products. They are requiring products to meet the EPEAT green computer standard. One unique feature of the EPEAT label is that the EPEAT Web site provides additional information on the environmental features associated with the almost 1,000 products on the EPEAT registry. Now that the information is available, consumers can use the EPEAT information to make their own purchasing decisions. Providing this level of environmental information is the foundation of market-based environmentalism. Government purchasers, other large purchasers such as colleges and universities or Fortune 1000 companies, and individual consumers can use the publicly available information about the environmental impacts of their purchasing decisions along with traditional factors like price and quality to determine how they will spend their hard-earned money. This approach allows the greenest products to be identified and to compete with other products for market share. Of course, in addition to the market-based approach, governments always have it within their power to actually legislate minimum environmental requirements or the publication of basic environmental information. There are persistent rumors of efforts underway to use the legislative power of the federal government to encourage greater transparency regarding the environmental footprint of a product and to make it easier to share that information with consumers. It will be interesting to see what happens in Congress with a new U.S. president in January. \"How can we know if the 'green' label is credible, and do you think we'll ever get to the place where all these different certifications merge into one consistent and widely recognized label? Is this happening in any countries?\" Amber Wells . While there were only three or four eco-labels 20 years ago -- EcoLogo was North America's first and it was founded in 1988 -- there are now more than 300. At some point, I think it is inevitable that there will be some significant consolidation in the environmental-labeling world. There are already numerous meetings among the most legitimate environmental-labeling programs to collaborate more closely. A variety of efforts are attempting to separate the truly green labels from the fake green ones. There are also persistent rumors of pending federal legislation to encourage or even require greater accountability. Until then, consumers need to be aware that not all green-labeling programs are created equally. Before relying on any \"green dot\" to help make a purchasing decision, consumers need to understand exactly what the \"green dot\" means. Make sure you can answer the following questions about an environmental label before making a purchase: . (1) Who created the labeling program? -- Was it created by a manufacturer or a trade association to promote their own products, or was it created by an independent outside organization in an open, public, transparent process? Is it backed by a respected European or North American government? (2) Does the label require a product to actually meet a specific standard? -- Some labels are being awarded based on fees paid to a consultant rather than based on compliance with a published standard. Others are being awarded simply by joining a trade association or paying a membership fee. (3) Does the label address multiple environmental issues or does it focus narrowly on just a single issue like energy-efficiency or recycled-content? -- Review the standard to determine whether it covers multiple environmental issues throughout the entire product life-cycle, which includes the raw materials used to make the product, the manufacturing process, transportation and packaging, and the impacts of using and discarding or recycling the product. Make sure the standard covers the environmental issues you and the environmental community are most concerned about. (4) What does a manufacturer have to do to prove a product meets the standard? -- Some labels permit a manufacturer to determine on its own whether it meets the published standard. Other programs -- including EcoLogo, Green Seal, and the Chlorine Free Products Association -- independently review product test data and visit the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the standard.

The monarchist groups say the kingdom was overthrown and annexed into the United States illegally. Hawaii's office of the attorney general did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on Wednesday's action. The staff of Iolani Palace, built in 1882 and now operated as a museum, shut down the building to visitors. The 60 or so protesters occupied the grounds, chaining the gates and stationing guards there to explain to visitors the purpose of the action. The group later reopened the gates, but remained on the grounds and the building was kept closed. \"It saddens my heart to have to turn away visitors,\" said palace staff member Cindy Ascencio, who added that although she is a native Hawaiian, she does not understand the actions of the group. Ascencio also said the group appeared peaceful and she was not concerned about security. Jose Carrion, a visitor to Hawaii from Puerto Rico, told Honolulu's KHON-TV that he was disappointed he wouldn't be able to visit the ornate palace and \"learn about the culture of the Hawaiians.\" \"We wanted to come here precisely because we thought we'd learn something about the history of Hawaii and the last queen and the monarchy,\" said Carrion, who said he had reservations for the visit. \"But we're leaving tomorrow, so we won't get to see the palace.\" Carrion also said he \"kind of understood\" the actions of the group. Puerto Rico and Hawaii, along with Guam and the Philippines, were annexed into the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. Guam and Puerto Rico remain territories of the United States. The Philippines gained independence after World War II, and Hawaii became the 50th state in 1959. Although the monarchy was not overthrown until 1893, its fate effectively was sealed six years earlier when the same group that forced the overthrow imposed a new constitution on King David Kalakaua, who was forced to sign it under threat of arms. The document dramatically reduced the authority of the monarchy and instituted voter requirements that limited voting to wealthy businessmen and Hawaiian landowners, barring 75 percent of the native Hawaiian population and all Asians. When Queen Lili'uokalani ascended the throne after the death of her brother in 1891, she began work on a new constitution that would have effectively reversed the 1887 document. With the help of John L. Stevens, the U.S. minister to Hawaii, the elite group that had changed the constitution in 1887 opposed the queen's actions. Two years later, under threat of U.S. troops, she yielded her authority, saying, \"Until such time as the government of the United States shall ... undo the action of its representative and reinstate me in the authority which I claim as the constitutional sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands.\" The queen was later imprisoned in Iolani Palace for eight months for her participation in an attempted 1895 revolt, until she relinquished her claim to the throne in return for her release. She died in 1917 at 79. In 1993, the U.S. Congress approved, and President Bill Clinton signed, an apology to the people of the Hawaiian islands. The document \"acknowledges that the overthrow of the kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States and further acknowledges that the native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum.\" Although it was used as a seat of government for decades after Lili'uokalani's reign, the palace fell into disrepair. When the last of the government offices moved out and into new facilities adjacent to the palace in 1969, restoration work began. It opened to the public in 1978.

Asashoryu is one of sumo's most successful, and most controversial, wrestlers. But the 330-lbs Mongolian, sumo's most successful ever grand champion, has not been able to rise above the scandals and tragedies that have beset Japan's national sport in recent years. Asashoryu, whose real name is Dolgorsuren Dagvadorj, grew up in Mongolia, where both his elder brothers and father were successful wrestlers. Moving to Japan as a student he was spotted and trained by the Takesago stable and made his professional debut at the age of 18 in 1999. Winning his first tournament, or basho, in 2002, his rise up the rankings culminated in him attaining the highest position of Grand Champion, or yokozuna, in January 2003, becoming only the 68th yokozuna in the sport's 2,000-year-old history. Two years later, he set a new record by being the only man to win all six official tournaments in one year. While Asashoryu's meteoric rise to the top was seen by many as reinvigorating a sport that had seen a decline in homegrown wrestlers and popularity, his success in the dohyo has not pleased everyone. Some have complained that his wins are too routine, and purists grouse that he does not poses the quality of \"hinkaku,\" the dignity and calm expected in a yokozuna, or give the sport's traditions the necessary respect. In 2003 he was disqualified from a bout for pulling on the top-knot of an opponent, and has gained a reputation as the enfant-terrible of sumo. Regardless of the criticisms of Asashoryu's wrestling style, sumo's reputation as a noble sport of tradition has suffered from a number of scandals in recent years and exposed it as just as susceptible to the problems faced by other sports. With deep links to Japanese culture going back to when sumo was part of the Shinto religious rituals, the sport's troubles have almost represented a national identity crisis. Following the banning of three non-Japanese wrestlers for using recreational drugs in September, the sport's chairman and former-wrestler Kitanoumi resigned. It came after a period of years in which a number of match-fixing allegations were made, some directly implicating Asashoryu, and plunging the sport into yet another crisis. In January 2007 he was accused of bribing other wrestlers to lose bouts, compounding the view that corruption was prevalent in the sport. Problems for Asashoryu continued in 2007 when he was suspended by the sumo wrestling federation for allegedly faking a doctor's note and was restricted from leaving his house in Tokyo, leading to reports of a nervous breakdown. Mental as well as physical strength are necessary to reach the top of the sport, but while the punishing physical routine and \"hazing\" in the training stables has been known and accepted, tragedy struck earlier this year. Takashi Saito, a 17-year-old sumo trainee, died in brutal circumstances, allegedly beaten to death by his stable-master and three fellow sumo wrestlers. Continuing to make his mark in the dohyo will be Asashoryu's aim for the rest of the year, while sumo hopes it can recover its own poise.", "83adc62a90edc904cc78cdebc2e32841e0714be9": "(CNN) -- Grammy Award winners Alicia Keys and John Legend will perform at \"CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,\" airing on Thanksgiving on CNN.

Thousands of displaced Congolese on Tuesday line the road near the Kibati camp north of Goma, Congo. \"Five rockets were fired on two U.N. armored personnel carriers that were part of the convoy of MONUC Blue Helmets near Kalengera,\" according to a report on the Web site of the U.N. Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, known by its French acronym, MONUC. \"MONUC reiterates that under its mandate it will continue to intervene with all of its means to ensure the protection of civilians and to protect the urban centers of North Kivu,\" MONUC said, referring to the province in eastern Congo. The attacks by rebels of the National Congress for the Defense of People, or CNDP, led civilians to seek refuge in Goma, the provincial capital, where national army forces surround the city, said MONUC spokesman Jean-Paul Dietrich. He said U.N. helicopters flew overhead to provide cover until darkness fell, when the aircraft were grounded for the night. Dietrich said a U.N. official in Goma reported that the town of Rutshuru had been captured, although he had not confirmed the information with the military. Rutshuru is a territorial capital about 37 miles (60 kilometers) north of Goma. The U.N. convoy that officials said was attacked was providing security on the road from Rutshuru. Dietrich said clashes between the rebels and government forces had taken place during the day in scattered locations. Bertrand Bisimwa, a spokesman for the rebels, told The Associated Press the rebels' front lines are within within 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Goma, a city of 600,000. U.N. refugee agency spokesman Ron Redmond said the Kibati camp for displaced persons tripled in size in a matter of hours Tuesday, The AP reported.

CNDP is not listening to anyone anymore,\" she said. Renewed fighting erupted Sunday when the CNDP, led by renegade Gen. Laurent Nkunda, seized a major military camp and gorilla park just one week after a U.N.-brokered peace accord, according to U.N. and park officials. The rebels, according to Wildenberg, are surrounding areas where displaced persons are housed as a \"strategy used to put more pressure on government and on the international community to get some of their requests satisfied. This is unacceptable and a violation of humanitarian law.\" Although the civil war in Congo officially ended in 2003, recent fighting in eastern Congo between government forces and rebels has displaced thousands. Fighting and the related humanitarian crisis have killed some 5.4 million people since 1998, and 45,000 people die there every month, according to an International Rescue Committee report in January.

The companies are aimed at an audience of African-American and urban consumers, and they own 53 radio stations in 16 cities, a cable network and a variety of Web sites. Liggins personally has contributed to Barack Obama's campaign. Alfred Liggins says the black population in America has grown increasingly diverse. (CNN) -- If you think African-Americans will come out in greater numbers than ever before to vote for Barack Obama, you're probably right. If you think you know how they'll vote in the almost 500 House, Senate and gubernatorial races, you could be in for a surprise. Although politicians and their advertising gurus often speak to Black America as a collective, homogeneous group, the black population is anything but a monolith. In the past decade, the more than 40 million strong black population in America has become increasingly diverse: economically, socially, technologically and even philosophically. In the final push toward Election Day, as politicians and political hopefuls seek to penetrate this community, they may no longer understand to whom they are speaking. Are they addressing blacks or African-Americans? Is racial prejudice as important an issue today as affording a college education for their kids or taking care of an aging parent? iReport.com: Black college cancels class to vote . Radio One, the country's largest broadcasting company primarily targeting African-Americans, recently commissioned a study to uncover Black America today. How do they identify themselves? What do they care about? How are they influenced? What is most important to them? Interestingly, the study found that 42 percent of those polled actually prefer to be called black (these are more likely to be more affluent) compared with 44 percent who choose to be described as African-American. And yes, it would be misguided to assume that dropping a Martin Luther King Jr. quote into a speech and focusing on America's history of racial inequality is the sure way to sway black voters when one-third of blacks, particularly younger people, believe that there is actually too much focus on past oppression. And as insulting as it is to assume that all women vote for female candidates, it is equally inaccurate and offensive to say that blacks simply cast their ballots for people of color. Like all Americans, black folks vote on the issues they care about, and today those issues are less likely to be linked to race than they are to the economy, health care, education and a whole spectrum of social issues. As Georgetown University sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson recently said, \"black people don't vote for candidates just because they are black. If Clarence Thomas ran for president, he would get five black votes.\" Given Black America's extreme diversity today (the study identified 11 specific groups) it is easy to misunderstand who they are and how they can be reached. Yes, discrimination and racial issues are still incredibly important, particularly to middle-age and older blacks. But the younger populations are more concerned about starting their own businesses, paying for their education, taking care of their children and creating a better work/life balance. So how do politicians penetrate the multiple segments of Black America? In 1992, when Bill Clinton wooed African-Americans in church, he understood how to effectively reach that population. But that was before social networking sites attracted millions of teenage and young black adults. Now that the digital divide has faded, with roughly the same percentage of blacks online as the general population, ignoring black Web sites and social networking sites would be a big mistake. Although the history of black oppression in America is not the radioactive issue it once was, trust in the community -- whom blacks trust -- is still paramount. Of all institutions, they are least likely to trust credit card companies but also remain seriously wary of the mainstream media and tend to trust black media more than traditional media outlets. It has been almost a century and a half since blacks in America won the right to vote. It makes all the sense in the world that the black community has evolved and diversified over the years, but too often politicians make the mistake of assuming that blacks are still a monolithic group fixated on all of the same issues. Though Barack Obama will be able to count on a massive percentage of the black vote on Election Day, the rest of the ticket will need to dig deeper than the canned speeches dealing with racial injustice of the past to satisfy today's black voters.

John McCain's attack against Sen. Barack Obama for Obama's willingness to meet with the Iranian president \"without precondition.\" Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger says he is not in favor of negotiations with Iran at the presidential level. Immediately after the debate, the McCain campaign released a statement from Kissinger backing the Republican nominee's sentiments on structuring any talks with Iran. \"Sen. McCain is right. I would not recommend the next president of the United States engage in talks with Iran at the presidential level,\" Kissinger said in the statement. \"My views on this issue are entirely compatible with the views of my friend Sen.

Both candidates referenced Kissinger's comments from a CNN forum last week in which former secretaries of state discussed several topics, including Iran, and the presidential candidates disagreed over what Kissinger had said. The exchange started with McCain criticizing Obama for stating in two previous debates that he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro \"without precondition.\" McCain, the Republican nominee, said that in the past, U.S. presidents such as Ronald Reagan refused to meet with adversaries until a Cabinet member, such as the secretary of state, had several talks. \"Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be preconditions,\" McCain said.

Obama responded by claiming that Kissinger, \"along with five recent secretaries of state, just said we should meet with Iran, guess what, without preconditions.\" McCain denied the claim: \"Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve a face-to-face meeting\" with Ahmadinejad. \"He did say there could be secretary and lower-level meetings.\" Obama defended his stance, explaining, \"Look, Sen. McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks. Nobody's been talking about that. Sen. McCain knows it. That's a mischaracterization of my position.\" He also said, \"I reserve the right as president of the United States to meet with anyone at the time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep the American people safe.\" He added that those talks would come after \"preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks.\" The forum last week -- \"The Next President: A World of Challenges\" -- was co-sponsored by CNN and hosted former secretaries of state Warren Christopher, Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, James Baker and Colin Powell. During the forum, Albright, who served in the Clinton administration, said, \"I believe we need to engage with Iran.\" Kissinger, who served in the Nixon and Ford administrations, echoed the sentiment. He said he is \"in favor of negotiation with Iran\" at the secretary of state level. \"I always believed that the best way to begin a negotiation is to tell the other side exactly what you have in mind ... what the outcome is that you're trying to achieve so that they have something that they can react to,\" Kissinger said.", "1554bafeeec9d379eb651a17f318e31b3d01003a": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Mexican authorities have detained the country's former drug czar on suspicion that he may have accepted $450,000 a month in bribes from drug traffickers, Mexico's attorney general said Friday. Noe Ramirez Mandujano was in charge from 2006 through August of fighting organized crime in Mexico. Noe Ramirez Mandujano was in charge from 2006 until this August of the attorney general's office that specializes in combatting organized crime. Ramirez is accused of meeting with members of a drug cartel while he was in office and agreeing to provide information on investigations in exchange for the bribes, Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora Icaza said at a news conference Friday. The arrest was part of an ongoing investigation called \"Operation Limpieza,\" or \"Operation Cleanup,\" the attorney general said. The operation targets officials who may have passed information to drug cartels. The arrest was announced Thursday night, four days after the house arrest of Ricardo Gutierrez Vargas, the director for International Police Affairs at Mexico's Federal Investigative Agency and the head of Mexico's Interpol office. Authorities say more than 30 officials have been arrested since July in connection with the anti-corruption operation. Interpol, which is based in France, announced Wednesday it is sending a team of investigators to Mexico to investigate the possibility that its communications systems and databases may have been compromised, a prospect raised by the arrest of Gutierrez, the top official working with the agency in Mexico. \"A war of master proportions\" between authorities and narcotics traffickers and traffickers among themselves has left more than 4,300 dead so far this year, according to the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, an independent research and information organization. By comparison, the council said in a report this week, there were 2,700 drug-related deaths in 2007. \"Homegrown drug cartels operating from both within and outside the country are engaging in a vicious turf war to seize control of major trafficking corridors while engaging in almost open warfare against the mobilized forces of the state,\" the council said about what it calls \"narco-fueled crime.\" Mexican leaders have been trying to tamp down the violence by tightening controls on money-laundering and cracking down on corruption among local and municipal police forces infiltrated by drug traffickers. It may not be enough. \"Due to pervasive corruption at the highest levels of the Mexican government, and the almost effortless infiltration of the porous security forces by the cartel, an ultimate victory by the state is far from certain,\" the Hemispheric Council concludes. Drug trafficking in Mexico is a $20 billion- to $50 billion-a-year industry, as much as the nation earns from tourism or remittances from Mexicans living in the United States, said Robert Pastor, a former National Security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and now a professor of international relations at American University in Washington. He has been studying Latin America for more than four decades. \"This is a huge industry with an extraordinary capacity to corrupt and intimidate the country. And they're doing both right now,\" said Pastor, also a former director of the Carter Center's Latin American and Caribbean Program. The drug cartels are paying some Mexican officials bribes of $150,000 to $450,000 a month, authorities have said. This in a country where the per capita income is $12,500 a year and one of every seven Mexicans lives in poverty, according to the CIA World Factbook.", "dc7774ef29c0f3438de72dea1712a14ee1aef699": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Zimbabwe urgently needs to form a new government in order to address a food crisis in the nation and prevent starvation, newly designated Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai told reporters Saturday. At least 80 percent of the population of Zimbabwe are living below the poverty line. Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, said there was a \"deepening food insecurity\" in the country. \"We need to respond to this crisis with utmost urgency,\" he said. \"It is therefore imperative that a government be formed in the next few days and begins to implement plans to insure that our people have food and do not die of starvation.\" Zimbabwe industries are operating at about 10 percent of capacity, and the food and manufacturing industry will not be able to deliver sufficient food supplies to markets. Tsvangirai signed a power sharing deal with President Robert Mugabe on September 15 but the two have not yet agreed on the distribution of Cabinet posts. Earlier this week, Mugabe told the press that only four posts were still to be agreed on. But Tsvangirai said in response, \"I think to minimize the remaining issues to only four issues, it is to underplay the whole process. The issue is that the negotiation must be concluded I think the matter will be solved once all the principals are back in the country.\" Mugabe has been in the United States for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. He is expected back in the country after Saturday. Zimbabwe has been facing a collapsing economy for nearly a decade, and is plagued with high unemployment, food shortages and at least 80 percent of the population living below the poverty line. This has been accompanied by dizzying levels of inflation -- now officially at 11.2 million percent, the highest in the world. Once an exporter of food, Zimbabwe has been a net importer of food since 2000, when Mugabe's government embarked on a controversial and violent land reform program that displaced some experienced commercial farmers, most of them of European origin. Tsvangirai said he has consulted with food security experts and was told the country needs to import 800,000 tons of maize (corn) to avoid starvation until the next harvest in April.", "2c13a432ca76474e2d0d65f94e108768daefb5a9": "(CNN)  -- Elvis Presley may have left the building three decades ago, but he raked in more money last year than many living titans of the music industry . Singer Elvis Presley tops the Forbes list for the second year in a row, raking in $52 million last year. For the second year in a row, Presley topped the Forbes magazine's list of Top-Earning Dead Celebrities, hauling in $52 million last year. In comparison, the very-much-alive Justin Timberlake earned $44 million while another superstar, Madonna, made $40 million, the magazine reported Tuesday. The 30th anniversary of Presley's death boosted attendance and merchandise sales last year at his Memphis, Tennessee, home, Graceland. A long list of licensing deals, such as a Presley show on satellite radio, added to the earnings. The business magazine has been compiling its annual list of departed celebrities' earnings since 2001. Since 2003, the feature has coincided with Halloween. This year, the top 13 celebrities earned a combined $194 million in the last 12 months. The magazine says it talked to people inside the celebrities' estates and calculated their gross earnings from October 2007 to October 2008. Some celebrities are staples on the list, which is in its eighth year. Cartoonist Charles Schulz, who created Snoopy, Charlie Brown and the assorted cast of \"Peanuts\" characters, is second on the list. Schulz, who died in 2000, had posthumous earnings last year of $33 million, the magazine reported. He owes his constant presence to a steady revenue stream from the ongoing licensing of his characters, the magazine said. Schulz and Presley join Theodor \"Dr. Seuss\" Geisel (this year's No. 6), Beatles legend John Lennon (No. 7) and actress Marilyn Monroe (No. 9) as the only entertainers to make the list every year since its inception. Physicist Albert Einstein, best known for his theory of relativity, is fourth on the list. It is his third consecutive year making the Forbes rankings. Though he died in 1955, a franchise bearing his name -- Baby Einstein -- made big bucks last year selling educational books, DVDs, CDs, toys and other products. It plans to expand into the young-adult market this year. Australian actor Heath Ledger, who died of an overdose in January, made his debut on the list in third place. The magazine estimated his earnings at $20 million, thanks to the success of the movie, \"The Dark Knight,\" in which Ledger played the Joker. The movie grossed $991 million worldwide. Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer last month, also made his first appearance on the list, raking in $5 million. \"His income still largely stems from residuals from his classic pictures, as well as more recent productions,\" the magazine said. The legendary actor's line of natural and organic food products, Newman's Own, earned revenues of $120 million last year, but the earnings were not considered in the tally because Newman donated all profits to charity while he was living, the magazine said. Several entertainers from last year's list failed to make this year's cut, including composer, producer and Beatles guitarist George Harrison, rapper/actor Tupac Shakur, \"Godfather of Soul\" James Brown, and reggae legend Bob Marley.", "21bf4e8709c7fe19855a20c8c398ce7d015b36f1": "(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the first of a new class of HIV drugs that attacks the virus in a different way. A woman wears an AIDS ribbon at a Cape Town, South Africa, hospital where HIV patients are treated. Isentress, developed by Merck & Co., is designed for patients who have shown resistance to current treatments. The drug has been approved for adults who already have been receiving treatment, but more testing is necessary before it is approved for new HIV patients or children, the company said in a statement. Isentress belongs to a class of drugs called integrase inhibitors. These drugs work by blocking the integrase enzyme, which helps HIV replicate by inserting its DNA into new cells. Isentress is the first drug in the class to win FDA approval. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a noted HIV expert and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said the FDA's approval \"will be most welcome in the community of physicians taking care of HIV-infected patients.\" \"Its mechanism of action is particularly important in that it blocks the ability of the virus to integrate itself into the genes of cells,\" Fauci said. \"This property of the virus to integrate is important in establishing the reservoir of virus in the body that has made it extremely difficult to eradicate HIV, even with prolonged treatment.\" Two earlier classes of anti-HIV drugs -- protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors -- also work by blocking different enzymes involved in HIV replication. Friday's decision by the FDA will give doctors a new tool to help patients who have developed resistance to existing drugs or who are infected with drug-resistant strains of HIV. Like protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors, Isentress will also be prescribed for patients in combination with other drugs to maximize the number of ways the virus is being attacked. The cost of the recommended daily regimen of Isentress -- a 400 mg tablet taken twice a day -- will be comparable to protease inhibitors, with a wholesale price of $27, Merck said.

President Bush didn't request intelligence reports about the post-war situation, the Senate panel's report says. The White House exploited its ability to declassify intelligence selectively to bolster its case for war, the committee chairman, Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-West Virginia, said in the report. Senior officials disclosed and discussed sensitive intelligence reports that supported the administration's policy objectives and kept out of public discourse information that did not, he said. The report also found that the administration misled the American people about contacts between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda. \"Policymakers' statements did not accurately convey the intelligence assessments\" about contacts between the then-Iraqi leader and Osama bin Laden's group, \"and left the impression that the contacts led to substantive Iraqi cooperation or support of al Qaeda,\" the report said. \"Statements and implications by the president and secretary of state suggesting that Iraq and al Qaeda had a partnership, or that Iraq had provided al Qaeda with weapons training, were not substantiated by the intelligence,\" according to the committee's exhaustive report on prewar intelligence. The top Republican on the committee dismissed its findings as \"partisan gamesmanship.\" \"It is ironic that the Democrats would knowingly distort and misrepresent the committee's findings and the intelligence in an effort to prove that the administration distorted and mischaracterized the intelligence,\" said Sen. Christopher Bond of Missouri. The White House also rejected the report as old news. \"I know this is another report, and I'm sure that they put a lot of considerable thought into it, but this is a subject that has been gone over many many, many times, and I don't know of anything that's particularly new in it,\" said spokeswoman Dana Perino, who said she had not yet read it. She said the White House relied on the same information as the rest of the world, admitting that it was wrong but denying that Bush had set out to mislead the country. White House claims that Hussein was seeking weapons of mass destruction were partially backed by available intelligence, the report found, but did not reflect disputes within the intelligence community. The CIA, among others, believed Iraq was trying to acquire nuclear weapons, but the Department of Energy disagreed, the report said. No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq after the invasion. The report also took the administration to task for its predictions about the aftermath of the invasion, including Vice President Dick Cheney's assertion that U.S. troops would be greeted as liberators. Bush and Cheney did not request intelligence reports about the post-war situation, and their public statements did not reflect doubts and uncertainties in the intelligence community, the report said. The report comes days after former White House press spokesman Scott McClellan published a book saying Bush decided on war with Iraq soon after the September 11, 2001, attacks. \"Bush and his advisers knew that the American people would almost certainly not support a war launched primarily for the ambitious purpose of transforming the Middle East. Rather than open this Pandora's Box, the administration chose a different path -- not employing out-and-out deception, but shading the truth,\" McClellan wrote in his memoir, \"What Happened.\" Current and former White House officials have dismissed McClellan's accusations, saying he was not in a position to know about top-level White House decision-making before the war when he was deputy press secretary. The Senate committee chairman slammed the White House in a statement marking the release of the long-awaited report. \"Before taking the country to war, this administration owed it to the American people to give them a 100 percent accurate picture of the threat we faced,\" Rockefeller said Thursday. \"Unfortunately, our committee has concluded that the administration made significant claims that were not supported by the intelligence. In making the case for war, the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated, contradicted or even nonexistent. As a result, the American people were led to believe that the threat from Iraq was much greater than actually existed,\" he added. The report picked apart three speeches by Bush, including his 2003 State of the Union address two months before the invasion, one by Cheney and then-Secretary of State Colin Powell's U.N. presentation about Iraq in the run-up to the war. The report was approved by a 10-5 vote, with some Republicans dissenting. Some GOP members of the committee had wanted the report to examine prewar statements by Democrats, including Sen. Hillary Clinton. Democrats on the committee blocked the suggestion and limited the report's purview to administration statements only.

The attack involved two car bombs, a spokesman for Yemen's embassy in Washington said. Six attackers, including a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest, were also killed in the attack, Mohammed al-Basha said. There were at least four explosions -- including at least one car bomb -- and sniper fire, a senior State Department official said. Yemeni officials said the first car contained people in police uniforms who exchanged fire with Yemeni security forces, the officials said. The second car exploded after it passed an outermost gate to the Embassy but before it reached a second protective barrier, the officials said. But al-Basha said there were two cars packed with explosives involved in the attack. The heavily fortified compound in the capital of Yemen -- the ancestral home of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden -- has previously been targeted in attacks.  Watch the aftermath of the attack \u00bb . A U.S. official told CNN the attackers initially opened fire outside the embassy's security gate, then there was the main explosion followed by a secondary explosion. At some point, snipers positioned across the street from the embassy opened fire on Yemeni first responders as they arrived on the scene, the official said. Those killed include six Yemeni policemen and four civilians, he said, noting that the number of wounded is unclear. No U.S. Embassy employees were killed, the official added. However, CNN affilliate WGRZ reported that Ahmed Elbaneh of Lackawanna, New York, said his sister, Susan, 18, and her new husband died in the attack. Elbaneh said his sister left Lackawanna about a month ago for an arranged marriage and that she had been married for only 30 days. Elbaneh said family members in Yemen told him she was at the embassy translating for her new sister-in-law when the blast occurred. Yemen believes al Qaeda is responsible for the attack, al-Basha said. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the the explosions \"bear the hallmarks of an al Qaeda attack.\" And Al-Basha said in a statement: \"The government of Yemen considers terrorism as a crime against humanity. It strongly condemns this heinous attack. Whoever else who may have planned, plotted and supported the perpetrators of this terrorist attack will be apprehended and justice will prevail.\" Media reports said Islamic Jihad in Yemen -- which is affiliated with al Qaeda -- has claimed responsibility for the attack, but CNN could not independently confirm those reports. The U.S. State Department said it is sending a team of law enforcement and security experts to help in the investigation, spokesman Sean McCormack said. Trev Mason, a British national who lives near the embassy, said he saw \"a massive fireball\" near compound.  Eyewitness tells of fireball outside embassy \u00bb . \"We heard the sounds of a heavy gun battle going on,\" he told CNN. \"I looked out my window, and we saw the first explosion going off -- a massive fireball very close to the U.S. Embassy. \"The gun battle went on for a further 10 to 15 minutes, followed by two further loud explosions.\" The first explosion happened about 9:15 a.m. Wednesday (0615 GMT/2.15 am ET) and was followed by several secondary blasts, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Ryan Gliha.  Gliha describes the aftermath \u00bb . Gliha was at the embassy at the time of the attack and said he felt the compound shake. \"We were all ordered to assume what we call a duck-and-cover position which is a position where we guard ourselves and bodies from potential debris,\" Gliha told CNN. \"From that vantage point, I can't tell you much after that except we did feel several explosions after the main explosion that shook the ground.\" Al-Basha called it a \"despicable and heinous act\" particularly because it took place during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. President Bush condemned the attack, and warned that it is \"a reminder that we are at war with extremists who will murder innocent people to achieve their ideological objectives.\" \"One objective ... is they will try to cause the United States to lose our nerve,\" he said. \"We want people to be able to live normal lives; we want mothers to be able to raise their sons and daughters.\" A senior State Department official told reporters Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in a phone call with Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh expressed regret for the loss of Yemeni life but also underscored the need to increase and improve cooperation against terrorism. Witnesses told CNN they heard gunfire, and said they saw ambulances rushing from the scene. The U.S. State Department has warned of violence that it attributes to Islamic extremists in Yemen. It has cited concern \"about possible attacks by extremist individuals or groups against U.S. citizens, facilities, businesses and perceived interests.\" The State Department ordered the departure of all non-emergency American staff from the Embassy, along with their family members, in April, after attacks against the Embassy and a residential compound. That order was lifted last month. In March, three mortar rounds landed near the Embassy, injuring Yemeni students at a nearby school and Yemeni government security personnel, the State Department said. The next month, an expatriate residential compound in the Hadda neighborhood was attacked by mortar fire. Suspected extremists fired two mortar rounds toward the Yemen Customs Authority and Italian Embassy in April, as well, but no one was hurt. Authorities in Yemen have been struggling to curb the activities of al Qaeda-linked groups, with militants seen as having free rein outside major cities, says CNN's International Security Correspondent Paula Newton.

Hemant Karkare, left, was killed by gunmen in Mumbai shortly after this video was taken Wednesday. According to accounts in Indian newspapers, Karkare, 54, was credited with solving many crimes and did his job apolitically and with the utmost integrity. \"The state Anti-Terrorism Squad has lost a daredevil officer in Hemant Karkare,\" Peter Lobo, chief inspector of the Anti-Terror Squad in Pune, told The Times of India on Thursday.

It would be the last video taken of Karkare before terrorists shot him three times in the chest near Cama hospital, the site of another Wednesday attack in Mumbai. \"Though a workaholic, he was a soft-spoken officer. ATS has received a severe blow because of the untimely death of Karkare,\" Lobo told The Times of India before departing Pune to pay his respects to Karkare. Karkare joined the Indian Police Services in 1982. He became head of Maharashtra's Anti-Terror Squad in January after he returned from Austria, where he served seven years in the Research and Analysis Wing, India's external intelligence agency. The post in Austria was testament to his acumen as a police officer, a colleague told The Times of India. \"Due to his excellent ability to handle things, he was posted to the Research and Analysis Wing in Austria. He was like family to me,'' said Bipin Gopalakrishna, who joined the force with Karkare in 1982. According to CNN-IBN, Karkare was credited with solving bombing cases in Thane, Vashi and Panvel and played a key role in cracking the case of the September 29 blast in Malegaon, which reportedly killed six people. He also uncovered several radical Hindu groups operating in Maharashtra, according to media reports. Karkare came under intense political pressure while investigating the Malegaon bombing, and it was widely reported that he warned officers in his command against succumbing to pressure to doctor evidence. \"We should do our job and it is for the court to decide,\" Karkare was quoted in several media outlets as saying.  Watch officials speculate on who may be responsible for this week's attacks \u00bb . \"He was simply superb.

Gaur told the paper he had worked with Karkare in Aurangabad and Nanded. Added another Indian Police Services officer: \"His death is a huge loss to our force and society.\" When not on the clock, Karkare was known to enjoy sculpting and could often be found whittling driftwood, The Indian Express reported. He also enjoyed music and dabbled in palm reading, former diplomat T.P. Sreenivasan told The Hindu. \"We used to put him in one of the stalls as an Indian palmist during the annual charity fair organized by the Indian ambassador and he was big hit with the crowd,\" said Sreenivasan, who worked with Karkare in Vienna for five years. Sreenivasan told The Hindu that Karkare -- who had strong credentials in fighting terrorism, corruption and money laundering -- could have earned a post at a U.N. agency in Vienna, but chose instead to return home to serve India. Karkare is well-admired, Sreenivasan told The Hindu, and is survived by a doting family and many friends and admirers. Contacted in Pune, Karkare's brother Shirish found it difficult to speak about his brother's death Thursday. \"He was a father figure for me,\" the younger brother told The Times of India. Shirish's wife Amruta told the newspaper that the anti-terror chief would be laid to rest when his daughters arrived from overseas.

Ex-first lady Barbara Bush has been moved out of ICU and into a regular room. Bush, 83, was in good spirits and was joking with hospital staffers, the Methodist Hospital spokeswoman said. She was being fed intravenously. Her doctor said earlier she will be allowed no food by mouth for about a week, to avoid possibly stretching her abdominal area. The former first lady showed up at Methodist's emergency room Tuesday night complaining of severe abdominal pain, Dr. Patrick Reardon, who performed the surgery, told reporters Wednesday. Doctors determined Bush had a perforated ulcer in her duodenum, the first portion of the small intestine after the stomach, he said. In the operating room, doctors thoroughly cleaned her abdominal cavity of any contaminants that had leaked through the hole, described by the hospital as being one centimeter in diameter. Then, doctors repaired the ulcer and sewed a piece of the fat tissue in the abdomen, on top of it to seal it, Reardon said. Bush's husband, former President George H.W. Bush, was with her Thursday morning, but was leaving to attend Thanksgiving dinner with his son Neil, the Methodist Hospital spokeswoman told CNN. The ulcer was biopsied and is benign, Reardon said Wednesday. He suggested it might have been caused by anti-inflammatory medications.

Manuela Testolini was in Mumbai on business when a series of brazen attacks broke out. At first, they didn't know what it was. Then, one of Testolini's colleagues saw a man get shot to death outside the restaurant's front door, and everyone started to run. \"We left everything behind, including purses and phones,\" said Testolini, the ex-wife of music icon Prince and founder of In A Perfect World children's foundation. \"There was a lot of panic.\" Testolini said gunfire followed her as she and dozens more fled through the kitchen and down to the ballroom, where they found temporary refuge from the gunfire and grenades raining outside.

Gunmen rampaged through a series of targets in the commercial capital of India, killing indiscriminately and taking hostages at two luxury hotels. Testolini said she and 200 others waited in the dark ballroom for several hours, listening to the intensifying sounds of gunfire and grenades. Eventually, the hotel staff began evacuating guests 10 at a time, women and children first, to the street. For a moment, she thought she was safe. But then, the gunfire returned. \"They were pursing us, and we ran, and we could hear them shooting at us,\" Testolini said.

BERNARD PARISH, Louisiana (CNN) -- \"We were a normal red-blooded American family,\" recalls Rudy Aguilar. \"And ... it took [one day] to wipe us out.\" Liz McCartney moved to St. Bernard Parish to help residents rebuild their homes after Katrina. A lifelong resident of St. Bernard Parish, a community just east of New Orleans, Aguilar lost everything during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Nearly three years later, like many in his area, Aguilar is still struggling to get back on his feet. But now he has help. From her home 1,000 miles away in Washington, Liz McCartney was haunted by images of the storm's destruction and stories of people like Aguilar. In February 2006, she and her boyfriend, Zack Rosenburg, went to New Orleans to volunteer. The experience changed their lives -- so much that they quit their jobs and moved to St. Bernard Parish. Now they're dedicated to helping people rebuild and move back into their homes.  Watch McCartney describe how the St. Bernard Project is rebuilding homes \u00bb . McCartney said that when she first arrived in St. Bernard Parish, she was stunned. \"We just wanted to pitch in and help out,\" McCartney, now 35, recalls. \"I naively thought that six months later, you'd see all kinds of progress. [But it] looked like the storm had just rolled through.\" St. Bernard Parish was once home to 67,000 residents, but Katrina left nearly all of the area's homes uninhabitable. As McCartney got to know the locals, she was reminded of her parents and grandparents. \"These were people who worked their whole lives, put their kids through college, and had never had to receive [help] before,\" she says. That's when she decided to do more to help the community recover. By June 2006, the couple had left Washington and moved to St. Bernard Parish. Neither knew anything about construction, but both felt they could use their experience raising money and organizing volunteers to help with the rebuilding effort. Local residents, touched by the couple's leap of faith, taught them basic construction. Within two months, McCartney and Rosenburg opened the nonprofit St. Bernard Project, which focuses on helping those they consider most in need -- senior citizens and families with children. The formula is straightforward: With donations, volunteers and skilled supervisors, homes get rebuilt -- and people move home. \"It's not rocket science,\" McCartney says. \"The problems in this community are widespread, but the solutions are really simple.\" Yet this simple equation yields impressive results. The St. Bernard Project can transform a gutted house into a livable home in just eight to 12 weeks for an average cost of $12,000. For residents like Aguilar, the St. Bernard Project has been a lifesaver. In the years since Katrina, he lost his job and struggled with health problems. \"I was so beaten down,\" he says. \"I was gonna blow myself away.\" When the Saint Bernard Project agreed to rebuild his home, the relief he felt was palpable. \"They saved my life.\"  Watch Aguilar describe his own Katrina experience \u00bb . To date, more than 6,000 volunteers have worked with the St. Bernard Project, enabling more than 120 families to move back into their homes. McCartney says every house her group rebuilds has an impact on the community as a whole. \"Once you get one family back, other families are willing to come back as well,\" she says. \"There's a very nice ripple effect.\" McCartney and Rosenburg plan to keep working until all the homes in St. Bernard Parish are rebuilt. \"We're here until we work ourselves out of a job,\" she says.  Watch McCartney describe her turning point while volunteering in New Orleans \u00bb . For Aguilar, McCartney isn't just rebuilding homes -- she's restoring a sense of hope to the community. \"Little by little, one house at a time, we'll be back,\" he says. \"I feel it. I know it.\"", "f180005b2c6a275f9922c1ffce96149ccfa4f06d": "(Mental Floss) -- Behind every good war are many good women. Using their feminine (and in at least one case masculine) wiles, the following five spies would make James Bond proud. Noor Inayat Khan was posthumously awarded the George Cross for her spy service. 1. Mata Hari . While Margaretha Geertruida Zelle MacLeod (1876--1917) may not have caused World War I, she sure as heck kept it going. Having spent time in Java with her husband, Captain Campbell MacLeod, Margaretha returned to Holland and sued for divorce. To make ends meet she took up exotic dancing and the name Mata Hari (meaning \"the light of day\" in Malay). With her sensual performances becoming the attraction of the major European cities came the men and the gifts for her favors. Many of these favors came from royalty and high-ranking French and German military officers. As World War I progressed, both sides became suspicious that Mata was spying for the other side. The French eventually put her on trial and, although the charges were never proven, Mata Hari was convicted of espionage and was executed by a firing squad on October 15, 1917. Playing the seductress up until the end, Mata refused a blindfold, smiled, and blew a kiss to the firing squad as the fatal shots were fired. Mental Floss: When a criminal survives execution . 2. Noor Inayat Khan . Khan was born in 1914 and at a young age moved with her family first to England and then to France. In 1940, Khan, along with her mother and sister, escaped back to England just before France surrendered to Germany. While in England she joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), but her ability to speak fluent French soon caught the attention of the Special Operations group and Khan agreed to become a spy. Khan was flown to Le Mans, where she teamed up with other female spies and traveled to Paris, France. There they joined the French Resistance Prosper Network. Soon after their arrival, the network was infiltrated and many were arrested. Khan was ordered to return to England, but instead she stayed on and continued to pass information on to England. Eventually she was arrested again and interrogated by the Gestapo. When she refused to speak, she was sent to a prison in Germany and then to the Dachau concentration camp. On September 13, 1944, Khan and three other female British spies were executed by the Nazi SS. In 1949, Khan was posthumously awarded the George Cross. 3. Belle Boyd (aka \"La Belle Rebelle\") Born Isabelle Boyd in Martinsburg, Virginia, in 1844, the beautiful Belle soon became the star attraction in Washington, D.C., social circles prior to the beginning of the Civil War. With the outbreak of the war, she returned to Martinsburg. When the Union soldiers occupied the city, Belle mixed with the officers and soon gathered information on troop movements, which she passed on to the Confederate forces. However, she is probably best known for warning Stonewall Jackson that the Union intended to blow up all the bridges around Martinsburg. With this information, Jackson, with a small number of troops, was able to surprise the Union troops and drive them from the area. In 1864, Confederate president Jefferson Davis asked Belle to carry letters for him to England. The Union Navy captured her ship, but the officer in charge fell in love with Belle and let her escape. The officer, Lieutenant Samuel Harding Jr., after being courtmartialed and discharged from the Navy, traveled to England, where he married Belle. After the war, Boyd toured the United States as an actress under the stage name of La Belle Rebelle. 4. Elizabeth Van Lew . Crazy Bet, as she was known, was born in Richmond, Virginia, in 1818 but educated at a Quaker school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After developing a hatred for slavery, Elizabeth returned to Richmond and freed all her family's slaves. She also went so far as finding where her freed slaves' relatives were and purchased and freed them also. After the Civil War started, Elizabeth asked to visit Union prisoners being held captive in Richmond. The Union prisoners gave her information, which she then passed on to the North. Among the slaves she freed was Mary Elizabeth Bowser, whom Van Lew got a job as a house servant in the home of Jefferson Davis. This allowed Bowser and Van Lew to collect and pass on information directly from the Confederate president's mansion. Elizabeth effectively used the Crazy Bet moniker to make the residents of Richmond think she was mentally ill. She would wear old clothes and bonnets and talk to herself. Because of this, most people thought that her Northern sympathies were just a part of her craziness. Mental Floss: Confederacy's plan to conquer Latin America . After the war, President Grant named Elizabeth the postmaster for Richmond. When the citizens of Richmond found out that Crazy Bet was an act, they shunned her. However, at her death, the state of Massachusetts placed a memorial marker on her grave. 5. Sarah Emma Edmonds (or Was It Frank Thompson?) Born in 1841 in New Brunswick, Canada, Sarah ran away from home in her early teens. In order to survive she became an itinerant Bible salesman, by calling herself Frank Thompson and dressing like a man. In 1861, Frank (Sarah) enlisted in the Second Michigan Infantry and over the next two years not only fought in a number of Civil War battles, but also served as a spy for the Union Army. Solders in her unit called Frank \"our woman\" because of his feminine mannerisms and his extremely small boot size. However, none of her comrades ever figured out that Frank was really Sarah.  Mental Floss: Celebrity or look-alike? This boded well for her spying, where she dressed as a young boy serving in Confederate camps, as an immigrant Irish peddler and, most interestingly, as a woman. In 1863, Sarah caught malaria and deserted the army out of fear that hospitalization would reveal her true identity. In 1884, though, Sarah applied for and was awarded a veteran's pension in which the secretary of war acknowledged that Sarah was a female soldier who had rendered faithful services to the ranks.

Glamour, femininity and sensuality: The three watchwords of Donatella Versace's fashion empire. It may not be frivolous, but in many respects it is a form of fantasy, something that Versace has developed as head of the Italian fashion house since taking over the reigns after the tragic death of her brother Gianni. \"We sell a lifestyle, so to own one piece of Versace is like to own a whole outfit of expensive things. That's why we do many different things,\" she told CNN. With a range of lifestyle items from sunglasses to furniture and even hotels, the Versace brand developed since the 1980's when it was all about supermodels and a confident, almost decadent, glamour. Not that the rich and beautiful have disappeared from the world of Versace. Fans and faces of Versace read as catalogue of glossy party A-listers included Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Halle Berry, Kate Moss and Demi Moore. Gianni Versace was one of the first fashion designers to recognize the power of celebrity, and Donatella, working with her brother, had a strong hand in the advertising campaigns. With iconic photographer Richard Avedon taking the shots, his images and Donatella's direction helped create the bold image of Versace in the 1980s and early 1990's making it synonymous with toned and beautiful Hollywood stars. It was Gianni who designed \"that dress\" that launched Elizabeth Hurley's career and Donatella's own safety pin moment came when Jennifer Lopez had the paparazzi and fashionistas goggling when she wore a plunging green Versace at the Grammys in 2000. While she has taken the Versace company in her own direction, Gianni was a huge influence on her life, encouraging her to join him when he was setting up his burgeoning fashion business. \"Gianni was a very strong personality. We were two people who loved each other dearly. We were brother and sister. Very tight family. When Gianni became a big fashion star I was the only one who told him the truth,\" she said. After he was shot dead outside his Miami home in 1997, Donatella had to cope with running the fashion empire and deal with her own grief. \"I didn't know if I would follow exactly Gianni's steps or find my own way and I was suffering from my brother's death. But in the meantime I had to be strong because everybody around me was looking at me for direction. But then I found my way and I started to believe in myself more and more, find my confidence and here I am,\" she told CNN. The Versace image may be more toned down compared to 20 years ago, but for Donatella the three guiding words of Versace remain: \"glamour, femininity and sensuality.\" \"I think fashion is to make people dream. Nobody thinks they are going to look exactly like the model on the runway, nobody wants people to think that, but it is here to make people to want to have something. I try the best I can to try and make people to want and desire things,\" she said. China is one part of the world that Donatella is increasingly selling the dream, with the first Versace show in Beijing in early November signifying a new chapter in the Versace brand expansion. \"Chinese people view fashion in a different way from other people. They buy the whole style, the whole look together. In other countries they like the accessory or they like the clothes but they like one thing of the look. [In China] it's good because you can convey they message together,\" she told CNN. Donatella's fashion tips: . CNN: What should a woman always have in her wardrobe? Versace: A pair of black high heels. CNN: What should a man always have in his wardrobe? Versace: A pair of low-waist pants. It makes your upper body taller and your shoulders larger. CNN: What is the most commonly made fashion mistake? Versace: Too much make-up and clothes together. It's about one of those, not all. CNN: What is the ugliest trend you've ever seen?

The crowd formed just hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve Board authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend $85 billion to a crumbling AIG. In return, the federal government will receive a nearly 80 percent stake in the company. One person who lined up in Singapore, retired teacher Wong Yoke Inn, said she was going to pull her investments from AIA even though it would cost her about $3,000 -- the equivalent of about $2,000 in the United States.

A commando in disguise give details of what went down in the Taj hotel when commandos went in. Terrorists were still holding 200 people 33 hours after the assault began. Knowing next to nothing about what they might encounter in the dark recesses of the hotel, Indian Army commandos decided to go back in -- and were met by terrorists firing mercilessly, throwing  grenades and continuously switching positions. The sound of gunfire and explosions reverberated throughout the hotel's atrium, making it impossible to pinpoint the origin of the shots. Through it all, the commandos walked down pitch-black halls, trying to navigate the damaged hotel without knowing the layout. A commando spokesman, his face and hair swathed in a black scarf and wearing dark glasses to hide his identity, revealed these details of the mission inside the Taj at a news conference Friday. At 6:30 a.m. Friday, the battle at the Taj came to a head with a final firefight at the room holding the 200 hostages, he said.  Watch what it was like inside the hotel for commandos \u00bb . When the gunfire stopped, commandos -- known as the Black Cats -- entered the room and freed all 200 hostages. Their difficulties had been apparent from the beginning, he said. \"We did not know the layout of the hotel,\" the commando told reporters. \"There was one person on the hotel staff who was helping to guide us around.\" They entered the hotel for the first time essentially blind to what was ahead.

See the first photos from inside the Taj Mahal hotel \u00bb . \"At that time, they vanished ... they had gone elsewhere,\" the commando said. The attackers had a clear advantage, commandos said, because it was apparent from their movements they knew the hotel's layout. Some tourists rescued from the hotel said the building's large dome and a massive atrium made the sounds of gunfire and explosions reverberate endlessly. It was impossible to pinpoint where the shooters were. Because of the darkness, commandos could not tell how many terrorists were there -- were there many, or only a few who continued to change positions? At one point, commandos believed some of the terrorists were hiding on the eighth floor. As the commandos approached one of the rooms, attackers opened fire at them and said all the people in the room were dead. \"We fired at them and they fired at us, but because the room was absolutely dark and we had just gotten [inside] it made it difficult for us,\" the commando said.  Watch commandos talk about fighting the attackers \u00bb . During the fight, two commandos were shot. They decided to flush out the terrorists by blocking entry and exit routes. But the attackers knew all the doors, he said. When they made it inside the room, the terrorists had disappeared again. Inside that room, commandos found AK-47 ammunition rounds, including seven magazines fully loaded, and 400 other rounds for other weapons. They found grenades, credit cards, U.S. notes, foreign money and bags of dried fruit, which they believed helped sustain the attackers during the siege. During the three-day assault, the attackers fired indiscriminately. But the commandos were forced to use caution. \"Let me tell you one thing,\" the commando said. \"Within the first exchanges of fire, we could have got those terrorists -- but there was so many hotel guests -- there were bodies all over and blood all over. And we were trying to avoid the causalities of civilians. We had to be more careful in our fighting.\" In trying to rescue hostages and trapped civilians, commandos had to convince guests they were there to help, not terrorists trying to trick them, Indian Army Lt. Gen. Noble Thamburaj said. \"There are a number of rooms that are locked from inside,\" he told reporters.  \"It is possible that some of the hotel guests have locked themselves in and for their own security and safety. Even though we have identified ourselves they are not opening the doors.\" The overall operation may have been made more difficult because of a late start, CNN sister station CNN-IBN reported.

The ministry said it summoned Ambassador Anne Patterson to underscore that such attacks violate Pakistan's sovereignty and should be stopped immediately.

Taken from a small airplane, the photos show men outside thatched communal huts, necks craned upward, pointing bows toward the air in a remote corner of the Amazonian rainforest. The National Indian Foundation, a government agency in Brazil, published the photos Thursday on its Web site. It tracks \"uncontacted tribes\" -- indigenous groups that are thought to have had no contact with outsiders -- and seeks to protect them from encroachment. More than 100 uncontacted tribes remain worldwide, and about half live in the remote reaches of the Amazonian rainforest in Peru or Brazil, near the recently photographed tribe, according to Survival International, a nonprofit group that advocates for the rights of indigenous people. \"All are in grave danger of being forced off their land, killed or decimated by new diseases,\" the organization said Thursday. Illegal logging in Peru is threatening several uncontacted groups, pushing them over the border with Brazil and toward potential conflicts with about 500 uncontacted Indians living on the Brazilian side, Survival International said. Its director, Stephen Cory, said the new photographs highlight the need to protect uncontacted people from intrusion by the outside world. \"These pictures are further evidence that uncontacted tribes really do exist,\" Cory said in a statement. \"The world needs to wake up to this, and ensure that their territory is protected in accordance with international law. Otherwise, they will soon be made extinct.\" The photos released Thursday show men who look strong and healthy, the Brazilian government said. They and their relatives apparently live in six communal shelters known as malocas, according to the government, which has tracked at least four uncontacted groups in the region for the past 20 years.

Atlantis was prepared to launch in September before an onboard computer failed, delaying the mission. Hubble managers say ground testing of a critical replacement computer that they hope to install on the orbiting telescope is taking longer than previously expected. And that means an additional flight delay. \"Delivery in April to support a May launch, I think is a fair thing to say,\" said Hubble program manager Preston Burch. \"Right now I think we have a very good chance of meeting a readiness date in that time frame.\" The additional delay is just the latest dip in an emotional rollercoaster ride for the Hubble team over the past few months. In late September, astronauts were mere weeks away from launching to Hubble aboard the space shuttle Atlantis, with spacewalks planned to make the telescope more powerful than ever and extend its expected lifespan an additional five years. That flight had to be postponed when the onboard computer that downlinks scientific data to the ground suddenly failed on September 27th. While that problem has been corrected using a back-up system, NASA managers have decided the computer needs to be completely replaced in order to keep a fully redundant back-up capability available. A spare computer was built prior to Hubble's launch in 1990, and has been warehoused at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland ever since. Initially, engineers had hoped that spare could be quickly tested, certified \"flight ready,\" and shipped to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to be packed aboard Atlantis in time for a February launch. But a closer evaluation of the spare shows more than six months of work will be needed to get it ready to fly. Among other issues, it was partially disassembled other the years so that parts could be used for other systems. It has been largely put back together, but now programming anomalies are cropping up. And once engineers get it in good working order, it will have to go a battery of environmental tests to make sure it is ready to hold up in the harsh conditions of space. But the engineers are confident that they will eventually overcome all the obstacles. \"We've gotten a lot smarter about the condition of this unit over the last four weeks, said Burch. \"We don't want to take any chances in bringing a box up there that isn't going to be 100% working to the absolute best that it can. So we want to take some extra time and make sure that we subject this to a very rigorous test program and we don't want to leave any stones unturned on the way to the launch pad.\"", "d661bbaed3356f1c85bcba5155d63eb0f025bba2": "MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A car bomb exploded Thursday in a parking lot at the University of Navarra in Pamplona, Spain, sparking a massive fire, but \"luckily,\" no one was nearby and there were no deaths, Spain's interior minister said. \"There could have been an enormous tragedy today at the University of Navarra,\" Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said hours after the attack in a televised address. Hospital officials told CNN that 27 people suffered minor injuries, including one American woman and five other non-Spaniards. The Basque separatist group ETA is suspected to be behind the attack. The car, packed with an unknown quantity of explosives, was parked in a lot near the university's library and detonated shortly after 11 a.m. local time (6 a.m. ET), Rubalcaba said.  Watch witness describe the blast \u00bb . Campus authorities shut down the entire campus shortly after the blast to search for a possible second explosive device near the science building, about a half kilometer (.3 mile) from the car bombing, according to CNN's partner station in Spain, CNN+.

No device was found and the search was called off Thursday afternoon, according to a university spokesman and a representative for the national government's main office in Navarra. Most of the campus was reopened; only the area surrounding the bomb blast remained cordoned off, they said. Classes are expected to resume as scheduled on Friday, the university spokesman said. The car bomb sparked a massive fire in the campus' Central Building, where about 400 students and staff were located at the time, university spokesman Jesus Diaz told CNN+. Video from the scene showed fire engulfing part of the building and thick clouds of black smoke billowing over the campus. Authorities in Spain's Basque province of Alava received a warning call at 9:50 a.m. in the name of ETA.  Watch aftermath of the blast \u00bb . The warning call to the DYA emergency services in Alava said the car bomb would strike a university campus in the city of Vitoria about an hour after the phone call, prompting emergency officials to search that campus and determine that the call was merely a false alarm, Rubalcaba said. \"So whoever planted the bomb either gave an intentionally misleading warning call or they made a mistake,\" he said in his televised address. According to CNN+, the University of Navarra has been targeted by ETA six times in the past 30 years, and one faculty member said it is unclear why. \"It is not a political university,\" Professor Maria Teresa La Porte told CNN. \"We don't understand.\" \"If they are looking for innocent victims, the place to find them is here,\" she said. \"There is no way to stop them.\" She said it is an open campus with students from various backgrounds -- including Basque -- where people \"can come here completely freely.\" The blast could be heard across the campus of the private school, which has 12,000 students -- including more than 1,000 scholars from countries outside Spain. It is also home to Spain's top-rated journalism school, which is located not too far from the blast site. A spokeswoman for Clinica Universitaria de Navarra -- located across the street from the university -- said that 24 patients were treated for injuries ranging from glass cuts to hearing problems. Most have been released and only two are expected to remain overnight, she said. Two other patients are being treated at Hospital Virgen del Camino, also in Pamplona, but their nationalities were not clear. Those being treated at Clinica Universitaria de Navarra included 18 Spaniards and six others with the following nationalities: American woman from California, age 20; Italian woman, age 28; Portuguese woman, age 23; Chilean woman, age 25; Peruvian man, age 28 and Philippines man, age 34. Thursday's explosion came just days after Spanish police arrested four suspected ETA members early Tuesday. Authorities accused them of forming a terrorist cell that was ready to attack, the Spanish Interior Ministry said in a statement. Three of the suspects were arrested in or near the city of Pamplona, in Spain's northern Navarra region, which has Basque roots and was to be the base for the alleged cell, the statement said. The fourth suspect was arrested in the city of Valencia, on Spain's eastern coast. Police seized two revolvers and ammunition; various timers that might be used for bombs; detonating cord; items that might be used to make a bomb attached to the underside of vehicles; various substances that might be used to make explosives; and computer documentation, the ministry said. All four suspects -- three men and a woman -- were born in Pamplona and range in age from 26 to 29, the ministry said. ETA is blamed for more than 800 killings in its four-decade-long fight for Basque independence. The European Union and the United States list ETA as a terrorist group.

Widespread reports claimed that gold medal winner  He Kexin was only 14 years of age. An investigation was launched after the Beijing Games over claims that several members of their women's squad were  ineligible because they were not 16 in the year of competition. But on Wednesday, the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) closed a near six-week probe saying that documentation provided confirms they were old enough to compete. The inquiry had been called for by the International Olympic Committee who were concerned that the controversy undermined the results of the competition in Beijing.  Watch tiny gymnasts work out \u00bb . China provided passports, ID cards and family registers for He Kexin, Yang Yilin, Jiang Yuyuan, Deng Linlin and Li Shanshan, all showing the girls were 16 or would turn 16 this year. \"We have received all we could possibly ask for,\" FIG secretary general Andre Gueisbuhler told Associated Press. \"All of them confirm the age that they should be, so what can we do ?\" he added. The Chinese women's gymnastics team won a gold medal in a team competition in Beijing and five members won individual medals. One of the challenges came from a blogger known as \"Stryde Hax.\" The blogger claimed to have uncovered proof that He Kexin is only 14. In Internet searches, \"Stryde Hax\" allegedly uncovered Web pages showing lists complied by China's General Administration of Sport that show a 1994 date of birth for He. That would make her 14 -- too young to compete in the Olympic Games. CNN was not been able to independently verify the information, but snapshots of the Web pages appeared to back up the claim. Other bloggers joined the search and reported similar results. The New York Times conducted its own investigation, producing similar results that seem to implicate He and two other members of the team. The Times uncovered a 2006 biography on He that lists her birthday as January 1, 1994. But Chinese gymnastics coaches have stridently defended their team. \"Asians have different figures than people from the West, so that's what caused their suspicion,\" said Huang Yubin, head coach of the men's and women's teams, referring to media inquiries. \"They shouldn't be suspicious.\" It was not all good news for the Chinese gymnasts, with the FIG announcing that it would step up its investigation into the 2000 team which won the bronze medal at the Sydney Olympics, particularly Dong Fangxiao and Yang Yun. Yang, who also won a bronze medal on the uneven bars in 2000, said in a June 2007 interview that aired on state broadcaster China Central Television that she was only 14 in Sydney . Dong, who was a technical official for the Chinese team in Beijing, allegedly provided documents for her credentials which indicated that she too must have been only 14 in 2000. Gueisbuhler warned that legal and statute of limitation issues might hinder further scrutiny and sanctions against the 2000 Chinese team. Underage gymnasts have been a problem since the 1980s, when the minimum age was raised from 14 to 15 to protect young athletes from serious injuries. The minimum age was raised to its current 16 in 1997. North Korea was barred from the 1993 world championships after FIG officials discovered Kim Gwang Suk, the 1991 gold medalist on uneven bars, was listed as 15 for three years in a row. Romania admitted in 2002 that several gymnasts' ages had been falsified, including Olympic medalists Gina Gogean and Alexandra Marinescu. In women's gymnastics, younger teenage girls can have an advantage over older competitors due to their often smaller, more agile bodies and lighter frames. Copyright 2008 CNN.

Sarah Palin will face off for their first and only debate in the presidential race Thursday night, an event pitting a political veteran against a political newcomer. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has been preparing since last week for Thursday's debate. Both candidates have recently tried to lower expectations leading into the debate, where topics will range from domestic to foreign policy. The debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, will start at 9 p.m. ET and be moderated by PBS's Gwen Ifill. For Palin, the stakes are high. After skyrocketing onto the national stage and energizing the Republican faithful, the first-term Alaskan governor has struggled recently to regain her footing after several shaky network TV interviews with ABC's Charlie Gibson and CBS's Katie Couric.  View memorable moments from other debates \u00bb . Palin said Tuesday that she's different. \"I think they're just not used to someone coming in from the outside saying, 'You know what? It's time that normal Joe Six-Pack American is finally represented in the position of vice presidency,' and I think that that's kind of taken some people off-guard,\" she said in a radio interview with conservative host Hugh Hewitt. Palin's interview gave the vice presidential candidate a chance to showcase elements of her life story and demonstrate some of the folksiness that's been central to her political success. It's exactly the kind of interview that voters can expect to see from the governor in the coming weeks, according to a Palin adviser, who recognized that there is hunger in Republican circles and among the public at large to see a less-scripted, more authentic candidate. \"We're going to be continue to put her in settings where she has an opportunity to shine, to be on offense,\" the adviser said. \"We've gotten very good feedback from the public from Hugh Hewitt interview.\" The adviser suggested that the campaign's efforts at damage control after Palin's interview with Couric may have been hampered by the fact that the governor wasn't doing more friendly interviews to counter her flubs on Russia and the congressional bailout bill, which have reverberated throughout the blogosphere and even turned Palin into a punch line on \"Saturday Night Live.\" \"We acknowledge that perhaps she should have been out there doing more,\" the adviser said, arguing that \"it's not fair to judge her off one or two sound bites\" from the network interviews. Palin is apparently eager to take on a more outspoken role, both in interviews and in her stump speech, after Thursday's vice presidential debate in order to remind voters of what it is they like about her. iReport.com: Watch debate, then tell us who won . \"She connects really well, and she's good at it, and she wants to be doing more of it, and she will do more of it,\" the adviser said. For the Democrats, Biden has served in the Senate for 35 years. His biggest challenge will be to stick to the script. He's known for making off-the-cuff remarks, including some gaffes.  Watch analysts weigh in on Thursday's debate \u00bb . A Biden aide said the senator is ready. He left Wednesday's debate preparation in Delaware to vote on the economic recovery bill in Congress. \"I haven't read the package yet, but my anticipation is I'm going to vote 'yes.' But I want to see. That's why I'm going home now to get briefed on the details,\" Biden said. Biden campaign aides are actively playing up Palin's debating skills. His spokesman called Palin \"a leviathan of forensics,\" a classic example of the campaign tactic of raising the expectations of their opponent and lowering their own. \"She's very skilled, and she'll be well-prepared,\" Barack Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, said Sunday night while flying with Biden back to Delaware to help him get ready. \"As you saw at the convention, she can be very good. So, I think it would be foolish to assume that this isn't going to be a really challenging debate. We're preparing for that, on that assumption.\" Taking it one step further, Biden spokesman David Wade added, \"he's going in here to debate a leviathan of forensics who has debated five times, and she's undefeated.\" Biden has a difficult task on his hand: not coming across as condescending with his decades of experience and not adopting a tone that could appear as though he's treating Palin differently because she's a woman. \"I think Gov. Palin is a skilled politician,\" Axelrod said. \"She got elected in a very tough political arena against tough opponents, and we're going to treat her with the respect that she deserves. And I think that she would expect that; I think voters should expect that.\" Axelrod argued that at the end of the day, the choice voters make is between the candidates at the top of the ticket and not the vice presidential candidates. However, he said vice presidential nominees have a harder time preparing because they need to not only defend their own positions but those of their running mates, as well as knowing where both candidates on the opposing ticket stand. Obama and John McCain, meanwhile, have two more debates before the November 4 general election: a second debate October 7 at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, and a final debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, on October 15.

During the news conference, Obama called Clinton a woman of \"extraordinary intelligence and toughness\" who will \"command respect in every capital.\" \"Hillary's appointment is a sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment to renew American diplomacy and restore our alliances,\" Obama said. Speculation that Obama would appoint his former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination to the nation's top diplomatic post surfaced after the two meet secretly in Chicago in mid-November. When Clinton's name was first mentioned for secretary of state, the Obama team reviewed the relationships her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had forged as part of his charitable foundation work. The Obama team was concerned that the relationships could create conflicts of interest. To address those concerns, the former president agreed to disclose the names of the more than 200,000 donors to his presidential foundation, a move he had previously resisted, Obama aides told CNN on Sunday. He also agreed to separate his work with the Clinton Global Initiative from his foundation work and submit the text of future speeches and other activities to State Department officials for review, the Obama aides said. In a statement, President Clinton said he was \"deeply proud\" that Obama has chosen his wife to be secretary of state. \"She is the right person for the job of helping to restore America's image abroad, end the war in Iraq, advance peace and increase our security, by building a future for our children with more partners and fewer adversaries, one of shared responsibilities and opportunities,\" he said.

Later, Obama questioned Clinton's argument that she had more foreign policy experience. But during the news conference, Obama dismissed any lingering resentment between himself and Clinton as a result of the tough campaign. Clinton and the other members of the national security team \"would not have agreed to join my administration -- and I would not have asked them to be part of this administration -- unless we shared a core vision of what's needed to keep the American people safe and to assure prosperity here at home and peace abroad,\" he said. Obama said there was not a \"light bulb moment\" when he decided to ask Clinton to be his secretary of state but would not reveal details on the talks that led up to him asking his former rival to join his team.  Watch Obama praise Clinton's abilities \u00bb . \"I have always admired Sen. Clinton. We have worked together extensively in the Senate,\" Obama said. \"After the election was over and I began to think about my team, it occurred to me that she could potentially be an outstanding secretary of state,\" he said. \"I extended her the offer, and she accepted. I know that's not as juicy a story as you were hoping for, but that's all you are going to get.\" Clinton will also be working with Defense Secretary Robert Gates, whom Obama asked to stay on when he takes office.  Watch Gates on why he is staying \u00bb . Gates was responsible for implementing an increase in troop strength in Iraq that both Obama and Clinton criticized while on the campaign trail. He will now, however, work to implement the drawdown of troops in Iraq that the president-elect promised during the campaign. After announcing Clinton and the rest of his national security team, Obama said he was sure that team members shared \"a core vision of what's needed to keep the American people safe,\" but he also wanted \"strong personalities and strong opinions\" in his administration. \"I think that's how the best decisions are made,\" Obama said. \"One of the dangers in the White House, based on my reading of history, is that you get wrapped up in groupthink, and everybody agrees with everything, and there is no discussion and there are no dissenting views.\" CNN's Scott J.

Witchcraft has not been punishable by death for nearly 300 years. They said Halloween is a good time to highlight the \"grave miscarriage of justice\" suffered by the men and women falsely accused of being witches. Their petition asks Justice Minister Jack Straw to recommend that Queen Elizabeth II issue a pardon. \"We felt that it was time that the sinister associations held by a minority of people regarding witches and Halloween were tackled head-on,\" said Emma Angel, head of Angels, a large costume supplier in London. \"We were gobsmacked to discover that though the law was changed hundreds of years ago and society had moved on, the victims were never officially pardoned.\" Angels launched a Web site, pardonthewitches.com, to solicit signatures for their petition. They had between 150 and 200 by Friday morning, Angels spokesman Benjamin Webb said, but they hoped Halloween publicity would generate more. Around 400 people were executed in England and some 4,000 in Scotland for alleged witchcraft, campaigners say. The Witchcraft Act of 1735 put an end to trials of accused witches, but many still faced persecution and jail for other crimes such as fraud. \"It shifted from a spiritual thing to more of a criminal thing,\" Webb said, but \"it didn't pardon those people who'd suffered before.\" The campaigners worked with witchcraft historian John Callow to detail eight cases they hope will persuade the government to act. They include the case of Ursula Kemp, a woman who offered cures in Essex, England in the 1500s. The uneven results of her work prompted accusations of witchcraft and she was hanged in 1582. A century later, Mary Trembles and Susanna Edwards were begging for food in Exeter, England, when a local woman blamed one of them for an illness and they were jailed. A jail visitor noticed Edwards' shaky hands and suggested she was \"tormenting someone.\" It started a string of rumors that resulted in an accusation of witchcraft, and the women were executed in 1682. In 1645, clergyman John Lowes was regarded as too attached to Catholicism in a strongly Reformed area. He had already defended himself once against witchcraft when he came to the attention of a notorious zealot named Matthew Hopkins. Hopkins made Lowes walk for days and nights until he was unable to resistconfessing to being a witch. Lowes was hanged in Bury St. Edmunds, England, after conducting his own funeral. \"Today we are well aware that these individuals were neither capable of harmful magic nor in league with the devil,\" Callow said. He said the endemic poverty of the 16th to 18th centuries put pressure on leaders and the judiciary to blame someone for society's problems -- so they decided to blame witches. \"A lot of these cases were score-settling in local communities,\" Webb said, adding many cases of alleged witchcraft weren't even reported. \"The notion that people could suspend their disbelief and believe that women were talking to toads -- just horrible times. Horrible times.\" In 2004, one Scottish town managed to get a pardon for the 81 accused witches that had been put to death there. The independent baron court in Prestonpans, near Edinburgh, pardoned them before the court was officially disbanded in November of that year. In its ruling, the court pardoned both the accused witches and their cats who, it said, were executed for \"conjuration or sorcery.\" It said their convictions were based on insufficient evidence that often relied on \"voices\" or the actions of \"spirits\" to attest to their guilt. A separate group petitioned the Scottish parliament last month, asking for pardons for each of the 4,000 witches who were put to death across the nation. Ewan Irvine, a medium with Full Moon Investigations, acknowledged it's unlikely they will get a pardon for every accused witch, so the group is going ahead with a private memorial in Scotland instead. \"It would be an apology to all those accused,\" said Irvine, whose group investigates the paranormal. Webb said while few people today may believe those men and women deserved execution, their stories still generate suspicion and stigma. That extends to modern-day criticism of children dressing as witches at Halloween with the idea that it's evil or connected to the devil, he said. \"Witches were not emissaries of Satan,\" Webb said. \"They were in fact persecuted women and men who deserve a pardon.\" A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice would not comment on the case but said the granting of such a pardon is extremely rare. \"To receive a royal pardon, the test is a high one,\" the spokesman said. \"Evidence must prove conclusively that no offense was committed or that the applicant did not commit the offense. It is not enough that the conviction may be unsafe -- the applicant must be technically and morally innocent.\" Accused witches were also tried and put to death in the famous Salem witch trials in the U.S. state of Massachusetts in the late 1600s, but all were later pardoned, said Alison D'Amario, director of education at the Salem Witch Museum. The names of 14 were cleared in 1711 after their families applied to the government, D'Amario said. Gov. Foster Furcolo cleared one name in 1957, and then-Gov. Jane Swift cleared the remaining five in 2001, she said. \"Their names are now on a list that makes it seem as though they were innocent, which they surely were,\" D'Amario said.", "6a7c84f9727de4f595b7ea476f273ba6eea7a4d1": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A juvenile court in Ghana has sentenced two teenage girls from Great Britain to nine months in jail for trying to smuggle cocaine out of the country, Ghana's national news agency said Wednesday.

The girls faced a maximum sentence of three years but are expected to be released on April 18, the group said. For now, the girls are housed in a correctional home for girls in the country's capital, Accra. Ghanaian police arrested the teenagers as they were readying to board a British Airways flight back to London last July. When officials searched their laptop bags as part of departure formalities, they found about 6 kg (13 lbs) of cocaine, the Ghana News Agency and British media reports said. Authorities in Ghana said a man paid the girls 6,000 pounds (about $11,700) to fly to Ghana to retrieve the laptop bags containing the drugs from two of his associates, the news agency added. Those men have not been caught. Fair Trials called the girls \"pawns in a larger operation. \"It is deeply unfortunate that they, and not the men who lured them to Ghana, are bearing the consequences,\" said the group's chief executive, Catherine Wolthuizen. Ghana and other West African countries have become a transit point for drugs headed to Europe. The girls were arrested in a joint Britain-Ghana drug detection operation, the United Kingdom's customs agency said Wednesday.

The Army Recruiting Command is examining recruiters all over the country for job-related and combat-related stress. The board will look at how to handle the high-stress climate facing recruiters who may be both under pressure from their job and victims of post-combat deployment stress, according to Douglas Smith, a spokesman from the U.S. Army Recruiting command. \"The United States Army Recruiting Command is deeply concerned by the instances of suicide within the Houston Recruiting Battalion,\" said a statement released by the Recruiting Command. \"The board's objective will be to prevent future suicides, increase suicide awareness, analyze trends and highlight additional tools and resources to combat suicide within the Recruiting Command.\" The Army's examination comes after a sergeant first class, a member of the Houston Recruiting Battalion and an Iraq combat veteran, killed himself at his home earlier this month. CNN has chosen not to name any of the recruiters. The sergeant's was the second suicide within the ranks of the battalion within weeks, Army officials said. In August, a staff sergeant, a combat veteran in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, also killed himself. Another Houston recruiter killed himself in 2007 and a yet another in 2005, Army records show. The Army Recruiting Command is sending a team -- including a chaplain and a psychologist -- to assist the Houston recruiters. The team was scheduled to show up in mid-September, but because of the severe hurricane damage the arrival was delayed until October, officials said. A chaplain from Army Recruiting Command in Fort Knox, Kentucky, was sent to be with the battalion shortly after the latest victim's death, Smith said. He said recruiters receive annual suicide prevention training, and commanders have additional tools to help their soldiers cope. The members of the Houston battalion received their last training in December 2007, according to an Army statement. The Army Recruiting Command is examining recruiters all over the country for both job-related and combat-related stress problems, but is giving special attention to the Houston battalion at the moment, according to Smith. \"We do not have any other circumstances with our recruiters around the country like we do with the Houston unit,\" he said. The deaths of the two recruiters this year also caught the eye of U.S. Sen. John Cornyn from Texas. Cornyn wrote a letter to Army Secretary Pete Geren this month about the suicide rate in the battalion. \"Due to the recurring deployments that have proven necessary to sustain operations in the Middle East, it is likely that a large majority of our recruiters are also veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" he wrote. \"Many of our military recruiters work in recruiting offices and facilities remote from the military installations at which their fellow soldiers serve. As such, many of them lack the same access to peer support networks and important services for dealing with stress, anxiety, PTSD and other conditions that may directly result from their prior combat service,\" he said. A veteran's advocacy group says Houston has one of the top recruiting operations in the United States but there is a good deal of stress in bringing in new recruits when the Army is stretched. \"The suicides in the Houston battalion are a very loud, very bright alarm that Army officials and politicians can't afford to ignore,\" said Paul Sullivan, executive director of Veterans for Common Sense. While recruiting among all of the services has been on target for more than a year, the stress levels on recruiters to bring in new service members can be crushing with extended hours and, many times, six- or seven-day work weeks. Army officials said Cornyn was correct in saying one of the problems for recruiters is they work in locations often far from bases where they can get the mental health help that is readily available to other troops. With the United States at war for the past seven years, the vast majority of recruiters have combat experience, Smith said. The recruiter suicides come at a time when the total number of suicides in the Army's ranks has been growing, Army officials said. Through August there had been 93 active duty suicides in the Army. Last year there were 115 active duty suicides, the highest for the Army since the Vietnam War, according to Army statistics.", "da1d1b34f7c3cfa21550f7a8bc3d8504551abcd7": "MANCHESTER, England -- Owen Hargreaves curled in a superb free-kick, 18 minutes from time, to give Manchester United a 2-1 Premier League victory over Arsenal at Old Trafford. Hargreaves curls his match-winning free-kick over the Arsenal wall and past Lehmann. The win lifted United six points clear of Chelsea, who meet Wigan on Monday, and effectively ended Arsenal's fading title bid. The Gunners trail United by nine points with four matches left to play. Emmanuel Adebayor gave Arsenal a 48th minute lead but Cristiano Ronaldo  equalized from the penalty spot minutes later with his 38th goal of the season. The loss dooms Arsene Wenger's side to their third season without a trophy and ends a black week which also included a Champions League quarterfinal defeat to English rivals Liverpool. England midfielder Hargreaves, best known for his determined defending, Scored United's 100th goal in 50 games this campaign when his curled free-kick from the edge of the box over the wall left goalkeeper Jens Lehmann standing. Adebayor headed Arsenal in front three minutes into the second period when he met Robin van Persie's cross and profited from confusion between United keeper Edwin van der Sar and center-back Rio Ferdinand. There were no complaints from United about the goal but tv replays suggested Adebayor may have handled the ball rather than knocked it in with his head, even though he was just a few yards away from goal. Six minutes later Arsenal defender William Gallas clearly handled inside his own area and referee Howard Webb pointed to the spot. Ronaldo netted but Webb ordered the penalty to be re-taken because of encroachment by other players. Lehmann, only playing because of a wrist injury to first-choice keeper Manuel Almunia, was then booked for delaying the second kick. Ronaldo, making light of the pressure of the situation, stuck with his stuttering run-up and struck the ball low and hard past the German international's right-hand.

Mayor Larry Langford, right, appears at a news conference Monday in Birmingham, Alabama. Larry Langford, 62, is named in an indictment that alleges criminal activity while he was a county commissioner, said U.S. Attorney Alice Martin. As president of the Jefferson County Commission and head of its department of finance and general services from November 2002 until about November 2006, Langford put his personal affairs ahead of those of the county, Martin said. \"Our investigation has revealed, and the indictment alleges, that Langford sold his public office to his friends and political supporters,\" Martin said. Also named in the 101-count indictment are William Blount, 55, a Montgomery, Alabama, investment banker, and Albert LaPierre, 58, a Birmingham lobbyist, neither of whom returned calls from CNN. \"Langford steered lucrative business to William Blount and his company and he, in turn, earned in excess of $7.1 million and, with the help of lobbyist Albert LaPierre, they ensured that Larry Langford's crushing personal debts were paid off through payoffs of loans, store charge accounts, purchases of clothing and jewelry and other items of value that exceeded $230,000 over a period from 2002 to 2006,\" Martin said. The allegations go back to a 1996 consent decree entered into by the commission to bring Jefferson County into compliance with the Clean Water Act, which required authorizing billions of dollars in transactions. After making his first appearance in U.S. District Court on Monday, Langford appeared outside the courthouse with his lawyer, who said he had told his client not to talk to reporters. \"He's got a city to run and right now, or very shortly, he's headed back to City Hall,\" the lawyer said. An indictment on some counts was returned in June to ensure they were not rendered moot by a five-year statute of limitations, Martin said. The superseding indictment returned last Tuesday by a federal grand jury was unsealed Monday after Langford's arrest. The other two men named in the indictment agreed to turn themselves in, she said. Langford conspired with Blount and LaPierre \"to solicit and to accept bribes, to use influence and position to ensure that Blount and his company, Blount Parrish Inc., was involved in Jefferson County's bonds and swap transactions related to multibillion-dollar sewer debt,\" Martin said. Though the financing was set up by then-big financial institutions -- including J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Bank of America -- \"Langford used his position to make it a condition that those financial institutions include Blount Parrish in the financing deals and paid Blount Parrish a fee in order to get the county financing business,\" Martin said. She cited an October 2003 financial transaction that included Bank of America and Lehman Special Financing Corp. that required Lehman to pay an \"arrangement fee\" of $35,000 to Blount's company. In all, she said, Blount and his company received $7.1 million in fees related to Jefferson County's financial transactions. In turn, Blount paid lobbyist LaPierre approximately $219,000 for \"consulting fees,\" Martin said. She added, \"Through a web of financing agreements, Langford required many institutions to use Blount as a consultant so Blount would make fees and in turn pay off Langford. It was a classic pay-to-play scheme.\" Martin said Blount and Langford traveled together to New York, where Blount bought Langford clothing and jewelry from high-end stores that included Tourneau, Zegna, Ferragamo and Turnbull & Asser. In addition, Blount bought Rolex watches and other jewelry for Langford from a Birmingham store, Martin said. Federal authorities are seeking criminal forfeiture of about $7.6 million from each of the men. Langford is named in 60 counts of the superseding indictment; Blount in 43 counts; and LaPierre in 22 counts. In addition to the fines, each defendant would face a maximum of 10 years for each bribery and money-laundering count, 20 years for each fraud count, five years for the conspiracy count and three years for each tax count. In a written statement, the mayor's office said city business will continue as usual. \"We are glad the mayor will finally have his day in court,\" said Langford's chief of staff, Deborah Vance-Bowie. \"As members of his team, we stand behind him and look forward to the day when we can return the focus to the important issues before the city.\" A public information officer said the president of the current five-member Jefferson County Commission, Bettye Collins, would have no comment .", "4d9c1dedc5a0d176631f1fd2c1cc014b2ed02101": "(CNN) -- The United States warned the Indian government about a potential maritime attack against Mumbai at least a month before last week's massacre in the country's financial capital left nearly 180 dead, a U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN.

Customers rushing to get into a Valley Stream, New York, Wal-Mart damaged doors and trampled a worker. Jdimytai Damour, 34, was crushed as he and other employees attempted to unlock the doors of a Long Island, New York, store at 5 a.m. Friday, police said. \"This incident was avoidable,\" said Bruce Both, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1500, the state of New York's largest grocery worker's union. \"Where were the safety barriers?

Wal-Mart spokesman Dave Tovar said Saturday that the company had no response to the union's comments, referring CNN to a written statement the retailer released Friday.

Unusual campaigns to promote condom use are being launched in places where condoms are less popular. But in many parts of the world, condoms aren't very popular. Here are five novel campaigns launched by nonprofit organizations and condom companies to encourage wider use. 1. A ring tone to remember . In India, people stigmatize condoms and refuse to wear them because they believe only prostitutes must use prophylactics. Leave it to one of the world's richest men to find a solution -- the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation donated money for a national condom ring tone. An a cappella group sings \"Condom, Condom\" -- in the style of doo-wop like the contagious pop song \"Barbara Ann\" -- when one receives a phone call. Despite its bubblegum sound, officials hope that the people who have the condom ring tone appear smart and responsible. Since the ring tone's August launch, more than 60,000 people downloaded it. Yvonne MacPherson, country director of the BBC World Service Trust (which the Gates foundation funded), sums it up best when she said to The Associated Press: \"A ring tone is a very public thing. It's a way to show you are a condom user and you don't have any issues with it.\" Right, nothing attracts the amorous attention like announcing loudly that you have a condom. 2. Perks you right up . Ethiopians claim they hate condoms because the smell of latex sickens them. To combat the odor, DKT International, a United Sates nonprofit, created coffee condoms. These dark brown condoms allegedly (I'm not testing the products) taste and smell like the favorite coffee of Ethiopia -- the macchiato, an espresso with cream and sugar. One college student claimed the smell reminded him of the beauty of Ethiopian women (it's not clear if that's a compliment). These condoms bolster national identity because Ethiopians claim to have invented coffee. DKT International also created flavored and scented condoms for Indonesia (durian fruit) and China (sweet corn). Mental Floss: 4 fruits we're dying to try . 3. Condom trees . In western Australia, the rate of HIV infection is the highest in the nation. When public health nurses were looking for an effective way to distribute condoms, someone suggested trees. Young people in the countryside hang out under trees, so the shady spots are the perfect places for nurses to hang condom-filled canisters. Over 3,000 condoms are taken each month. Residents said grabbing condoms from trees was convenient and private. Additionally, officials in Australia piloted programs where Aboriginal teens sold packets of condoms and kept half of the proceeds. Officials tout these programs as a success because STD rates have fallen, yet nurses wonder how they will convince people that they shouldn't have multiple partners. Maybe a monogamy tree is in the Outback's future. Mental Floss: 8 smooches that (sort of) shook the world . 4. Scare tactics . Perhaps some safe sex programs skirt the issue -- unprotected sex causes HIV, which leads to AIDS and often death. It's not surprising that a condom company would resort to scare tactics. The Tulipan Company launched its \"Be Careful\" ads in Argentina. Showing skeletons positioned in flagrante delicto, these ads make no bones about how important it is to wear a condom while engaging in coitus. No word if the skeleton ads have had the desired impact, though the graphic skeletons appear more popular than recent Trojan ads, which depict men as swine. Mental Floss: Strange gravestones . 5. Spray-on protection . Since his teens, Jan Vinzenz Krause struggled to find a condom that fit correctly. He thought the pursuit of the perfect prophylactic was hopeless -- until he went to the carwash. Inspired by the spray-on soap and wax, the German Krause developed a spray-on latex condom, which he claims always fits perfectly and feels natural. However, many men find the design off-putting; the spray-on condom comes in a hard phallic case. Men slide themselves into the cylinder and layer on the latex, providing full coverage. The Jolly Joe, as Krause dubbed it, frightened many men during the testing phase -- they only put the case on their fingers. (Spray on gloves anyone?) Others felt the loud hissing wasn't sexy and the latex takes too long to dry -- three minutes. Krause explains to Time, \"It needs to be ready in five to ten seconds.\" So for now, Krause is waiting for a quicker-drying latex. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

A French warship keeps guard over commerical vessels in the Gulf of Aden last week. \"The pirates are living between life and death,\" said the pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah. \"Who can stop them? Americans and British all put together cannot do anything.\" The interview with the pirate was conducted in late August by journalists employed by the Somali news organization Garowe Online. The complete interview was provided to CNN last week and provides a glimpse of why piracy has been so hard to control in the region. Recorded on grainy video, the interview took place in the Somali port city of Eyl, now a center of pirate operations. Eyl is on the east coast of Somalia in the autonomous territory of Puntland. It is a largely lawless zone, considered extremely dangerous for Westerners to enter. The Puntland government said two unidentified Western journalists were taken hostage Wednesday as they attempted to report on pirate activity. Boyah said that the piracy began because traditional coastal fishing became difficult after foreign fishing trawlers depleted local fish stocks. Traditional fishermen started attacking the trawlers until the trawler crews fought back with heavy weapons. The fishermen then turned to softer targets.  Watch why fishermen turned to piracy \u00bb . \"We went into the deep ocean and hijacked the unarmed cargo ships,\" Boyah said. \"For the past three years, we have not operated near the Somali coast. We have operated at least 80 miles [out], in international waters.\" When merchant shipping started avoiding the Somali coast, Boyah said, \"we went to ships traveling other routes.\" Over the past year, the number of pirate attacks has increased dramatically. The International Maritime Bureau cites more than 90 pirate attacks off East Africa so far in 2008. When attacks are successful, the hijacked ships are taken to Somali waters, where the ships and crew are held until a ransom is paid.  See how pirate attacks have increased \u00bb . Ships recently captured include a massive Saudi supertanker laden with crude oil valued at more than $100 million and a freighter carrying Russian-built tanks. The hijackings have been profitable. Kenya's foreign minister, Moses Wetangula, estimates the pirates have been paid more than $150 million during the past year. One pirate gang wants $2 million dollars to release a Yemeni freighter and crew seized last week. Facing increasing disruptions through one of the busiest sea lanes in the world, several countries have sent warships to patrol the area. There have been reports of skirmishes between pirates and naval forces, but the military presence does not concern pirate leader Boyah. He boasts the pirates literally sail in a vast ocean beneath the radar of the warships.  Watch how piracy thrives off Somalia \u00bb . \"No ship has the capability to see everything,\" he said. \"A ship can see 80 miles or so [on radar]. It cannot see us at all. No one can do anything about it.\" Boyah said it is unlikely the Puntland regional government would ever crack down on piracy because government officials are involved in financing the piracy and collect a cut of the ransoms. \"They motivate us. It's their money and their weapons,\" Boyah said. \"Thirty percent belongs to them.\" The Puntland foreign minister, Ali Abdi Aware, denied government involvement with the pirates, including taking bribes. The minister cited the arrest of six pirates earlier this year as evidence it is acting to stop piracy. Pirate Boyah said he is unimpressed with the arrests by Puntland authorities. \"The pirates are at sea and Puntland does not approach them. The pirates are on land and Puntland does not approach them,\" Boyah said. \"They arrest some small people and tell the world that they captured pirates, but they are liars.\" While Boyah may have been outspoken about the government's ineffectiveness, he did not allow interviewers to show his face, an indication that even in this lawless country, pirates still have some fear.", "832764ebe6fc018f25e1b0ef4d19d8359130ef29": "UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Rebel forces have declared a cease-fire after four days of fighting in the North Kivu province of eastern Congo, the French ambassador to the United Nations said after Security Council talks on the unfolding humanitarian crisis. Congolese soldiers and displaced civilians move into Goma on Wednesday, fleeing advancing rebels. Laurent Nkunda, the Congolese Tutsi general who leads troops of the National Congress for the Defense of the People, ordered the cease-fire, Ambassador Jean-Maurice Ripert told reporters. \"We hope that it will stand, and we hope that tomorrow Mr. Nkunda will announce that he stops his offensive,\" Ripert said, adding that he expected the the council would condemn the military operation. He called the humanitarian situation \"very alarming,\" said more than 50,000 people \"are on the road,\" and expressed hope that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon would send a high-level envoy to the region for talks \"as soon as possible.\" Representatives of European countries \"are talking together\" about how best to ease the situation, Ripert said. \"We are looking into the most effective and fastest way of helping MONUC,\" he said, using the French acronym for the U.N. mission in Congo.

He said he didn't know where the soldiers were going, but suspected they were headed to areas of heavy fighting. Ban said at midday he was \"alarmed at the escalation of violence\" over the prior 24 hours and warned of a \"humanitarian crisis.\" In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters the agency was sending Assistant Secretary Jendayi Frazer to the region as an envoy. \"We're working as best we can to minimize or defuse the situation, get more troops in there,\" McCormack said. Attacks by CNDP rebels have uprooted hundreds of thousands of displaced people from camps run by the United Nations and other organizations. \"The humanitarian situation is quite dire,\" Mounoubai told CNN by phone from Kinshasa, Congo's capital. \"We have internally displaced people streaming out of camps. Both parties are blocking the U.N. from reaching desperately needy people to evacuate,\" he added. \"I cannot emphasize how desperate the situation on the ground is.\" The region's instability endangers aid workers, some of whom have joined the exodus. Michael Arunga, a spokesman for World Vision, told CNN the organization's workers had fled to the Rwandan border, where they were assessing the situation and caring for civilians crossing into the area. Arunga said he himself had fled from Goma, where he could hear shootings at night. \"For agencies to operate on the ground, we need a peaceful environment,\" he said. Doctors Without Borders said that on Sunday, medical teams in Rutshuru treated 70 wounded, and had been working round the clock since. Some of the people who sought help had been on the run for weeks, said the group, which described the situation as \"extremely volatile.\" Doctors have been working mostly in towns and camps in and around Kitchanga, Masisi, Mweso, Nyanzale and Kayna.

John \"Junior\" Gotti, seen in September 2006, has had three criminal trials end in mistrials. Gotti was among six people indicted by a Florida grand jury, said Robert O'Neill, U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Florida. The indictments were unsealed Tuesday with the arrest of five defendants, including Gotti, he said. Negotiations were under way for the surrender of the sixth person named in the indictment, O'Neill said. All six suspects were charged under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, a law used to target organized crime groups -- in this case, the Gambino crime family. Gotti appeared Tuesday afternoon before a judge, who ordered him held without bail. His attorney, Charles Carnesi, told reporters the charges against his client were baseless. \"I can guarantee you that this case will be based on people who have been convicted of various crimes who do not want to go to jail,\" Carnesi said outside the courthouse. \"Let's face it, they have the money, they have the resources, they have an army of agents and most of all they have the ability to go to people who are willing to lie and say, 'OK, here's the key. Here's the way out.' \"  Watch authorities talk about 'significant evidence' \u00bb . The indictment alleges Gotti was involved in three slayings in New York City -- those of George Grosso, who died in December 1988 in Queens; Louis DiBono, killed in October 1990 in the parking garage of the former World Trade Center; and Bruce John Gotterup, slain in November 1991 at the Boardwalk at the Rockaways in Queens. Gotti is the first person charged in Grosso's death, which was listed as an unsolved homicide and was investigated with assistance from the New York Police Department's Cold Case Squad, O'Neill said in a written statement. Gotti is charged in one indictment, and the five others in another one. Watch Gotti being led away in handcuffs . Carnesi said he was surprised by the judge's decision to hold Gotti without bail. He said it would be his preference to keep Gotti in New York as long as possible \"so that we can maintain contact with him\" and suggested he enter his not-guilty plea by video to the Florida court. Gotti, 44, of Oyster Bay, New York, has served as an associate, soldier, captain and de facto boss in the organization, the indictment alleges, as well as a member of a captains' committee formed in the early 1990s to assist in the administration of the family. His co-defendants are John Burke, 47, a New York prison inmate; James Cadicamo, 33, of Tampa, Florida; David D'Arpino, 33, of Howard Beach, New York; Michael Finnerty, 43, of Oceanside, New York; and Guy Peden, 47, of Wantagh, New York. Burke and Peden are also accused of participating in the murder of Gotterup, according to authorities, and Burke and D'Arpino are charged in the death of John Gebert, who was killed in 1996 in Queens. In addition, Cadicamo is charged with conspiring to beat or kill a man named Michael Malone to prevent Malone's testimony in a case, and with retaliating against Malone for his cooperation with authorities. A number of cases culminated in the indictment, which names people in Florida and New York, the prosecutor said. \"I think what you have here is, you have the Gambino crime family reaching out to Tampa, Florida\" and \"trying to gain a foothold,\" he said. All six defendants face a maximum sentence of life in prison, authorities said. If convicted of the charges involving Malone, Cadicamo could face the death penalty. \"[Gambino crime family] enterprise members engaged in public acts and displays of violence -- shootings, stabbings, baseball bat beatings and murder -- designed to create and maintain fear and dread in others so that the GCF enterprise could defend and expand its unlawful dominion and influence in certain geographical areas,\" according to a statement issued by O'Neill's office. \"GCF enterprise members worked to establish and maintain GCF enterprise footholds, or operational bases, in various parts of the United States of America, specifically including the city of Tampa, Florida.\" The Gambino family also is accused of crimes including robbery, bribery, kidnapping, extortion, home invasions and money laundering, among others, authorities said. Members of the organization \"invested some of their criminal income for the acquisition of interests in other businesses,\" including window and glass businesses, valet parking businesses and bars or nightclubs, prosecutors allege. Carnesi questioned why, if Gotti is involved in drug trafficking and murder, informants such as Sammy \"The Bull\" Gravano have never suggested it. \"You can go down the line as to any of these individuals who made deals with the government. ... They don't know anything of this,\" he said. In late 2006, a third mistrial was declared in a federal racketeering case against Gotti. Charges against him included racketeering and extortion. Prosecutors said they would not retry Gotti, who was accused of ordering attacks on radio talk show host Curtis Sliwa after the Guardian Angels founder criticized Gotti's father on his radio show. Sliwa was shot three times but recovered and testified against Gotti. Asked Gotti's feelings on the newest charges, Carnesi said, \"He was very disappointed to have to go through all this again. You can imagine the toll it took on him and his family to have to fight three times in the course of a year, to feel that, OK, perhaps it's over ... because the government itself came to the conclusion, no more. It's very disheartening for him to be back here again.\" Gotti's father, who was nicknamed the \"Teflon Don\" because prosecutors had trouble making charges stick against him, died in prison in 2002 of throat cancer.

File image of the Nautica in Sydney Harbor . The Nautica was in an area patrolled by international anti-piracy task forces when two small skiffs appeared to try to intercept it, Oceania spokesman Tim Rubacky said. The ship took evasive maneuvers and accelerated to its full speed of 23 knots or 27 mph. One of the smaller craft closed to within 300 yards and fired eight rifle shots at the cruise ship, he said, but the ship was able to pull away. It was the first report of a pirate attack on a passenger ship of its size this year, said Cyrus Mody of the International Maritime Bureau, which runs a piracy reporting center. \"There have been a couple of passenger yachts hijacked, but they were much smaller,\" he said. It is \"quite common\" for pirates to target ships the size of the Nautica and even larger, he said, but they tend to be cargo ships, not passenger vessels.  Map of pirate activity in the area \u00bb . The Nautica escaped without damage or injury to its 684 passengers and 400 crew, and arrived safely on schedule in Salalah, Oman early on Monday morning, Rubacky said. He emphasized that the ship was not off the coast of Somalia, which has become a base for pirates, but off the coast of Yemen. The International Maritime Bureau has issued piracy warnings for both areas. The Nautica was in a Maritime Safety Protection Area which is patrolled by international anti-piracy task forces, Rubacky underlined. But the International Maritime Bureau's Mody warned that there was only so much navies could do even in that zone. \"The zone has been created to enable navies to patrol and concentrate on a much smaller area than the entire Gulf,\" he said. \"But, saying that, it is still a large area. Vessels do not automatically get guaranteed safe passage even if they use it.\" The Nautica left Rome November 18 on a 32-day cruise to Singapore. It was the first time one of the company's cruise ships had encountered possible pirates, Rubacky added. He said the company did not plan to change routes to avoid the area, which has seen increasingly audacious piracy in recent months. \"We're not considering re-routing as the Gulf of Aden is the most viable gateway from the Med to Asia,\" he said. On Sunday, an official from the Kenya Seafarers Association said pirates have reached a deal with the owners of a Ukrainian ship loaded with arms that was seized more than two months ago. \"A deal has been reached to free the MV Faina. Talks on how to deliver the ransom money are ongoing,\" Andrew Mwangura of the association told CNN. It is not clear how long those talks will take, but the ship could be freed as soon as an agreement has been reached. The ship, which is laden with Soviet-era tanks, tank artillery shells, grenade launchers and small arms, was seized on September 25. It was heading for Kenya, whose government had bought the weapons from Ukraine, Ukrainian Defense Minister Yuri Yekhanurov said, according to the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. The pirates originally asked for a $35 million ransom, but lowered their demand to $20 million, he said. The Faina is owned and operated by Kaalbye Shipping Ukraine, and its crew includes citizens of Ukraine, Russia and Latvia, the Navy said.", "42c7f11b530e58acc7e0f93c30a92e0d6380d13b": "(CNN) -- Breakaway conservative members of the Episcopal Church in the United States and its Canadian counterpart are expected to formally announce Wednesday the formation of a rival North American Anglican church. The consecration of Rev. Gene Robinson as bishop of New Hampshire left many conservatives disaffected. Leaders of the Common Cause Partnership, a network of more than 100,000 Anglican Christians in North America, are expected to unveil a draft constitution for a new ecclesiastical territorial division, or province, at an evening service in Wheaton Evangelical Free Church in Wheaton, Illinois, the group said in a written statement. \"The public release of our draft constitution is an important concrete step toward the goal of a biblical, missionary and united Anglican Church in North America,\" Bishop Robert Duncan of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, diocese, said in the written statement. The move comes after years of debate over issues from the interpretation of the Bible to homosexuality. Tensions reached a boiling point in 2003, when the Episcopal Church consecrated an openly gay man, Rev. Gene Robinson, as bishop of New Hampshire. The move outraged worshippers with traditionalist tendencies, and since then, four dioceses and several parishes have left the Episcopalian Church, including Duncan's Pittsburgh diocese. In all, the newly formed division will consist of about 100,000 members from the secessionist dioceses and parishes, along with splinter groups that had left the Episcopalian Church in earlier years, said Robert Lundy, a spokesman for the group . \"This constitution brings them back together under one church, all aligned together,\" Lundy said. \"This is all these folks coming back together.\" Lunday said it was safe to say Duncan will lead the nascent province. An assembly is likely to be called next year to determine additional leadership, he said. The Rev. Dr. Charles K. Robertson, canon to the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, Katharine Jefferts Schori, issued a statement saying it would not hazard a guess as to the consequences of Wednesday's service. \"We will not predict what will or will not come out of this meeting, but simply continue to be clear that the Episcopal Church, along with the Anglican Church of Canada and the La Iglesia Anglicana de Mexico, comprise the official, recognized presence of the Anglican Communion in North America,\" he said. \"We reiterate what has been true of Anglicanism for centuries: that there is room within the Episcopal Church for people with different views, and we regret that some have felt the need to depart from the diversity of our common life in Christ.\" The Episcopal Church is part of the Anglican Communion, which is composed of 38 provinces around the world. It was not immediately clear which of the other provinces would recognize the Anglican Church in North America, but Lundy said in a meeting last year in Jerusalem indicated that some would do so. Lundy said the draft constitution will state the province's core beliefs and doctrine. He said it will not lay out definite policies for issues the leaders disagree on, such as ordaining women.", "f9b8fa31280fde49f82022a1dacb92a5c600af74": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Two customers are suing Wal-Mart for negligence after being injured in a mad rush for post-Thanksgiving bargains that left one store employee dead, the men's attorney said Tuesday. A temporary worker at this Wal-Mart was crushed to death when shoppers rushed into the store last week. Temporary Wal-Mart worker Jdimytai Damour, 34, was crushed to death as he and other employees attempted to unlock the doors of a store on Long Island at 5 a.m. Friday. Attorney Kenneth Mollins said Fritz Mesadieu and Jonathan Mesadieu were \"literally carried from their position outside the store\" and are now \"suffering from pain in their neck and their back from being caught in that surge of people\" that rushed into the Wal-Mart. New York Newsday reported that the Mesadieus are father and son, ages 51 and 19. The lawsuit alleges that the Mesadieus' injuries were a result of \"carelessness, recklessness, negligence.\" In a claim against the Nassau County police department, the men also contend that they \"sustained monetary losses as a result of health care and legal expenses ... in the sum of $2 million.\" \"This is a tragic situation that could have and should have been avoided with the exercise of reasonable care. There are very simple measures that could have been put in place to avoid this, such as barriers along the line to spread people out, extra security and a better police presence,\" Mollins said. He said his clients and others who were at the scene contend that the police \"were there ... saw what was happening, and they left.\" Calls seeking comment from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. were not immediately returned. Lt. Kevin Smith of the Nassau County Police Department said, \"it's our policy that we don't comment on open litigations\" and would not respond directly to Mollins and his clients' claim that officers left the scene. He said it is \"incumbent upon the store to provide security\" but noted that there was no security force present when officers responded to an initial phone call after 3 a.m. Friday for an unknown disturbance at the site. Smith said the officers noticed a lack of order with the crowd and began to organize them into a line, remaining on site for about 30 minutes until the crowd had become orderly. Throughout the morning, officers went back to check on the crowd and continued to notice no disturbance, Smith said. He said that there were no additional calls for assistance until about 5 a.m., when people began rushing the doors of the store and trampled Damour. An autopsy showed that Damour died of asphyxiation after being trampled, Nassau County officials have said. Video showed that as many as a dozen people were knocked to the floor in the stampede of people trying to get into the store. The employee was \"stepped on by hundreds of people\" as other workers attempted to fight their way through the crowd, said Nassau County Police Detective Lt. Michael Fleming.

Under a plea deal, Christine Beatty, shown in August at an arraignment in Detroit, will serve five years probation. Beatty pleaded guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice, according to Maria Miller, the prosecutor's spokeswoman. Charges of perjury and misconduct against Beatty will be dropped as part of the plea arrangement, she said. Beatty agreed to a plea arrangement under which she will serve five years probation -- the first 120 days to be served in jail -- and pay a $100,000 fine, \"based on [Beatty's] ability to pay,\" Miller said. Beatty will begin serving her jail sentence on January 5, when she will be formally sentenced, Miller said. Kym L. Worthy, prosecuting attorney for Wayne County, released a statement saying she is \"very pleased that this defendant admitted her guilt.\" \"We live in an age where greed and protecting one's secrets is glorified and accepted,\" Worthy said. \"Now the city of Detroit, the region and the state of Michigan can truly begin to move forward when this ugly chapter in Detroit's history is put to rest.\" In September, Kilpatrick resigned as mayor and pleaded guilty to two felony obstruction of justice charges stemming from his efforts to cover up his relationship with Beatty. Like Beatty, Kilpatrick was sentenced to five years probation with the first four months to be served in jail. He is serving that sentence in the Wayne County jail. At the time of his sentencing in October, the judge in the case called Kilpatrick \"arrogant and defiant,\" particularly for a televised speech that aired hours after Kilpatrick entered his pleas. \"That night, the community expected to hear a message of humility, remorse and apology,\" Wayne County Circuit Judge David Groner said at Kilpatrick's sentencing. \"Instead, we heard an arrogant and defiant man who accused the governor, among others, for his downfall.\" In addition to his jail and probation sentence, Kilpatrick must also pay the city of Detroit $1 million in restitution, and forfeit any future pension. Initially, Kilpatrick was accused of blocking a criminal investigation into his office and firing a police deputy to cover up an affair with Beatty, then his chief of staff. When that deputy, Gary Brown, filed a whistle-blower suit, Kilpatrick and Beatty denied under oath that an affair had taken place between them. Text messages that contradicted Kilpatrick's and Beatty's denials of an affair were made public in January by the Detroit Free Press, and county prosecutor Worthy charged Kilpatrick and Beatty with multiple counts of perjury, obstruction of justice and misconduct in office. The most serious charges would have carried a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison upon conviction. Beatty resigned her post after the text messages were made public. Kilpatrick initially refused to resign after the scandal broke, and Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm called a hearing on whether she should remove him from office at the request of the Detroit City Council. Granholm adjourned those hearings after Kilpatrick pleaded guilty and resigned in September.", "f63593be113f81d3d691773dd02224583b864b71": "Editor's Note: Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is founder of The Carter Center, a not-for-profit organization that seeks to \"prevent and resolve conflicts, enhance freedom and democracy, and improve health.\" Read more on human rights defenders: http://www.cartercenter.org/homepage.html . Jimmy Carter says closing Guantanamo Bay and ending torture would send a strong message. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It has been heartening to witness the outpouring of worldwide enthusiasm over the election of Barack Obama as the next president of the United States, a transformational moment for our country. Our incoming president has huge challenges ahead of him, and he will undoubtedly reach out to other world leaders to help address the most difficult problems. A high priority will be the restoration of human rights, which have been badly eroded in recent years. President-elect Obama has reiterated his decision to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention center and end U.S.-sponsored torture. Also under discussion is the establishment by the U.S. government of an independent commission to examine the actions that led to these shameful policies and practices. Together, these steps would signal a renewed commitment to the cause of universal human rights long championed by the United States. As this year marks the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the reassertion of these fundamental rights is necessary. While the U.S. government has much work to do in this regard, there will have to be a concerted international effort to achieve meaningful protection of human rights, even as the issue of security continues to demand our attention. The American people and our courts have rejected the proposition that some people's rights can be suspended arbitrarily; to do so violates the very core of our democracy. Hopefully, those working to establish democratic practices and institutions worldwide will seize upon this development and convince their own fellow citizens that democracy and human rights are worth the struggle. The international community, including a newly energized United States, should move swiftly and decisively to support the local heroes who risk much to advance this cause. Human rights defenders from throughout the world are participating in our annual conference at The Carter Center this week to share the challenges they face, and to decide how the international community can best support their efforts. For years, these activists have told us that when the United States engaged in torture and indefinite detention, their decades of struggle for rights began to erode. Dictators who had felt pressure from the United States to improve rights were suddenly off the hook. With new leadership in Washington, a clear and principled message on the centrality of human rights can help set a new tone. Too often, the international community has failed to respond to emerging crises, partly because voices of the oppressed are missing in policy discussions. Had the international community heeded the warning of human rights defenders in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Darfur, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, more robust and coordinated diplomacy and even limited intervention may have averted these crises. Catastrophic conditions exist in Congo, Zimbabwe, Sudan, Myanmar, Afghanistan and elsewhere and will require unprecedented cooperation to resolve. It is time to embrace the idea that when human beings are systematically abused, international peace and security are inherently threatened. In such situations, the global community should spare no effort to help societies in distress. Crises like these can be assuaged before they escalate if there is determined global leadership and cooperation. Human rights defenders are on the frontlines of this battle, and we must protect them when they face danger because of their work. We must do a better job of listening to their diagnoses of issues and be receptive to their proposed solutions. And we must strengthen their voices and help to protect them in a collective, undeniable commitment to create the world of peace and freedom that many of us enjoy and we all desire.

A growing percentage of Somalia's population has become dependent on humanitarian aid. \"The Somali people are going through unbearable hardship,\" said Pascal Hundt, head of the ICRC's delegation for Somalia, in a written statement. \"We are witnessing the worst tragedy of the past decade in Somalia.\" Somalia's last severe famine, from 1991 to 1993, devastated crops, killed between 240,000 and 280,000 people and displaced up to 2 million, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Humanitarian workers view Somalia's food crisis as one of the worst in the world. With winds ripping though the country, hundreds of thousands of Somalis are finding their crops as dry as the surrounding landscape, preventing harvests, killing livestock and leading to a mass risk of starvation. The continual armed conflicts in central and south Somalia have aggravated the situation, hindering people from accessing shelter and medical attention. A growing percentage of the population has become dependent on humanitarian aid. The ICRC, World Food Program and CARE plan to deliver four months worth of food to 435,000 Somalis within the next few weeks. International donors are being asked by the ICRC to provide some of the emergency money. Aid includes giving blankets, kitchen sets and other shelter supplies to 150,000 people. The WFP will be increasing the amount it spends in Somalia to $163 million in food assistance, the group said at a U.N. conference in Rome Wednesday. In addition to drought and armed conflict, high inflation on food and fuel have also exacerbated the situation. Similar factors have affected other developing nations in Africa and other parts of the world. Ethiopia's food crisis has affected 4.5 million people, said the United Nations Children's Fund. As a result of widespread food shortages and little rainfall, an estimated 126,000 children are in need of medical assistance to combat severe malnutrition, while the WFP projects $193 million will be needed for urgent food distributions.", "0730a5921e9a2fde0e36821da355c412f26b9b8b": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama plans to nominate New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson to be secretary of commerce, a Democratic source told CNN on Tuesday. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination this year. The former Democratic presidential candidate's name has been bandied about as the next head of Commerce. Obama spoke with Richardson about the position November 14, a senior Democratic source said. The source said Richardson has always been on Obama's list of possibilities for the key Cabinet position. Richardson, 61, also traveled to Chicago, Illinois, in November to meet with Obama, according to a source. \"He brings to this plate, in particular in an era where the economy is the focus of attention, a lot of skills that could be put to use -- perhaps opening up marketplaces for U.S. products abroad,\" CNN senior political correspondent Candy Crowley said. \"In New Mexico, he sought to bring in new businesses and to create jobs ... so the Obama team considers this part of the economic team.\" One of the most prominent Hispanic politicians in the nation, Richardson withdrew from the race for the Democratic presidential nomination January 10 and later endorsed Obama. He has served as a U.N. ambassador and as energy secretary in the Clinton administration. If Richardson steps down as chief executive of New Mexico, Democratic Lt. Gov. Diane Denish takes over. She was Richardson's running mate in the 2002 and 2006 gubernatorial elections. It's a very different situation in neighboring Arizona, where another Democratic governor, Janet Napolitano, is also stepping down to join the Cabinet. Arizona doesn't have a lieutenant governor. Under state law, Secretary of State Jan Brewer -- a Republican -- takes over. Richardson sought the Democratic presidential nomination but dropped out of the race after a poor showing in the January 8 New Hampshire primary. Declaring that Obama is an \"extraordinary American,\" Richardson endorsed Obama to be the Democratic nominee for president March 21. \"Barack Obama will make a great and historic president,\" Richardson said at a rally in Portland, Oregon, with Obama at his side. \"[It] is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our nation, and you are a once-in-a-lifetime leader.\" Obama said, \"I am extraordinarily grateful to have the support of one of the great public servants of these United States.\" \"He's done the kind of work that you want from your public servants, somebody who's driven not just by raw ambition, not just by an interest in personal aggrandizement,\" Obama added. \"He's been somebody who's been motivated by the desire to make the lives of his constituents and working people a little bit better.\" Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton both lobbied Richardson for his endorsement. Richardson said that his \"affection for Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton will never waver\" but that \"it is now time for a new generation of leadership.\" Obama \"can bring us the change we so desperately need by bringing us together as a nation here at home and with our allies abroad,\" he said. Hillary Clinton was named this week as Obama's pick for another Cabinet post: secretary of state. Richardson caused controversy in Democratic circles with his endorsement of Obama this year. In April, Richardson said he was \"very close to endorsing\" Clinton but decided not to after the campaign became negative. His endorsement was viewed as an act of betrayal by some longtime Clinton supporters. CNN political analyst James Carville, who has close ties to both Clintons, likened Richardson's endorsement to Judas' betrayal of Christ. Richardson responded to Carville's criticisms by saying that Carville and other Clinton supporters believe they are a \"dynasty\" and that they were \"clinging to the throne.\" CNN's Candy Crowley, Ed Hornick and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.", "defdaaf2d5159884dc35c4b72603c0e57572f284": "(CNN) -- In an age when many people become celebrities through looks or connections, Jennifer Hudson's rise to fame came the old-fashioned way: through talent, hard work and a close-knit family. Jennifer Hudson is in a new movie, \"The Secret Life of Bees,\" and recently released her first solo album. At a time when the singer is in a new movie, \"The Secret Life of Bees,\" and recently released her first solo album, Hudson is now back in the public eye largely due to a family tragedy. Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, and brother, Jason Hudson, were found shot to death Friday in their Chicago home. The body of the singer's missing 7-year-old nephew, Julian King, was found in an SUV on Monday morning. Julian's stepfather, William Balfour, was detained over the weekend for questioning in connection with the case, a police spokesperson told CNN. He was subsequently transferred to prison on a parole violation charge, the spokesperson said. Balfour's mother has acknowledged that her son has been questioned about the shootings, but said he had nothing to do with the crime. No charges had been filed against anyone in connection with the murders. iReport.com: Reaction to Hudson family tragedy . The tragedy is a sad turn for the 27-year-old actress and singer, who first earned national notice for her performances on \"American Idol\" in 2004 and won an Oscar for best supporting actress for 2006's \"Dreamgirls.\" Hudson's singing career began in her church choir in the South Side Chicago neighborhood of Englewood when she was a child. She remained devoted to singing all the way through Chicago's Dunbar Vocational High School, where there is now a Jennifer Hudson Room. (She's in good company; Dunbar's alumni include Lou Rawls and two of the Staple Singers.) \"People would say it was unusual for such a small girl to have such a big voice,\" she told Reuters in 2006. \"They would say, 'She sounds like she's grown.' \" After finishing school, she performed in the musical \"Big River\" at a Chicago-area dinner theater and took a job on a cruise line. In 2003, she auditioned for \"American Idol\" in Atlanta, Georgia, and managed to earn her way to the top-rated show with a performance of \"Easy to be Hard,\" the \"Hair\" ballad popularized by Three Dog Night. \"Idol\" proved to be an uneven experience for Hudson. After the show narrowed down its 12 finalists, she started slowly, at times almost being voted off, but eventually her song choices -- including Elton John's \"Circle of Life\" and Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" -- made her one of the favorites. Sir Elton himself believed she was the \"best of the lot.\" 'Idol' friend speaks out about Hudson case . In the end, Hudson didn't even come close to making \"Idol's\" final two, being voted off midway in the show's run. However, her performances had established her as a talent to watch, and in May 2005 -- several months after finishing the traditional post-\"Idol\" group tour -- she was contacted by a casting agency about the part of Effie, the tragic soul of \"Dreamgirls.\" In the musical, which concerns an all-girl trio much like the Supremes, Effie is a weight-challenged musical powerhouse who begins as the group's leader but is dropped as both performer and lover by the group's manager for the more statuesque singer Deena. The role features the musical's showstopping song, \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,\" and won Jennifer Holliday a Tony Award when \"Dreamgirls\" ran on Broadway. Hudson was unfamiliar with \"Dreamgirls\" when she auditioned, but she allegedly beat out almost 800 other women for the role -- including her former \"Idol\" rival, Fantasia Barrino, who had been the third-season winner. The role's high-pitched emotions were a challenge, Hudson told the Chicago Sun-Times in 2006. \"I had to find a way into it,\" she said to the newspaper. \"[Director] Bill Condon sent me into 'Diva 101.' He told me I was too nice. So I'd come into the room angry, but tell all the ADs, 'Bill told me to do this. This is Effie and not Jennifer.' I had to learn how to separate myself from the character with that attitude. That was Bill's main concern. Effie had to have that edge.\" Her performance won her across-the-board raves. Variety compared her turn to Barbra Streisand's award-winning debut in \"Funny Girl,\" among others. It also led to a host of awards, including supporting actress honors from the New York Critics Circle, Golden Globes, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and -- finally -- the Academy Awards. At the Oscar show, Hudson tearfully thanked her grandmother, whom she described as her \"biggest inspiration.\" Julia Kate Hudson, who sang at Pleasant Gift Missionary Baptist Church, where Hudson got her start, died in 1998. Since winning the Oscar, Hudson has been a mainstay of celebrity magazines, which have broadcast news of her engagement to \"I Love New York 2\" contestant David Otunga, regularly singled her out as an example of a healthy plus-sized body type and held her up as an \"Idol\" made good. She's continued her movie career with performances in \"Sex and the City: The Movie\" and \"The Secret Life of Bees,\" both of which came out in 2008. She sang the national anthem at the Democratic National Convention in August at the personal request of Sen. Barack Obama's campaign. According to many reports, Hudson has remained humble amid all the attention. She remains devoted to the church -- \"Church is where I'm from. It will always be my favorite place to sing, and that's where I'd like to go back to,\" Hudson told the Sun-Times -- and uses her against-all-odds biography to inspire others. \"I've had a similar journey as Effie,\" Hudson told the Sun-Times. \"Me being a part of 'Idol,' her being part of the group. ... We both go through our journeys, trying to hold on to our dream and achieve our goal. We have hardships, but we prevail at the end.\"", "2415f9252573bc973cd6ccd3907e6f85ce271da6": "KFAR CHABAD, Israel (CNN) -- Thousands of mourners and emissaries from the ultra-Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement poured into an Israeli village Tuesday for the funerals of two people killed in the Mumbai terrorist attacks. Israeli girls mourn Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivkah, who were killed in the Mumbai attacks. There was a feeling of pain and anger at the funeral in Kfar Chabad, a village of 900 families just outside Tel Aviv. Speeches at the funeral said the gunmen sought out the Chabad House in Mumbai and targeted the victims because of their faith. The two people laid to rest Tuesday were Chabad House directors Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife, Rivka. They lived and worked at the house in Mumbai, which served as both a home and Jewish center -- a place open to anyone who wanted a place to pray, eat kosher food, or celebrate Jewish holidays. Three former Israeli prime ministers were at the funeral: Ehud Barak, who is now the defense minister; Shimon Peres, currently the Israeli president; and Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the Likud Party.  Watch Israeli funerals for those killed in Mumbai \u00bb . After the funeral, the bodies of the Holtzbergs were buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. Another victim from Chabad House, kosher supervisor Rabbi Leibish Teitelbaum of New York, was buried there earlier. Separate funerals were held for Teitelbaum and another kosher supervisor at Chabad House, American-Israeli Rabbi Bentzion Kruman. They died in the siege along with Israeli grandmother Yocheved Orpaz and Mexican citizen Norma Shvarzblat Rabinovich. The building, also known as the Nariman House, was the local headquarters of the Chabad community, a Hasidic Jewish movement. The Holtzbergs had two children, one of whom was in the house when terrorists stormed in. A woman who worked as a nanny and cook at the house managed to escape with the 2-year-old boy, Moshe.  Watch report about nanny saving infant \u00bb . The couple's other son was not in Mumbai at the time, according to Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, chairman of the educational and social services arms of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. The child has Tay-Sachs, a terminal genetic disease, The Associated Press reports. In an emotional scene before flying from India to Israel on Monday, the boy repeatedly cried for his mother at a memorial ceremony at a Mumbai synagogue. His cries were played repeatedly on Israeli TV stations. \"You don't have a mother who will hug you and kiss you,\" Rabbi Kotlarsky said, adding that the community would take care of the boy, AP said. \"You are the child of all of Israel.\" The only other surviving member of the family, Moshe's brother, has Tay-Sachs, a terminal genetic disease, and is institutionalized in Israel, AP added. The Holtzbergs' eldest son died of the disease. The Holtzbergs went to Mumbai five years ago to serve the city's small Jewish community and the thousands of Israeli visitors and business people who frequent the area, according to Chabad.org, the ultra-Orthodox group's Web site. About 5,000 Jews live in India, according to the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise. About 3,000 of them live in Mumbai, The Jewish Press reported. iReport.com: Share tributes to those who died . The Holtzbergs operated a synagogue and taught Torah classes. The rabbi also conducted weddings for local Jewish couples. Gavriel Holtzberg, 29, was born in Israel and moved to Brooklyn, New York, when he was 9. He studied in New York and Argentina and traveled to Thailand and China as a rabbinical student. His wife, Rivka, 28, was a native of Israel. In Mumbai, they ran the headquarters of the Chabad community, a Hasidic Jewish movement. The center, in a building known as the Nariman House, was open to anyone who wanted a place to pray, eat kosher food or celebrate Jewish holidays. In footage filmed two years ago by the Chabad movement, Gavriel Holtzberg said anybody who visited the center was welcome. His wife said its doors were always open and that it was not unusual to have 30 people for dinner. The Chabad-Lubavitch movement was formed more than two centuries ago in Russia. The organization says 4,000 full-time emissary families now direct more than 3,300 Chabad institutions around the world. Kruman was in India to help Teitelbaum supervise a mushroom packing plant under kosher certification, the Chabad Web site said. He grew up in Israel and in the past year had visited China once a month to supervise food packaging plants there. Kruman often visited the Chabad House in Beijing, the organization said, and survived the May earthquake in China's Sichuan Province. He leaves behind a widow and three children.

The French frigate Nivose escorts commercial ships in the Gulf of Aden on November 28, 2008. The men were rescued by the HDMS Absalon on Wednesday after being found in a powerless skiff with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47s aboard, Danish Navy spokesman Jesper Lynge told CNN. They were found approximately 75 nautical miles (140 km) off the coast of Yemen following a distress call, Lynge said. \"These guys had been without propulsion on their small boat for several days without food or drinking water,\" he added. After receiving medical treatment aboard the Absalon, the ship's crew turned them over to Yemen's coast guard Friday morning, said Rasmus Tantholt, a reporter for Denmark's TV2, who was aboard the warship. The skiff's small engine was broken, and the Danish vessel sank the boat in order to prevent any hazard to sea traffic.  Watch how NATO is fighting piracy \u00bb . The men are suspected to be pirates because of the weapons on board, Lynge said. Pirates frequently use small boats to attack commercial vessels with small arms and grenades, but Lynge said Absalon crew could not connect the men \"directly with another pirate attack in the area,\" Lynge said. Lynge said the skiff was found in Yemeni waters, and the Absalon crew was instructed to hand over the men to the Yemen Coast Guard. Yemeni authorities must conduct any investigation because the episode took place in their jurisdiction, he said. CNN was unable to obtain an immediate comment from Yemeni authorities. Pirates have seized many ships in recent weeks in the waters of the Gulf of Aden, which separates Yemen from Somalia. So far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off the coast of Somalia and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau. A multinational fleet, including vessels from the United States, NATO member states, Russia and India, has been patrolling waters of Indian Ocean near the Gulf, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Around 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year.

It's a disease that affects the bowels and in its most severe form is characterized by acute watery diarrhoea that can lead to immediate death through severe dehydration and kidney failure. A man from Zimbabwe wheels his sick relative to a cholera clinic. Almost 12,000 people have contracted cholera since August in Zimbabwe, and the outbreak threatens to kill even greater numbers as the water situation becomes more desperate. Unicef says it plans on providing a month's supply of water treatment chemicals for the capital Harare where water supply has been cut off because the government of Robert Mugabe is unable to buy chemicals needed to clean tap water. With the world's eyes on Zimbabwe where it is estimated that more than 500 people have already died , many myths and misconceptions abound about cholera. CNN compiles some crucial cholera facts: . --Unlike other diarrhoeal diseases, cholera can kill a healthy adult within hours. --Cholera's short incubation period of two hours to five days enhances the potential for increased outbreaks . --Seventy-five percent of people infected with cholera do not exhibit any symptoms. --A total of 236 896 cases were reported in 2006, an overall increase of 79% compared with the number of cases reported in 2005 . --People who have HIV or are malnourished have a greater risk of dying from cholera than others. --The disease is mostly spread through contaminated water and food supplies. --The belief that cholera epidemics are caused by dead bodies after a disaster is false. --Cholera remains a problem in almost every developing country . --If untreated, as many as one in two people may die. --The true burden of the disease is grossly underestimated as not all cases are reported.

Alan Mulally, chief executive officer of Ford Motor Co., has reversed course and will accept a salary of $1 a year. The statements came as the Big Three automakers turned in financial plans to Congress, hoping to bolster their requests for $25 billion in bridge loans. GM spokesman Steve Harris said CEO Rick Wagoner had agreed to accept a $1 salary. Harris didn't elaborate. Ford Motor Company said the salary of its CEO, Alan Mulally, would be cut to $1 a year if Ford actually borrowed money from the government. When Mulally appeared before the House Financial Services Committee last month, he said he would not agree to a pay cut. In his previous appearance before Congress, Chrysler CEO Bob Nardelli said he would accept a $1-per-year salary if it helped Chrysler obtain its share of the rescue package. GM plans to display some of its new high-tech cars on Capitol Hill this week, a GM source told CNN. About two weeks ago, congressional Democrats ordered executives of the three automakers to show that they have viable financial turnaround plans when they return later this week to Capitol Hill.  Watch why the Big Three are not all in same situation \u00bb . Ford released details of its turnaround plan in a written statement Tuesday. The automaker said that, based on current business planning assumptions, it  expects its overall and its North American automotive business pre-tax results to break even or be profitable in 2011. The company also released initial details of an accelerated vehicle electrification plan for a family of hybrids, plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles. The plan includes a Ford full-battery electric vehicle (BEV) in a van for commercial fleet use in 2010 and a BEV sedan in 2011, the statement said. Ford said it plans to invest about $14 billion in the United States on advanced technologies and products to improve fuel efficiency during the next seven years. It also said it will sell its corporate aircraft as part of its cash-improvement plan. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said he would not support a bailout package unless the companies could prove that they would be viable after the bailout. Reid did not commit to holding a vote on the bailout package. \"No one is too big to fail,\" Reid said. \"We hope we can work something out with them.\" One of Reid's aides said the senator had not read the Ford plan yet because he was involved in back-to-back meetings. GM, Ford, and Chrysler already have made sizable cuts in production and staffing throughout the year, with additional cuts expected in the next few months. Their plans were being submitted to  the Democratic chairmen of the committees that will hear the automakers' requests -- Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, whose Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee convenes Thursday, and Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, whose House Financial Services Committee meets Friday. Lawmakers asked the automakers to describe how they will restructure their businesses to become more competitive. In general, the automakers have been asked to describe how much money they have, and how much they need to stay viable in the long term. Their plans also must address how the companies will meet health care and pension obligations to workers. After being criticized during their last trip for arriving in Washington in corporate jets, Mulally and Wagoner are driving to the nation's capital in hybrid cars -- Mulally in a Ford Escape and Wagoner in a Chevrolet Malibu. A Ford executive told CNN the company's plan, 20 to 30 pages long, was being e-mailed to Congress. He said the plan put a heavy emphasis on advanced technologies. Ford is worried, however, that even after doing a \"bang-up job\" on its report, the company may not receive what it needs, the executive said. The atmosphere in Congress was tense before Thanksgiving, he said, adding that he feels \"automakers have become the whipping boy\" for the industry bailout. Automakers are counting on a rebound in demand by 2010. But that could turn out to be unrealistic because of an \"auto bubble\" the Big Three helped to create during the past few years. Cheap financing, easy credit conditions and attractive pricing on cars due to overcapacity in the U.S. auto market caused record sales earlier this decade. Experts agree those three conditions are going to be missing for years to come, and sales will be weaker than normal at least through 2011 or 2012.

Some are wondering what will happen to their homes while others are terrified about never getting out of debt. Ali Velshi responds to CNN viewers' questions about personal finance on \"The Help Line with Ali Velshi.\" CNN's Chief Business Correspondent Ali Velshi answers viewers' money questions on \"The Help Line with Ali Velshi.\" The following is an edited version of the program. Linda in Kentucky: We have two different adjustable rate mortgages on our house and we're starting to get threatening letters about the smaller mortgage. Can the smaller mortgage start foreclosure procedures before the larger one? Ali Velshi: The first mortgage is the first lien against your house. They can actually start foreclosure procedures on the smaller mortgage but it's not typical because the first mortgage holder is going to want to protect its assets. E-mail your own questions to Ali . If you're getting threatening letters, the first thing you need to do is be in constant contact with them. Letters that don't get responded to escalate and once they've started foreclosure procedures it's much harder to get out of it. Judy in Warren, Michigan: I am trying to pay off my four credit cards and I want to totally shut down the three of them that [charge] annual fees. ... What will this do to my credit rating? Velshi: If you close a credit card account, you need to make it clear on your credit report -- you may have to write a letter to them -- that it was closed by you, not that it was closed by someone else. A closed credit card account, particularly when you have a lot of debt, could look like somebody closed it on you and that could be read incorrectly. Typically, if you've closed a credit card account and you've paid off that balance, your amount of available credit has reduced. This means that the amount that you actually owe could be larger in proportion to the amount of your available credit and that could hurt your credit score. The bottom line is you can eliminate the balances on those credit cards if you have the discipline not to spend. This keeps your available credit there and doesn't hurt your credit score. But some people need to literally cut up that card and have the account closed so they don't run up balances on it. It's better to pay off your credit card debt regardless of what you're planning to do with the credit card. Terae in North Carolina: My wife and I are thinking about taking advantage of the economy and investing in a property. I'm a risk-taker and want to buy two properties but my wife doesn't want to buy any. We don't have any debt, so should we take advantage of this opportunity or do something more conservative? Velshi: You're in a great situation. Properties tend to be a good investment over time. It kind of depends on where you're buying and what kind of property. But you have to be prepared to handle the nuances of owning a property: the upkeep it's going to take and the fact that you could sit around without renting it for some time.  Watch Ali Velshi talk about money \u00bb . I'm not sure I'm a big fan of money being invested in something that's not getting you some returns. I don't see the point of buying a property and keeping it vacant unless you absolutely know it's going to skyrocket in value -- and remember what happened the last few years with people who absolutely knew it was going to skyrocket in value. I would read a good book on it. Buying a property is a good option but there are many other forms of investments that will satisfy your need for risk and perhaps make your wife feel less exposed.", "b952860ec43f9604c6ab3240b0749494d49a486f": "(CNN)  -- The suspect in the death of a 20-year-old pregnant Marine will be returned to North Carolina to face charges in her slaying, a Mexican judge ruled Thursday, according to North Carolina authorities. U.S. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean was arrested in Mexico in April. U.S. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean, 21, who was arrested in Mexico in April, could be returned to Onslow County, North Carolina, within a week, the county sheriff's office said in a statement issued Thursday. Federal authorities will handle his transportation to the North Carolina jail. Laurean has been indicted on first-degree murder and other charges in the death of Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach. Her charred body and that of her fetus were found beneath a fire pit in Laurean's backyard near Camp Lejeune, where both were stationed, in January, a month after she was last seen. Prosecutors allege that Laurean killed Lauterbach on December 14 and used her ATM card 10 days later before fleeing to Mexico to avoid prosecution. Laurean was arrested in April in San Juan Vina, in the Mexican state of Michoacan. Because he holds citizenship in the United States and Mexico, he could not be immediately deported and had to go through the extradition process, authorities said. Asked by a Mexican reporter at the time of his arrest whether he killed Lauterbach, Laurean said, \"I loved her.\" As part of the effort to apprehend Laurean, authorities seized a computer belonging to his sister-in-law that Laurean's wife, Christina, was using to communicate with him, a law enforcement official had said. If convicted, Onslow County prosecutors said, Laurean would face a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. Mexico's extradition policy prohibits U.S. authorities from seeking the death penalty against fugitives it hands over. Authorities found Lauterbach's body after Christina Laurean produced a note her husband had written claiming that the 20-year-old woman slit her own throat during an argument, according to officials. Although a gaping 4-inch wound was found on the left side of Lauterbach's neck, autopsy results indicate that the wound itself would not have been fatal. Prosecutors have said there was no evidence that Christina Laurean was involved in or aware of Lauterbach's slaying before she gave the note to authorities. Lauterbach had accused Laurean of raping her, and it is unclear whether he was the father of her fetus, although her relatives have said they believe him to be. He had denied the rape allegation and said he had had no sexual contact with her. Mary Lauterbach, the young woman's mother, has said she's unconvinced that the Marine Corps took her daughter's rape allegation and other allegations of \"harassment\" seriously. Her daughter's car was keyed, she said, and she was assaulted. \"Those particular actions should have been taken much more seriously because the Marines were aware of them,\" she said Friday. In a statement issued after her death, the Marine Corps said Laurean's denial \"was believed to be significant evidence.\"", "2f422a72066f7f7060d68852093fdb6abeee958c": "JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The world knows her as the daring nanny who, clutching a 2-year-old boy, pushed past the havoc in a terrorized Mumbai and risked her life to keep the toddler safe.

She found the child crying as he stood between his parents, who she says appeared unconscious but still alive. Based on the marks on Moshe's back, she believes he was struck so hard by a gunman that he fell unconscious at some point as well. \"First thing is that a baby is very important for me and this baby is something very precious to me and that's what made me just not think anything -- just pick up the baby and run,\" Samuel said. \"When I hear gunshot, it's not one or 20.

Villeneuve's Williams was the class of the 1997 field but mistakes had blighted his campaign and Schumacher's brilliance had put him ahead by one point by the last race in Jerez, Spain. Vaulting poleman Villeneuve at the lights, Schumacher raced into a lead few thought he would lose. But after the last round of pitstops, the Ferrari's tires were not working as well and Villeneuve closed in. Heading down the back straight, the French-Canadian dived up the inside into the following hairpin corner, surprising Schumacher, who turned into the corner and into the side of the Williams. Schumacher slid off into the gravel and retirement while Villeneuve, his car damaged from the collision, hobbled on to finish third and take the title by three points. A vilified Schumacher was later stripped of his second place in the championship for his desperate maneuver. 1998 (Japanese Grand Prix, Suzuka) MIKA HAKKINEN v Michael Schumacher . An intriguing season, the first with grooved tires and narrow-track cars, had seen Hakkinen surge into an early season lead with a lightning-quick, if somewhat fragile McLaren. But Schumacher's Ferrari benefited from Goodyear's incessant tire development and by mid-season the never-say-die German was back in the title hunt. Going to the season-closer in Japan, Schumacher had to make up four points on Hakkinen, who had edged the previous race at the Nurgburgring. Schumacher had claimed pole at Suzuka, just ahead of Hakkinen, but stalled on the grid, further adding to his reputation of fumbling pressure-cooker situations. Starting from the back at the restart, he sliced his way up to third and was keeping his fingers crossed for a problem for the race-leading Finn. But a puncture on lap 31 ended his title hopes. An ice-cool Hakkinen was not headed throughout and could coast to his first drivers' world championship. 2007 (Brazilian Grand Prix, Interlagos) KIMI RAIKKONEN v Lewis Hamilton v Fernando Alonso . It had been a remarkable debut season for McLaren's Hamilton, with him often outpacing double world champion team-mate Alonso. But after a slow start, Ferrari's Raikkonen had begun to look menacing as the season progressed. F1's first three-way title decider since 1986 saw Hamilton start the last race in Brazil with a four-point advantage over Alonso and seven over Raikkonen. Felipe Massa's Ferrari took pole with Hamilton alongside, but the Englishman was slow away and by turn three he was behind Raikkonen and Alonso. Rashly, Hamilton attempted to re-pass Alonso, ran wide and dropped down the order. Soon after, he suffered gearbox problems that cost him 30 seconds -- effectively scuppering his chances of becoming F1's first rookie champion. Out front, Massa slowed to allow Raikkonen past for the win he needed to become champion by one point from seventh-placed Hamilton and Alonso, who trailed home a distant third.", "6ccc90832425c1590001a0fa8ef77e42f5516b02": "(CNN) -- Strange things seem to happen when Grant Wilson enters a room. Grant Wilson, left, and partner Jason Hawes were driven by personal experiences to track ghosts. Human forms materialize in darkened hallways. The dead whisper greetings from beyond the grave. Unseen entities attack and hurl terrified people to the ground. Every day is Halloween for Wilson, co-star of the Sci Fi Channel's hit show, \"Ghost Hunters.\" Close encounters of the paranormal kind would drive most people to look for another hobby, but Wilson says he ain't afraid of no ghosts. \"That's part of the job,\" says Wilson, who investigates suspected hauntings with his co-host, Jason Hawes.. \"We tell everyone that we train that you'll be punched, slapped and grabbed. Be prepared for it.\" Anyone who has watched their 401(k) account evaporate during the recent stock market dive knows something about horror. But Wilson is part of a growing community that prefers getting their chills the old-fashioned way. They are ghost hunters, or, as they prefer to be called, paranormal investigators. \"Ghost-Hunters,\" which airs a special live show at 7 p.m. Halloween night, is helping lift the stigma once attached to paranormal investigators. The show has become so popular that the group featured in each episode -- The Atlantic Paranormal Society - has spawned imitators across the United States and affiliates in 12 countries. TAPS, as the \"Ghost Hunters\" group is informally known, even has its own \"Beyond Reality Radio\" show, magazine, lecture tours, T-shirts --and groupies. \"Ghost Hunters\" has made creepy cool, says David Schrader, a paranormal investigator and co-host of \"Darkness Radio,\" a radio show that investigates paranormal activity. \"Five or six years ago, you'd be embarrassed to sit around the water cooler talking about ghosts, but now everybody talks about it -- it's gone mainstream,\" Schrader says. It's also gone Hollywood. Paranormal shows like \"Paranormal State\" on A&E Television; \"Haunting Evidence\" on truTV (which, like CNN.com, is owned by Time Warner); \"Dead Famous\" on the Biography Channel; and \"A Haunting\" on the Discovery Channel are trying to mimic the success of \"Ghost Hunters.\" Paranormal investigators aren't just chasing ghosts anymore; they're chasing television gigs, Schrader says. \"Everybody I know has a pilot in development -- including me,\" Schrader says. \"They throw it around like Frisbees. It's become a joke.\" The paranormal shows have also created a paranormal circuit. Families and friends attend ghost-hunting conventions, retreats (one was dubbed \"GhoStock,\") swap tips on ghost-hunting gear and make pilgrimages to famous haunted places like The Stanley Hotel in Colorado, the setting for the Stephen King movie, \"The Shining.\"  I hear dead people. \u00bb . Why they chase ghosts . Many of these amateur paranormal investigators are inspired -- and freaked out - by what they see on \"Ghost Hunters.\" Some of the incidents recorded by \"Ghost Hunters\" are mystifying: Ghostly forms appear on camera, chairs lurch across rooms by themselves and voices of people long dead are played back to their wide-eyed relatives. In one of the most famous \"Ghost Hunters\" episodes, a cameraman is grabbed and hurled to the ground --though no one appears to touch him. The cameraman is so shaken that he sobs and quits the show. Wilson says people who think they have a ghost at home should not try a do-it-yourself home ghost repair. A person who uses Ouija boards or anything else to contact ghosts can unleash malevolent spirits. \"You might not be ready for what happens,\" Wilson says. Watch Grant's encounter with a ghost \u00bb . Some ghost-hunters say they entered the field because, like Wilson, they had personal experiences with the supernatural. Others want to know if there is something beyond death. Others like Marley Gibson, an author and paranormal investigator says they're more scared by current events. \"We're living in a world where we're fighting two wars, we've got poverty, homelessness, people not having health care and a job -- people want escapism,\" says Gibson, author of  \"Ghost Huntress: The Awakening\" a forthcoming book that follows the exploits of a 16-year-old girl who forms a paranormal research team. Ask ghost hunters if they get scared and many give the same reply -- I don't do scared, just startled. Gibson says many ghost-hunters go into investigations armed with strong spiritual beliefs. \"I've never met such spiritually-grounded, religious, God-fearing people as I have in the paranormal community,\" she says. 'I felt a ... very large finger or a paw poke me in the back' Sometimes paranormal investigators, though, admit they experience what Schrader, the Darkness Radio co-host calls, \"Oh [bleep]' moments.\" Schrader had one last December, when he apparently took his job home with him one evening. He visited his ex-wife and children after coming back from a ghost-hunting retreat and decided to spend the night in the basement. Around three in the morning, he says, he heard his then one-year-old daughter screaming. He ran upstairs to hear her say that a shadow was watching her in her room. He comforted his daughter and returned to sleep downstairs. His wife then called him an hour later on his cell phone from her bedroom and whispered: \"Get up in my room. There's something here and I can see it.\" Nothing was there but Schrader says some spirits had apparently thought it was OK to pay a visit to his family. He says people who are open to the existence of ghosts sometimes become \"beacons\" that attract spirits. Schrader decided to solve the problem by calling for a supernatural version of pest-control. He blessed the house with holy water and called in two \"demonologist\" to cleanse the house. No more ghosts. Patrick Burns, a paranormal investigator and co-host of \"Haunting Evidence,\" had one of his teeth-chattering moments when there was no one around to call. He says he was working on a documentary on ghosts from his home computer one night when he felt something touch him. \"I felt a very pronounced poke with a very large finger, or possibly a paw, just above my beltline on the back,\" he says. Now the average person might have taken that as a cue to run from the room. But Burns is a professional, and besides, he has his own paranormal television show. He shrugged and kept working. Then, he says, he felt the room temperature drop. Cold spots are often associated with hauntings, but Burns kept working because, as he said later: \"No way is my house is haunted.\" Finally, he heard a thud that sounded like a body slammed against the wall. The impact is so hard that it shook the house, he says. \"I throw off my headphones and say, 'Okay you have my attention now,' \"Burns says. \"After that, nothing else happened. It just wanted me to acknowledge that it was there.\" Sometimes encounters with the living can be just as strange as their encounters with the paranormal, ghost hunters say. Wilson, the  \"Ghost Hunters\" co-host, says he's more leery of people than ghosts. Paranormal investigators like him and Burns are now so famous that they have adoring fans. Wilson is a Roto-Rooter plumber by day, but he had to stop answering residential calls because too many people were breaking their toilets just to meet him Hawes, his ghost hunting/plumbing partner. Though Wilson says he's never been scared by a ghost, he still sounds shaken by one encounter. He says he once met an entity that displayed a personal interest in him. She appeared in front of him, displayed a tattoo of his face stenciled on her leg, and asked him what he thought. The \"entity\" was a fan Wilson met during a public appearance. \"That,\" Wilson admits, \"was a little scary.\"", "c24025591e20b5d21062d1a1ec8fbf4686b963b7": "(CNN) -- With a week to go before Election Day, most recent national polls show Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama with an advantage. But how much are they to be believed? As Election Day gets closer, will the race tighten in the polls? The most recent national CNN poll of polls showed Obama with an 8-point lead over Republican presidential nominee John McCain, 51 percent to 43 percent. The polls were conducted October 21 through October 26. Most other national polls show Obama with a lead ranging between 5 points and double digits. A look at CNN polling during the same period before Election Day in 2000 and 2004 suggests that political observers and campaign supporters ought to be cautious in declaring the race over because of current polling numbers. See the latest state and national polls . When a presidential race has a non-incumbent in the lead, like this year, the poll numbers tend to tighten as Election Day gets closer, CNN senior researcher Alan Silverleib said. \"Any time it looks like they are on the verge of voting somebody new into office, there is buyer's remorse,\" he said. \"Based on that, and the fact that the country has been so polarized in recent elections, there's pretty good reason to think that the polls might tighten up a little bit.\" Four years ago, a national CNN poll of polls released about a week before Election Day showed President Bush leading Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry by 3 points, 49 percent to 46 percent. The poll was released October 25 and reflected likely voters' choice for president. Election Day was November 2 in 2004. A national CNN poll of polls released November 1 showed Bush leading Kerry by 2 points, 48 percent to 46 percent. President Bush won by 3 percentage points, 51 percent to 48 percent. In 2000, it was a bit of a different story. Election Day arrived November 7 that year. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup tracking poll conducted October 29 through October 31 showed Bush, then the Texas governor, leading Democratic Sen. Al Gore, 48 percent to 43 percent. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. A subsequent poll conducted November 2 through November 4, released two days before the voters cast their ballots, showed the same results. Gore, however, ended up winning the popular vote by about 540,000 votes. When broken down by percentage, both candidates had about 48 percent of the popular vote. Bush won the Electoral College, and thereby the presidency, by 5 electoral votes. Two of the battleground states this year, as in many recent presidential elections, are Ohio and Florida. What did the polls say before Election Day in those states four years ago? In Florida, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll conducted about a week before Election Day showed Bush leading Kerry 51 percent to 43 percent. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points and was conducted October 21 through October 24. Kerry caught up to Bush in the polls before Election Day and led by a single point, 48 percent to 47 percent, in a similar poll conducted October 28 through October 31. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Bush won Florida by 5 percentage points in 2004. In Ohio four years ago, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll showed Kerry leading Bush by a point -- 49 percent to 48 percent -- about two weeks before Election Day. The poll was conducted October 17 through October 20 and had margin of error of plus or minus 4 points. A week before November 7, Election Day, a similar poll showed Kerry leading Bush 50 percent to 46 percent. The poll was conducted October 28 through October 31, and the margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. Bush won Ohio by 2 points in 2004, 51 percent to 49 percent. Obama leads McCain in recent CNN poll of polls conducted in both states. In Florida, he leads McCain 49 percent to 45 percent. The polls were conducted October 23 through October 26. In Ohio, Obama has an 8-point lead over McCain, 50 percent to 42 percent. The polls were conducted October 22 through October 27. 'Buyer's remorse' in recent history . There have been a few examples of such \"buyer's remorse\" in recent history, Silverleib said. \"We saw that with [Arkansas Gov. Bill] Clinton in 1992, when the polls suddenly tightened up during the last week,\" he said. \"It was almost like people saying, 'Do we really want this guy?' \" They did. Clinton soundly defeated President George H.W. Bush, 43 percent to 37 percent. In another example, polls tightened during the 1968 presidential race between Republican Richard Nixon and Democrat Hubert Humphrey. Nixon led by double digits among registered voters in late September, according to a Gallup analysis published Monday. The lead dwindled to 8 points in a poll conducted October 17 through October 22. By early November, Nixon was clinging to a 1-point lead. The poll was conducted October 29 through November 1 and surveyed likely voters, according to Gallup. Nixon won by less than 1 percentage point. \"Humphrey had all the momentum at the end, and there's an open question there that had that election gone on for another week, Humphrey might very well had won,\" Silverleib said. There is then the oft-cited example of Thomas Dewey and Harry Truman in 1948. Polls predicted that Dewey would win, but Truman pulled off the upset. Silverleib, however, is reluctant to cite that race as illustrative of the accuracy of contemporary polls. \"People talk about Dewey and Truman, but they stopped polling a couple of weeks before the election,\" he said, adding, \"polling then wasn't nearly as refined a science as it is now.\" However, in what might be a bit of sobering news for the McCain campaign, since 1956, front-runners in late October lost the popular vote only twice after being ahead in the Gallup poll a week before Election Day, according to that polling organization's analysis. Obama held a lead in both of Gallup's likely voter tracking polls released Tuesday.", "20fd8bd577028a57d12fa5097fbb5d93c8aaa795": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- As Washington gears up for January's presidential inauguration with high-priced tickets to fancy affairs, one businessman is making sure that some of the less fortunate will have a chance to share in the festivities. Earl Stafford is a Virginia businessman helping the disadvantaged see the inauguration. Virginia businessman Earl Stafford has spent $1 million to give hundreds of poverty-stricken and terminally ill Americans, along with wounded men and women in uniform, an inauguration experience that won't cost them anything. The zero-dollar price tag is even more shocking, considering that tickets to the inaugural events are going for hundreds of dollars, the city's remaining hotel rooms are edging into four-figure territory, and even basements and couches miles from the National Mall are going for a premium on Craigslist. Tickets for the inauguration are distributed through members of Congress, and just 240,000 seats are available for the swearing-in ceremony. The tickets are supposed to be free, but with demand outpacing supply, some people have been trying to scalp tickets for thousands of dollars. Stafford's event is one of the splashiest inauguration packages out there. It includes high-end hotel rooms and luxury suites, food and drinks, a heated viewing spot right above the parade route, even gowns and tuxedos to wear to celebratory balls and a beautician to help attendees get ready. Hours after the election, Stafford, a 60-year-old businessman and son of a Baptist minister, invested in what the JW Marriott billed as its $1 million \"build-your-own-ball\" inaugural hotel package. His family's nonprofit foundation, the Stafford Foundation, is footing the bill for what it is calling the People's Inaugural Project, but it is also hoping to get money from sponsors. Stafford said Thursday that he hopes the balcony terrace is filled \"with those who are disadvantaged, those who are distressed, mingling with those who aren't so. And we hope to see on their faces a sense of excitement.\" \"I was inspired to do this by the Lord. ... It's not about us but about us helping other people,\" he said. At least third of the tickets to the event will go toward people who are needy or underprivileged, and the rest of those participating could be people from sponsoring foundations, companies or volunteers. Everything, he said, will be taken care of: transportation, evening gowns and tuxedos for the ball. He hopes that providing a front row seat to history will inspire those invited to do good things in their communities. Stafford said he began thinking about the project in March. He voted for Barack Obama, and records show he contributed $4,600 to the Democrat's campaign, according to the Washington Post. Stafford, a retired Air Force officer, noted that he does not agree with all of Obama's positions. But, he told the paper, he decided the inauguration would be \"a transition in history, if you will ... and everyone should be included.\" CNN's Samantha Hayes and Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this report.", "73f1d1dbc4c54661b4a96c3bcb9e1683ed27bae3": "(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania man has been sentenced to 45 years in prison in a deadly bank robbery plot -- described by the judge in the case as \"incredibly bizarre\" -- in which a pizza deliveryman died when a bomb affixed to his neck exploded. This device held a bomb to the neck of Brian Wells during a 2003 bank robbery in Erie, Pennsylvania. At the sentencing in Erie, Pennsylvania, prosecutors repeated their contention that the pizza deliveryman was involved in planning the robbery attempt but wore a live bomb only after being threatened by his co-conspirators. Kenneth Barnes, 55, of Erie, was sentenced Wednesday after he pleaded guilty in September to conspiracy to commit bank robbery and using a destructive device during a crime of violence. Prosecutors said Barnes and three co-conspirators -- one of whom was pizza deliveryman Brian Wells -- planned to rob a PNC Bank on the outskirts of Erie, and Wells, 46, carried out the robbery on August 28, 2003. Authorities said Wells walked into the bank with a pipe bomb locked to his neck and passed a note demanding money to a teller. The robbery netted about $8,700. Wells died when the bomb exploded as he sat in a parking lot after being stopped by police shortly after the robbery. The case drew national attention and was the subject of intense investigation and questions about whether Wells was a willing participant or a murder victim. Prosecutors said after Barnes' sentencing that Wells was involved in planning the robbery but balked when he realized that the bomb he was supposed to wear was real. He was threatened with a gun to make him wear the bomb, according to prosecutors. U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan called the sentence \"appropriate and just,\" and said the contentions of Wells' family that he was not involved in the plot are \"overwhelmingly\" countered by evidence of meetings with Wells, Barnes and the other two co-conspirators before the robbery. One of the alleged co-conspirators is now dead and the other one, Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong, is undergoing treatment at a federal facility in Texas after the judge in the case found her mentally incompetent to stand trial. Her case will be re-examined by the court next year, said Margaret Philbin, spokeswoman for Buchanan's office. In sentencing Barnes, U.S. District Judge Sean J. McLaughlin said, \"To me, the callousness and complete lack of regard for human life is, in a word, chilling. This case represents the unhappy combination of incredibly bizarre and sadly tragic.\"", "3b2e95a96f67dc8311d1cf8f03165e85cb51b5ea": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Libya has paid $1.5 billion to the families of terrorism victims, overcoming the final obstacle to full relations with the United States, the State Department said Friday. Police officers survey the wreckage of Pan Am Flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988. The payment ends Tripoli's legal liability in U.S. terror cases and paves the way for increased U.S. involvement in the oil-rich nation. President Bush signed an executive order Friday restoring Libyan immunity from terrorism-related lawsuits and dismissing pending cases over compensation as part of a deal reached this summer. David Welch, the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, who negotiated the agreement, called Libya's rehabilitation from a terrorist nation to a U.S. ally \"historic.\" The pact closes the book on a contentious period in U.S.-Libyan relations, which began in the 1980s with a series of attacks involving the two countries, including the bombings of Pan Am flight 103, a German disco and U.S. airstrikes over Libya. U.S. business executives hope the new relationship will lead to billions of dollars of new investment in Libya, a country rich in petroleum reserves but lacking a developed infrastructure. This summer, the United States and Libya signed a deal for the State Department to create a $1.8 billion compensation fund to finalize the claims for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the 1986 bombing of La Belle disco in Berlin, Germany. It also compensates Libyan victims of U.S. airstrikes in the 1980s. Congress unanimously adopted the Libyan Claims Resolution Act, sponsored by Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, which cleared the way to end the feud and created the victim compensation fund. Under the agreement, Libya pays more than $500 million to settle remaining claims from the Lockerbie case and more than $280 million for victims of the disco bombing. It will also set aside funds to compensate victims of several other incidents blamed on Libya, although Libya has not accepted responsibility. In exchange, Libya will now be exempt from legislation passed this year enabling terrorism victims to be compensated using frozen assets of governments blamed for attacks. Tripoli sought the protection to encourage U.S. companies to invest in Libya without fear of being sued by terrorism victims or their families. An initial payment of $300 million was received this month, after the opening of a U.S. trade office in Libya and a historic visit by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Another $600 million was received Thursday and the remaining $600 million Friday, Welch said, adding that the families could start receiving payments within days. The remaining $300 million will go to Libyan victims of the bombing in Libya by U.S. warplanes in 1986. Libyans say dozens of people died in the U.S. air attack, including an adopted daughter of Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. President Reagan ordered the attacks on Tripoli and Benghazi after two U.S. soldiers were killed and 79 Americans were injured in the 1986 Berlin disco bombing. The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 killed 270 people, including 189 Americans. Of the dead, 259 people died on board the plane and another 11 on the ground. Libya has paid 268 families involved in the Pan Am bombing $8 million each of a $10 million settlement. But it withheld the remaining $2 million owed to each family over a dispute regarding U.S. obligations to Tripoli. A group of relatives of Pan Am victims said in a statement Friday that they applauded Libya's fulfillment of the agreement. \"The Pan Am 103 families deeply appreciate Sen. Lautenberg's work to urge the administration to take every step to bring the agreement to fruition,\" spokeswoman Kara Weipz said in the statement. \"While our loved ones will never be forgotten, we are glad this chapter in our efforts is finally over.\" Ties between the two countries began to improve in 2003, when Libya gave up its weapons of mass destruction program and began compensating Lockerbie victims. But lingering lawsuits prevented the two countries from fully normalizing ties. The State Department has said the deal was pursued on a \"purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party.\" Senior State Department officials said the formula was designed to respect Libyan sensitivities about compensating victims for incidents for which it hasn't taken responsibility and also allow Libya to settle outstanding claims for the air strikes on Tripoli. Donations to settle Libyan claims were placed in the \"voluntary\" fund, from which each country involved in the claims draws the money to pay its citizens. Welch would not say exactly where the money came from but stressed that no American taxpayer money would be used to compensate Libya. The deal is to be followed by an upgrading of U.S. relations with Libya, including the confirmation of a U.S. ambassador, which was held up until the payments were made. Lautenberg applauded the payment Friday. \"American victims and their families have waited decades for Libya to pay for its deadly acts of violence and today they have received long-overdue justice,\" he said in a statement. \"I am pleased that our relentless pressure and support for terror victims has led to this historic moment.\" Rice's visit in September, the first by a secretary of state since 1953, was hailed by both countries as a breakthrough. It followed months of negotiations between the two countries.", "f83e0b40b3e4430ff0f19fbff380e6fcedf879fd": "(CNN) -- Douglas Cootey is replacing his lightbulbs with brighter ones, but not just to see better. The new broad spectrum lights simulate sunlight, and might help enliven his mood in the gloomy winter months. A light box like the one shown here may help some people combat seasonal depression in winter. Cootey, a stay-at-home dad in Salt Lake City, Utah, has struggled with depression for 16 years and shares his story with others on his blog, The Splintered Mind. He said he started to notice last year that his depression was harder to manage in the winter. His challenge, he told CNN, is \"keeping a positive and upbeat attitude in the face of a chemical onslaught induced by winter.\" He realized that his symptoms fit those of seasonal affective disorder, a condition that typically generates depression during autumn and winter and then goes away in the sunnier months. In rarer cases, people can suffer from it only in summer. \"I set the clock back and look at this: I've been so unproductive,\" Cootey said. \"Now that I know what's going on, I'm trying to counteract it.' Between 4 and 6 percent of the U.S. population suffers from seasonal affective disorder, according to the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, but 10 to 20 percent of the population may suffer from more mild winter doldrums. SAD is more common in women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, the Cleveland Clinic says. Some people may be genetically predisposed to SAD, but  the environment can trigger it as well, said Ignacio Provencio, a biology professor at the University of Virginia.  Learn about other mood disorders \u00bb . A recent study led by Provencio shows that a genetic mutation in the eye could play a role in seasonal affective disorder. The mutation makes a person with SAD less sensitive to light. The photopigment gene is called melanopsin, which helps detect colors. \"Being able to look at one's DNA and seeing that you're a carrier or contain two copies of this gene may be able to, in the future, allow one to predict whether or not they will be susceptible to this disease,\" Provencio said. The information may also help predict which people with seasonal affective disorder will respond to light therapy, because the mutated genes involve light sensitivity, he said. Light therapy works for some people, experts say, by mimicking outdoor light and promoting a biochemical change in the brain that improves mood. The researchers looked at 220 people, including 90 nondepressed people and 130 people diagnosed with the disorder. In this group, seven people with seasonal affective disorder had two mutated copies of the gene. The study results make sense to Dr. David Baron, chairman of Temple University's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science in Philadelphia. The study is \"consistent with the literature on understanding genetics in vulnerability to illness,\" he said. But Stephen Josephson, associate professor at Cornell University Medical Center-New York Hospital and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, said the study points to a correlation but does not constitute definitive proof. Although the specific causes of the disorder aren't known, some biological factors might contribute to it. Circadian rhythm, which helps regulate the body's internal clock, may be disrupted with the drop in sunlight in fall and winter, MayoClinic.com says. Other research indicates that the brain chemical serotonin and the sleep-related hormone melatonin may play a role, MayoClinic.com says. Although seasonal affective disorder symptoms typically kick in around late autumn or early winter, some people experience \"summer depression,\" accompanied by symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, irritability, agitation, and poor appetite, according to MayoClinic.com. Experts say seasonal affective disorder is more prevalent in places farther from the equator. Someone who has a genetic predisposition to SAD may not have problems if he or she lives in Singapore, for example, Baron said. Some people with seasonal affective disorder use a light box, a device that shines a bright light similar to outdoor light, which a patient sits in front of for a half hour or hour a day, Josephson said. Experts say consult a doctor if you feel you may have seasonal affective disorder. Certain cases require antidepressants or other medications, but some people manage it through light therapy or psychotherapy. For winter depression, MayoClinic.com also recommends exercising regularly and, if possible, taking vacations to warmer, sunnier places. Cootey said this winter he will try to learn how to ski and ice skate. He recommends finding a support community, such as an online forum or his blog, The Splintered Mind. He also finds relying on humor keeps spirits up. He has relied on cognitive behavioral therapy to manage depression for 16 years. With a therapist, he   tries to identify what triggers the disorder or other problems. \"Change your thinking, change your life. Mind over mood. These are the mantras that keep me in control of my depression and will help me overcome, or at least manage SAD,\" he said.", "a1331e7c8a3daa637e0dfb026b0ff8551e491d69": "(CNN) -- Americans and other foreigners were among those caught up in the bloodshed and chaos of the terror attacks in Mumbai, India, on Wednesday and Thursday. A foreign national held hostage by gunmen for nearly 24 hours is released from the Oberoi hotel in Mumbai. At least six foreigners were among the 125 dead, police said.  Targets included two luxury hotels, the Oberoi and the Taj Mahal, as well as a cafe popular with Western tourists. A man told a local television station that he was in the Oberoi around 10 p.m. Wednesday when gunmen entered the lobby and began rounding up guests, asking for anyone with a U.S. or British passport and taking about 15 of them hostage. Fire raged at the Oberoi, the scene of much bloodshed as explosions and gunshots rang out Thursday morning. Outside the Taj Mahal, screaming and fighting broke out as reporters scrambled to capture the chaotic scene. Australian filmmaker Anthony Rose told CNN that he had just arrived at the Oberoi hotel when he heard gunshots in the lobby and saw a fellow Australian shot in the leg and then shot at close range in the head by one of the attackers. He said that he and others in his film crew fled through back doors in the hotel to escape the shooters. Among those killed in the two days of violence was British yachtsman Andreas Liveras, according to St. George's Hospital in Mumbai. At least one French national is trapped in the Oberoi hotel, according to the French Foreign Ministry in Paris. A woman from Nashville, Tennessee, was shot in the arm and leg by the attackers, who barged into a ballroom at her hotel, her husband told CNN affiliate WSMV. Andi Varagona operates a holistic health clinic in Nashville and was in Mumbai for training, her husband, Santos Lopez, told the station. According to Lopez, his wife called him and said, \"We were ambushed and we were shot.\" When he asked Varagona if she was all right, she told him she had been shot in the leg and arm and was at that moment being wheeled into surgery, Lopez said. \"My God, I cried more than I cried in my entire life,\" Lopez told WSMV. \"I mean, it's just been so overwhelming with emotion. ... You tend to believe that things that happen in the world happen to other people, until it happens to you.\"  Watch hostages walk from the building looking dazed \u00bb . WSMV is reporting that Varagona came out of surgery Wednesday night -- a bullet removed from her leg. An American woman, who was still inside the Taj with her husband, told CNN by phone Thursday that television feeds into the rooms had stopped and she did not know what was going on. \"We have water and we're hunkered down and patient and ready to wait it out,\" she said. \"We're OK. Last night was a different story, but today we're OK.\" The woman, whom CNN is not identifying so as not to disclose her location to the gunmen, said she heard gunfire outside her room Wednesday night and \"a man with an American accent screaming for help.\" Aparna Dash, an American who lives in Pennsylvania but is visiting Mumbai on business, was staying at the Oberoi hotel. She was on the phone with her husband, who was in the United States, when the first explosions rang out. \"She thought it was firecrackers and didn't think much of it,\" her husband, Biswa Dash, told CNN. \"But then in the coming hours, she realized what was going on and all the people in the hotel began trying to get out, to rush down the stairs.\" Aparna Dash had made it down to the fifth floor from her room on the 26th floor, her husband said, and found an American woman sitting on the stairs, dazed and crying. iReport.com: Are you there? Share your story and send photos and video . \"They were telling [the woman] that she needed to get up and keep moving,\" said Biswa Dash, recounting what his wife told him. \"She was crying and saying that there were all these people piled on top of each other and that the armed men had come at them just straight on -- without masks, without trying to hide their faces at all. Just charging at them with their ammunition and their AK-47s.\" Indian Prime Minister Moanmohan Singh said the attackers were likely foreigners, but he did not name a country where he believed they were from. Officially, the Indian authorities are saying no one has claimed responsibility. A group called the Deccan Mujahideen took credit in e-mails sent to several Indian news outlets. Authorities found 8 kilograms (17 pounds) of RDX, one of the most powerful military explosives, at a restaurant near the Taj, indicating that the attackers may have been planning more violence. A woman whom CNN is only identifying by her first name -- Andrea -- spoke to CNN from Mumbai, where she is visiting for her brother's wedding. She is staying at a hotel a few blocks from the Taj. She heard the explosions Wednesday and then immediately got a call from her brother, who lives in Hong Kong. He was worried, saying that he had heard reports of gunfire. \"And we were like, 'Yeah, gunshots, we're from New Orleans, whatever,' \" Andrea said. A few hours later, she said, her brother called back and said, \"This is a big deal, put on the TV.\" \"That's when we figured out what was going on,\" Andrea said. \"Over the course of the night we heard maybe three explosions, some emergency vehicles, sirens. For the most part the street was really quiet,\" she said. \"We've been watching the news the whole time, just like everyone else.\" She needed water, so she left her hotel and a person at a restaurant helped her, she said. She has since been in contact with the U.S. embassy and the family is moving the wedding.", "ff6ce6b88b20829714c9c980b948f8909f46d393": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- French speed sailing trimaran,l'Hydroptere has broken yet another world record as its crew draw closer to two major milestones.

People use a boat to navigate flooded streets in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina last week. The number of missing residents has increased to 31, the agency said. The previous tally was 19. Nearly 79,000 residents have been left homeless, many of them in the hard-hit state of Santa Catarina. Many of the deaths have been caused by mudslides. Officials are now worried about disease, as 10 cases of leptospirosis are suspected, the state news agency reported. Leptospirosis is an infection in rodents and other wild and domesticated animals, according to the World Health Organization. In humans, exposure through water contaminated by urine from infected animals is the most common form of infection. The disease is often found in flooded areas. Ten people with symptoms are being treated in the cities of Blumenau and Ilhota, the state-run Agencia Brasil reported. Symptoms usually occur 2 to 30 days after infection and consist of high fever, malaise, sharp and constant headache, intense muscular pain, fatigue and chills. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea also are common. About 10 percent of patients develop jaundiced eyes after the third day, indicating the most severe cases. Authorities also were warning residents in flooded areas to be careful with food and water they consume. Food that has been under water or moist should not be eaten unless it's in a sealed plastic bag or a can, officials said. The health secretary for Santa Catarina said residents who drink contaminated water also run the risk of getting hepatitis A and diarrhea. Rescuers also are at risk of disease and injury. In the city of Maximus in Luis Alves state, eight rescuers were injured over the weekend, one of them gravely, Agencia Brasil reported. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Monday that Santa Catarina will be rebuilt and become just as strong as it was. \"We cannot lose hope,\" Lula said. \"We must be convinced that people will reconstruct the state of Santa Catarina. There is a national solidarity never seen before in the history of the country.\" Lula flew over some of the flooded areas last week and proclaimed the disaster one of the worst in the country's history. \"I've never seen anything like this,\" he said Thursday. He said last week he was releasing 1.97 billion Reals (more than US$850 million) in aid to the afflicted areas. Officials have distributed 880 tons of food, nearly 1 million liters of water and 60 tons of clothing, toys and cleaning and personal hygiene material, Agencia Brasil said Monday. The Civil Defense said seaplanes have flown 548 relief missions in seven days. The disaster also is having an economic effect, with bridges, roads, houses and buildings destroyed. The Federation of Industries said the closed port in Itajai is costing $33 million a day. The port is the major terminal for frozen goods in Brazil and second in the transport of containers, Agencia Brasil said. Port Superintendent Arnaldo Schmitt said last week part of the terminal could be back in operation in two weeks. Weather conditions may not allow that to happen, though.

Mexico City, Mexico, has a well-deserved reputation for heavy traffic. Now car thefts may be added to the list. That's no surprise to Guillermo Cruz, who has bought two new cars this year: the first after his original car was stolen, and the second three months later after two armed men pointed guns at him, got in and drove off with Cruz inside. \"They dropped me off in the street and I thought they had already left, and I went back\" to where they had taken it, he said. \"And still they hadn't left; they were inside the car. And one man said to the other, 'Let's shoot him because he's becoming annoying.' \" According to the Mexican Association of Insurance Institutions, the capital of Mexico City is a favorite site for car thieves to work. \"If we talk about data from the federal district, we can say that we have 16,000 automobiles stolen, an increase of 10 percent from October 2007 to September 2008,\" said Recaredo Arias, a spokesman for the association. He said drug traffickers have contributed to the increase by pushing other bands of criminals into new lines of business. \"Perhaps they are taking up so much space from the point of view of the sources of income as from the point of view of supply and distribution of drugs to these bands and, as a result, the bands are looking for other types of crimes,\" he speculated.

She delivered this commentary during the \"Cutting through the Bull\" segment of Tuesday night's broadcast. CNN's Campbell Brown says \"having no life\" isn't a requirement for a man to get a job. (CNN) -- How many times have politicians been warned about the dangers of an open microphone? And yet, on Tuesday, the lectern mic at the National Governors Conference picked up this little nugget from Pennsylvania's Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell. He's having a conversation near the lectern about President-elect Barack Obama's choice for to lead the Homeland Security Department, Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano. Here is what Rendell said about Napolitano: . Rendell: Janet's perfect for that job. Because for that job, you have to have no life. Janet has no family. Perfect. She can devote, literally, 19-20 hours a day to it . Wow. Now, I'm sure Gov. Napolitano has many qualifications for the job beyond having no family, and therefore the ability to devote 20 hours a day to the job.  Watch Campbell Brown's commentary \u00bb . But it is fascinating to me that that is the quality being highlighted here as so perfect. C'mon. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff is married with two grown children. His predecessor, Tom Ridge, had a family. Anybody remember a debate about whether they would have trouble balancing the demands of work and family? Now, I am a fan of Gov. Rendell. He has been on this show many times. I like him for his candor. In our attempts to cut through the bull, he delivers far less bull than most politicians. But it is his frankness here that raises so many questions. 1. If a man had been Obama's choice for the job, would having a family or not having a family ever even have been an issue? Would it have ever prompted a comment? Probably not. We all know the assumption tends to be that with a man, there is almost always a wife in the wings managing those family concerns. 2. As a woman, hearing this, it is hard not to wonder if we are counted out for certain jobs, certain opportunities, because we do have a family or because we are in our child-bearing years. Are we? It is a fair question. 3. If you are a childless, single woman with suspicions that you get stuck working holidays, weekends and the more burdensome shifts more often than your colleagues with families, are those suspicions well-founded? Probably so. Is there an assumption that if you're family-free then you have no life? By some, yes. Again Gov. Rendell, I don't mean to rake you over the coals. I know what you meant to say. But your comments do perpetuate stereotypes that put us in boxes, both mothers and single women. In government and beyond, men have been given the benefit of the doubt when it comes to striking the right work-life balance. Women are owed the same consideration. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown.", "d9a0c37c3c87e36ed07629a332b2f35da173bbe4": "(Mental Floss) -- It's hard to walk down the aisle of a liquor store without running across a bottle bearing someone's name. A costumed reveler at a Captain Morgan party celebrates the rum named after the 17th century privateer. We put them in our cocktails, but how well do we know them? Here's some biographical detail on the men behind your favorite tipples: . 1. Captain Morgan . The Captain wasn't always just the choice of sorority girls looking to blend spiced rum with Diet Coke; in the 17th century he was a feared privateer. Not only did the Welsh pirate marry his own cousin, he ran risky missions for the governor of Jamaica, including capturing some Spanish prisoners in Cuba and sacking Port-au-Prince in Haiti. He then plundered the Cuban coast before holding for ransom the entire city of Portobelo, Panama. He later looted and burned Panama City, but his pillaging career came to an end when Spain and England signed a peace treaty in 1671. Instead of getting in trouble for his high-seas antics, Morgan received knighthood and became the lieutenant governor of Jamaica. Mental Floss: 5 drinking stories that put yours to shame . 2. Johnnie Walker . Walker, the name behind the world's most popular brand of Scotch whisky, was born in 1805 in Ayrshire, Scotland. When his father died in 1819, Johnnie inherited a trust of a little over 400 pounds, which the trustees invested in a grocery store. Walker became a very successful grocer in the town of Kilmarnock and even sold a whisky, Walker's Kilmarnock Whisky. Johnnie's son Alexander was the one who actually turned the family into famous whisky men, though. Alexander had spent time in Glasgow learning how to blend teas, but he eventually returned to Kilmarnock to take over the grocery from his father. Alexander turned his blending expertise to whisky, and came up with \"Old Highland Whisky,\" which later became Johnnie Walker Black Label. 3. Jack Daniel . Jasper Newton \"Jack\" Daniel of Tennessee whiskey fame was the descendant of Welsh settlers who came to the United States in the early 19th century. He was born in 1846 or 1850 and was one of 13 children. By 1866 he was distilling whiskey in Lynchburg, Tennessee. Unfortunately for the distiller, he had a bit of a temper. One morning in 1911 Daniel showed up for work early and couldn't get his safe open. He flew off the handle and kicked the offending strongbox. The kick was so ferocious that Daniel injured his toe, which then became infected. The infection soon became the blood poisoning that killed the whiskey mogul. Curious about why your bottle of J.D. also has Lem Motlow listed as the distillery's proprietor? Daniel's own busy life of distilling and safe-kicking kept him from ever finding a wife and siring an heir, so in 1907 he gave the distillery to his beloved nephew Lem Motlow, who had come to work for him as a bookkeeper. Mental Floss: The many myths of Jack Daniel . 4. Jose Cuervo . In 1758, Jose Antonio de Cuervo received a land grant from the King of Spain to start an agave farm in the Jalisco region of Mexico. Jose used his agave plants to make mescal, a popular Mexican liquor. In 1795, King Carlos IV gave the land grant to Cuervo's descendant Jose Maria Guadalupe de Cuervo. Carlos IV also granted the Cuervo family the first license to commercially make tequila, so they built a larger factory on the existing land. The family started packaging their wares in individual bottles in 1880, and in 1900 the booze started going by the brand name Jose Cuervo. The brand is still under the leadership of the original Jose Cuervo's family; current boss Juan-Domingo Beckmann is the sixth generation of Cuervo ancestors to run the company. 5. Jim Beam . Jim Beam, the namesake of the world's best-selling bourbon whiskey, didn't actually start the distillery that now bears his name. His great-grandfather Jacob Beam opened the distillery in 1788 and started selling his first barrels of whiskey in 1795. In those days, the whiskey went by the less-catchy moniker of \"Old Tub.\" Jacob Beam handed down the distillery to his son David Beam, who in turn passed it along to his son David M. Beam, who eventually handed the operation off to his son, Colonel James Beauregard Beam, in 1894. Although he was only 30 years old when he took over the family business, Jim Beam ran the distillery until Prohibition shut him down. Following repeal in 1933, Jim quickly built a distillery and began resurrecting the Old Tub brand, but he also added something new to the company's portfolio: a bourbon simply called Jim Beam. Mental Floss: A bourbon FAQ . 6. Tanqueray . When he was a young boy, Charles Tanqueray's path through life seemed pretty clear. He was the product of three straight generations of Bedfordshire clergymen, so it must have seemed natural to assume that he would take up the cloth himself. Wrong. Instead, he started distilling gin in 1830 in a little plant in London's Bloomsbury district. By 1847, he was shipping his gin to colonies around the British Empire, where many plantation owners and troops had developed a taste for Tanqueray and tonic. 7. Campari . Gaspare Campari found his calling quickly. By the time he was 14, he had risen to become a master drink mixer in Turin, Italy, and in this capacity he started dabbling with a recipe for an aperitif. When he eventually settled on the perfect mixture, his concoction had over 60 ingredients. In 1860, he founded Gruppo Campari to make his trademark bitters in Milan. Like Colonel Sanders' spice blend, the recipe for Campari is a closely guarded secret supposedly known by only the acting Gruppo Campari chairman, who works with a tiny group of employees to make the concentrate with which alcohol and water are infused to get Campari. The drink is still made from Gaspare Campari's recipe, though, which includes quinine, orange peel, rhubarb, and countless other flavorings. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

New York Giants receiver Plaxico Burress arrives at the 17th police precinct in Manhattan on Monday. The spokeswoman, Kathy Robinson, gave no further detail on the New York Presbyterian Hospital employee. \"We can confirm that the individual at New York Presbyterian Hospital, who was responsible for failing to report the incident, has been suspended,\" hospital spokeswoman Robinson said. Burress has garnered media attention recently for accidentally shooting himself with a gun he is accused of bringing into a crowded New York night club. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg slammed Burress on Monday, saying it would be an \"outrage\" if the Giants receiver isn't prosecuted \"to the fullest extent of the law\" after the shooting with a gun that authorities say he owned illegally. Burress, 31, was arraigned Monday on two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. He could face up to 15 years in prison, the Manhattan district attorney's office said. Alicia Maxey Greene, spokeswoman for the district attorney, said Burress is not expected to enter a plea until a court appearance in March. Burress' attorney, Benjamin Brafman, said he expects Burress to plead not guilty. Bloomberg, speaking at a news conference, made clear he wants Burress to face jail time. Noting a law that automatically sentences an offender to at least 3 1/2 years for illegally carrying a loaded handgun, Bloomberg said, \"It's pretty hard to argue the guy didn't have a gun and it wasn't loaded. You've got bullet holes in and out to show that it was there.\" The mayor also lashed out at New York Presbyterian Hospital for failing to inform police about the incident. He called on the state attorney general to \"go after\" the hospital for a \"chargeable offense.\" The district attorney's office said the hospital is under investigation. The hospital said it also is investigating the incident and promised to cooperate with authorities. In the incident Friday night, Burress suffered a wound to his right thigh and was treated and released from the hospital, the Giants said in a statement released over the weekend. Sports Illustrated reported that Burress had accidentally shot himself with a gun he was carrying while at Latin Quarter, a sprawling nightclub in Manhattan. Brafman said his client \"understands the seriousness of the situation, and he's addressing it in a responsible fashion.\" Brafman also said Burress is \"physically OK and mentally OK.\" He added that he does not know when Burress may be back on the field. Bloomberg, who has long fought against illegal gun ownership, said public figures \"make their living because of their visibility. They are the role models for our kids, and if we don't prosecute them, to the fullest extent of the law, I don't know who on Earth we would. It makes a sham, a mockery of the law.\" Turning his ire to New York Presbyterian Hospital, which treated Burress, Bloomberg said officials \"didn't do what they're legally required to do\" -- inform the authorities of the incident. \"It's a misdemeanor. It's a chargeable offense, and I think that the district attorney should certainly go after the management of this hospital.\" He also called on the hospital to fire those whose responsibility it was to alert the authorities. And Bloomberg added, \"I would question why the management didn't have training in place and didn't discipline them immediately. It's just an outrage.\" The hospital later Monday afternoon issued a statement acknowledging that \"not reporting a gunshot wound is a clear violation of our policies and procedures.\" \"We take this very seriously, and are conducting a thorough investigation into why this gunshot wound was not reported to the police department in a timely fashion. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken. We are in full cooperation with the mayor's office and the police department,\" it said. Bloomberg also complained that the Giants \"should have picked up the phone right away as good corporate citizens. I don't care whether there's a legal responsibility for them to do it. They are a team that is here in this region. I know they're in New Jersey, but it's the New York Giants, and they have a responsibility as a team that depends on the public and wants to be role models to the public.\" The mayor said police learned about the incident from a TV report. But team spokeswoman Pat Hanlon, in an e-mail to CNN, wrote, \"We are working closely with the police and NFL security. In the early hours of Saturday morning, as we started to get a sense of what we were dealing with, we did, in fact, notify NFL security, which then contacted the police.\" Over the weekend, the Giants issued a statement saying they were \"in contact with Plaxico since shortly after the incident,\" and that their primary concern was for his health and well-being. The team said it had contacted NFL security and was working to gather more details. The shooting was the latest bump in a rocky season for Burress, who became a hero of last season's Super Bowl when he caught the game-winning touchdown pass from quarterback Eli Manning with 35 seconds remaining. He was fined and suspended from the team's October 5 game for reportedly missing a practice without notifying the team. Later, he was fined $45,000 by the NFL after an October 19 game during which he argued with a referee and threw a football into the stands. He injured a hamstring in a game two weeks ago and was not scheduled to play in the Giants' game on Sunday.

Former Cuban President Fidel Castro has largely been out of the political scene since falling ill in 2006. \"With Obama, one can talk whenever he wants, because we're not preachers of violence or war,\" the communist leader wrote in an essay published Thursday on a state-run Web site. \"He must be reminded that the carrot-and-stick theory cannot be applied in our country.\" Friday's missive marked the second time in recent weeks that a Cuban leader has said he is open to meeting with Obama. In the latest issue of The Nation, actor Sean Penn writes of his recent conversation in Havana with Ra\u00fal Castro, who took over as president this year from his ailing brother. According to Penn, Ra\u00fal Castro told him, \"Perhaps we could meet at Guantanamo. We must meet and begin to solve our problems, and at the end of the meeting, we could give the president a gift. ... We could send him home with the American flag that waves over Guantanamo Bay.\" Obama has called for the U.S. detention facility at the Guantanamo Bay naval base on the island of Cuba to be closed. Despite the indications that the Cuban leadership is open to warmer relations with its neighbor to the north after 47 years of a U.S.-imposed trade embargo, some in Havana expressed skepticism that the impending change in leadership in the United States will translate in to a changed Cuban policy. \"Obama is a product of the American empire,\" Carlos Pose said.

But she knows how thankful she is to be at a church in Atlanta this November, lining up for turkey, stuffing and pecan pie. Sajida Faraj took a break to enjoy a Thanksgiving meal with fellow refugees. Three years ago she grabbed her son, now 12, and fled Iraq. Her husband, a carpenter who worked for Americans, had left for the market one day in Baghdad and never returned. Faraj says she knows he is dead, even though she has never seen his body. When the rest of her family started to receive death threats, she felt she had no choice but to run. Faraj and her son, Ahmed, made it across the border to Syria and later entered the United States, two of more than 15,000 Iraqi refugees to be allowed in since the beginning of the war in 2003. The Thanksgiving meal, served at the Avondale Pattillo United Methodist Church to dozens of refugees from far-flung places like Myanmar and Sudan as well as Iraq, is a welcome break for Faraj, who is struggling to build a new life. Unable to translate her skills as a Baghdad salon owner into a job as a stylist, Faraj does not have the money to pay $625 due in rent. \"I have an electricity bill to pay, I have no job,\" she says. \"I have no way of knowing what to do.\" Government and aid group assistance to refugees does not last long. Faraj plans to ask an aid group, the International Rescue Committee, for more help, but she's not sure what else she can do. Soon she hopes her 21-year-old daughter will arrive from Syria and bring with her better luck. \"My daughter is coming and hopefully I will work,\" she says, as Nepali dancers in elaborate costumes entertain the diners. Across the room, more and more refugees line up for the potluck dinner. \"Don't worry, there will be enough food,\" a man tells his two daughters, asking them to wait patiently. The man, Munir, and his wife, Fatima, hoped, like so many immigrants before them, that the United States would help them find a better life for them and their children. But the couple, who asked that their identities be protected for fear of reprisals against their family and friends still in Iraq, are considering ending their American dream after three months of struggle. College-educated and proficient in English, Fatima and Munir were shocked that the skills that provided them a comfortable living in Baghdad, as a mechanical engineer and lab technician, are of little advantage in an increasingly competitive U.S. job market. They spend much of their day at the IRC office in Atlanta, searching for employment, but are considering returning to Jordan, where they say they can find work, albeit illegally. \"I am worried that I will be thrown out on the street,\" Fatima says. \"My Pakistani neighbors couldn't find work and they were evicted and thrown out on the street. We are worried the same will happen to us. Many refugees we know have not found work and they have been here for eight months to a year.\" Until 2007, very few Iraqi refugees were resettled in the United States. For 2008, the Bush administration set a goal of accepting 13,000 Iraqis. Most of the estimated 2.2 million people who have fled Iraq since the invasion are in Syria and Jordan, many living illegally. Their presence is straining infrastructure and social services there and driving food and housing prices higher. Far from the warmth of the Thanksgiving party, another Iraqi refugee has managed to find work at a supermarket seafood counter, helping customers with their requests for jumbo shrimp and crab cakes. \"I am like a manager,\" says Muataz, with a glimmer of pride in his eye. \"I thank God that I have a job and that I am lucky.\" Muataz, who also asked that his identity be protected, was a college-educated artist and shop owner in Baghdad. He fled Iraq with his wife and three children after he was run off the road and shot in the side on his way home from work. A friend who was with him died in the assault. Muataz is now able to support his family with the aid of food stamps and hopes that his wife will find a job to help out financially. Nevertheless, he has been able to afford Internet service for his children and a car. That kind of American dream is all Faraj wants as she stands at a bus stop, bundled in her head scarf and winter coat, the music and laughter of the IRC Thanksgiving dinner now just a distant memory. She is on her way to the local farmers market, where she plans to spend the morning waiting in line with 40 or 50 other people hoping to work. Faraj says she has hope. \"I wish for my children to be like [the Americans],\" she says in Arabic. \"I wish they would have their own car, home, job -- to be American. \"I wish that because in my country, unfortunately, I did not see that. Not during Saddam's time or this new government. I wish I was still young. I would have left Iraq a long time ago.\"", "b1ed6635bc6d555265ae59ccd1272d30d700556d": "(CNN) -- Chevy Chase didn't look like Gerald Ford and didn't sound like Gerald Ford. But in the mid-1970s, when \"Saturday Night Live\" first went on the air, Chase -- then a writer and cast member of the show -- made his impression of the president, rife with pratfalls and slapstick, the talk of the country. He also made the president a butt of jokes, which was intentional, Chase told CNN in an interview. \"[Ford] was a sweet man, a terrific man -- [we] became good friends after, but ... he just tripped over things a lot,\" he said. \"It's not that I can imitate him so much that I can do a lot of physical comedy and I just made it, I just went after him. And ... obviously my leanings were Democratic and I wanted [Jimmy] Carter in and I wanted [Ford] out, and I figured look, we're reaching millions of people every weekend, why not do it.\" Over the years, \"Saturday Night Live's\" political satires have become a mainstay of the show, sometimes to startling effect.  Watch Chase talk about \"SNL's\" impact \u00bb . Al Franken -- now the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate from Minnesota -- and his then writing partner, Tom Davis, wrote a wicked takeoff of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book, \"The Final Days,\" which included Dan Aykroyd as a bitter Richard Nixon and John Belushi as a toadying Henry Kissinger. In the mid-'80s, a sketch starring Phil Hartman as Ronald Reagan showed the president, often lampooned as forgetful, with a razor-sharp command of the Iran-Contra situation, cutting deals in Arabic and barking orders at his staff. More recently, Dana Carvey's malaprop-laden impression of George H.W. Bush, Hartman's puppy-dog Bill Clinton, Will Ferrell's George W. Bush and Tina Fey's Sarah Palin have embedded themselves in the culture. Though Chase believes the show leans left, and Fey's Palin is an attempt to hurt the Republicans, Marc Liepis, NBC Universal senior director of late night publicity, had no comment. Certainly, \"SNL\" -- which began as one of the old '60s counterculture's first forays into network TV -- has also mocked Democrats. Indeed, sketches about the Democratic debates in the spring, one of which portrayed the media as fawning over Barack Obama, gave Hillary Clinton ammunition in her pursuit of the nomination. The writer of that sketch, Jim Downey, has been described as leaning conservative, though he was quoted in a March New York Times article as calling himself a registered Democrat. In the same article, \"SNL\" creator Lorne Michaels said, \"We don't lay down for anybody.\" Chase talked about his Ford impression and the political impact of \"Saturday Night Live\" with CNN's Alina Cho. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: Let's go back to '76. Chevy Chase:  It was Gerald Ford that was president but hadn't been elected and was running again and I just ... CNN: Some people say he was an accidental president and you made him accident prone. Chase: Actually, he was accident prone and he was a sweet man, a terrific man, became good friends later, and a relatively good athlete in college too ... but he just tripped over things a lot. ... You know, after a while, you just start writing the jokes and start doing it. So it's not that I can imitate him so much that I can do a lot of physical comedy, and I just made it, I just went after him. And I certainly, obviously my leanings were Democratic and I wanted Carter in and I wanted [Ford] out and I figured look, we're reaching millions of people every weekend, why not do it. CNN: You mean to tell me in the back of your mind you were thinking, hey I want Carter ... Chase: Oh, yeah. CNN: And I'm going to make him look bad. Chase: Oh yeah. What do you think they're doing now, you think they're just doing this because Sarah's funny? No, I think that the show is very much more Democratic and liberal-oriented, that they are obviously more for Barack Obama. [In the '70s], out of the Nixon era, and it was not unlikely that I might go that direction. CNN: I talked to one political pundit who said, I think Chevy Chase cost Ford the presidency. Chase: When you have that kind of a venue and power where you can reach so many millions of people and you've become a show that people watch, you know, you can affect a lot of people, and humor does it beautifully, because humor is perspective and has a way of making judgment calls. ... So I think there was no question that it had major effect and in fact, in speaking with his family and then later him, and even reading some of his books ... he felt so, too. CNN: What do you think of Tina Fey's portrayal of Sarah Palin? Chase: I think it's actually very spot on. ... I think, though, what Tina is saying is -- and she has also admitted it -- \"This woman is not a dumb woman, she's a smart woman, so am I, Tina Fey. Neither of us are smart enough to be the president, though.\" CNN: So having said that, what do you think then the impact is? You touched on your impact on Ford and his presidency ... Chase: I think more now then ever the impact is great because of how much larger the impact of the media is generally on people's lives, all sorts of media. ... I mean so there's so many outlets, but people just spend so much of their time in front of their computers and watching television in their computer. CNN: Is [\"SNL's\" politics] fair? Chase: Fair? What do you mean fair? They're an all-purpose comedy show. Of course it's fair, it's satire, it's what it is, and it's fair, if you have your own television show, to give your own opinion. ... They didn't let Barack off the hook a lot either, you know, when they said, \"Is there anything you would like sir, a little more coffee. ... \" Of course it's fair.

Baby Manjhi and her grandmother flew to Osaka, Japan, from the Indian capital, New Delhi, Saturday night, said family friend, Kamal Vijay Vargiya. While some countries have banned surrogacy as a money-making venture, it has been legal in India since 2002. Under the practice, infertile couples are matched with local women to carry babies for $12,000 to $30,000. Baby Manjhi was conceived when a Japanese couple paid a clinic in India to have the husband's sperm and an anonymous donor's egg implanted in the womb of an Indian surrogate. The plan worked. But a few months before Manjhi was born, the couple divorced. The intended Japanese mother decided she did not want the baby. Manjhi was born on July 25. Her father, Ikufumi Yamada, and grandmother traveled from Japan to pick her up and take her to her new home. But Indian law stipulates that a mother must be present in order for a baby to receive a passport. In this case, neither the birth mother nor the mother who had originally sought the child wanted to be involved. Manjhi's father looked into a legal adoption, but Indian law does not allow single men to adopt. The case garnered international headlines. Eventually, Manjhi was issued a birth certificate with just her father's name on it. And on Saturday, she left for Osaka to be reunited with him. \"This is for the first time in 28 years in Jaipur that somebody (in such a situation) has been issued travel documents by Indian authorities. And this became possible mainly because of media,\" said Sanjay Arya, the doctor who treated Manjhi at a Jaipur hospital. -- CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report .", "ed0596e6105b2d827647ada10505f448c47b9be9": "(CNN) -- Iraq's presidency council Thursday approved the U.S.-Iraq security agreement -- the final step for the agreement to be ratified by the Iraqi government, a council spokesman said. The pact allows the presence of American troops in Iraq for three more years. U.S. soldiers gather at the \"Crossed Swords\" in Baghdad's secure Green Zone on Tuesday. The three-member presidency council -- Kurdish President Jalal Talabani, Shiite Vice President Adel Abdul Mehdi and Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi -- approved the agreement unanimously a week after the Iraqi parliament passed the measure. Under the Iraqi constitution, unanimous approval by the presidency council is required for ratification of a law or agreement. The security pact will replace a U.N. mandate for the U.S. presence in Iraq that expires at the end of this year. The agreement, reached after months of negotiations, sets June 30, 2009, as the deadline for U.S. combat troops to withdraw from all Iraqi cities and towns. The date for all U.S. troops to leave Iraq is December 31, 2011. The agreement -- which stresses respect for Iraqi sovereignty -- \"requests the temporary assistance\" of U.S. forces, but severely restricts their role. The pact says that all military operations are to be carried out with the agreement of Iraq and must be \"fully coordinated\" with Iraqis. A Joint Military Operations Coordination Committee will oversee military operations. Iraq has the \"primary right to exercise jurisdiction\" over U.S. forces \"for grave premeditated felonies,\" the agreement says. Suspects can be held by U.S. forces but must be available to Iraqi authorities for investigation or trial. Iraq also will have the \"primary right to exercise jurisdiction\" over U.S. contractors and their employees under the agreement. Also, the pact says that \"Iraqi land, sea and air shouldn't be used as a launching or transit point for attacks against other countries.\" The presidency council also approved a U.S.-Iraqi bilateral pact called the strategic framework agreement, which covers a wide range of bilateral cooperation efforts and which was approved by the Iraqi parliament last week. U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan C. Crocker and Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. military official in Iraq, issued a statement welcoming the council's ratification of the measures. \"We look forward, under these agreements, to the continued reduction in U.S. forces and the normalization of bilateral relations as two sovereign and co-equal nations,\" the two said in their statement. \"We will undertake initiatives to strengthen our cooperation in the fields of economics, energy, health, the environment, education, culture, and law enforcement.

The consecration of Rev. Gene Robinson as bishop of New Hampshire left many conservatives disaffected. Leaders of the new Anglican Church in North America unveiled a draft constitution and a set of canons for the province -- or ecclesiastical territorial division -- at an evening service at the Wheaton Evangelical Free Church in Wheaton, Illinois, the group said in a written statement. \"Some of us have been praying for this for decades,\" said Michael W. Howell, who attended the service, according to the statement. \"Instead of focusing on things that divide us, we as orthodox Anglicans are focusing on the things that unite us.\" \"The public release of our draft constitution is an important concrete step toward the goal of a biblical, missionary and united Anglican Church in North America,\" Bishop Robert Duncan of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, diocese said in a statement released Wednesday ahead of the service. The move comes after years of debate over several issues, ranging from interpretation of the Bible to homosexuality. Tensions reached a boiling point in 2003, when the Episcopal Church consecrated an openly gay man, Rev. Gene Robinson, as bishop of New Hampshire. The decision rankled traditionalists, and since then, four dioceses and several parishes have left the Episcopalian Church, including the diocese in Pittsburgh. The others are in Quincy, Illinois; Fort Worth, Texas; and San Joaquin, California. Not all parishes in those dioceses have left the Episcopalian Church. In all, the Anglican Church in North America will take in about 100,000 members, including those from the secessionist dioceses and parishes, said Robert Lundy, a spokesman for the group. \"This constitution brings them back together under one church, all aligned together,\" Lundy said. \"This is all these folks coming back together.\" The preamble to the provisional constitution says the leaders are \"grieved by the current state of brokenness within the Anglican Communion prompted by those who have embraced erroneous teaching and who have rejected a repeated call to repentance,\" the group said. Lundy said Wednesday the draft constitution states the province's core beliefs and doctrine. He said it will not lay out definite policies for issues the leaders disagree on, such as ordaining women. He said it is \"safe to say\" Duncan will lead the nascent province. An assembly is likely to be called next year to determine additional leadership, he said. A spokesman for the archbishop of Canterbury issued a statement noting the lengthy process of creating a province, adding that in the case of Wednesday's service, the process has not yet begun. \"There are clear guidelines set out in the Anglican Consultative Council Reports ... detailing the steps necessary for the amendments of existing provincial constitutions and the creation of new provinces,\" said James M. Rosenthal, canon to Archbishop Rowan Williams. \"Once begun, any of these processes will take years to complete. In relation to the recent announcement from the meeting ... the process has not yet begun.\" The Rev. Dr. Charles K. Robertson, canon to the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, Katharine Jefferts Schori, issued a statement Wednesday ahead of the meeting, saying the church would not hazard a guess as to the consequences of the breakaway group's action. \"We will not predict what will or will not come out of this meeting, but simply continue to be clear that the Episcopal Church, along with the Anglican Church of Canada and the La Iglesia Anglicana de Mexico, comprise the official, recognized presence of the Anglican Communion in North America.\" He added, \"We reiterate what has been true of Anglicanism for centuries: that there is room within the Episcopal Church for people with different views, and we regret that some have felt the need to depart from the diversity of our common life in Christ.\" The Episcopal Church is part of the Anglican Communion, which is composed of 38 provinces around the world. It was not immediately clear which of the other provinces would recognize the Anglican Church in North America, but Lundy said a meeting last year in Jerusalem indicated that some would do so.", "c1ffbcdb6ccc8b34211535bee122ed0f10ae3235": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. John McCain on Thursday accused Sen. Barack Obama of breaking a promise when the Democrat decided to forgo public financing in this fall's campaign. Sen. Barack Obama repeatedly broke campaign fundraising records during the Democratic primary season. Obama told supporters in an e-mail message Thursday that he would not accept about $85 million in public funds when he becomes the Democratic presidential nominee. In the e-mail, Obama said the public campaign financing system allowed \"special interests [to] drown out the voices of the American people\" and asked his supporters to \"declare our independence from a broken system.\" McCain said that Obama's move to drop out of the system \"should be disturbing to all Americans\" and that he may decide to opt out, too. \"Sen. Obama's reversal on public financing is one of a number of reversals ... that he has taken,\" McCain said while touring flood-damaged parts of Iowa. \"This election is about a lot of things, but it's also about trust. It's also about whether you can take people's word. ... He said he would stick to his agreement. He didn't.\"  Watch McCain's attack on Obama \u00bb . He said his campaign will reconsider whether to opt out as well. \"We''l have to reevaluate in light of his decision,\" he said. But he said he leans toward taking public money. But Rep. Rahm Emanuel, an Obama supporter, argued that the Democrat had \"more than realized the objective of public financing\" by setting up a system to accept small donations over the Internet. \"It has given the American people a voice in our political process and has forever changed politics in this country by inspiring record numbers of Americans to participate in bringing change to Washington,\" Emanuel said. Despite the heated back-and-forth, CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said it is unlikely the controversy will influence voters. \"I'm not sure it's a big deal for most voters. There's not a lot of support for the public financing system.\" Schneider said. \"About a year ago, the polls asked people if they supported the idea that candidates and campaigns should be financed by taxpayer money ... and most persons said no. \"They like the idea of financing campaigns through small contributions from a lot of individual contributors, which is what Obama has done,\" he said. Obama would be the first major presidential candidate to drop out of the modern campaign financing system for the general election since its creation in 1976 in the post-Watergate era. Under this system, candidates agree to spend only the public funds and cannot raise or spend money directly obtained from individuals. Because he has decided not participate in the system, Obama will be able to spend an unlimited amount of money during the general election. The two camps also bickered Thursday over whether they had held negotiations on public financing before Obama's move to drop out. Obama counsel Bob Bauer said he discussed the public funding issue for 45 minutes with Trevor Potter, his McCain counterpart, on June 6 when they met to talk about a possible town-hall appearance between the candidates. Potter said the two \"spoke in general terms about the public financing system, with Bob outlining reasons it could be considered 'broken' or irrelevant in 2008, and I explaining why Sen. McCain remained committed to it and thought it was good for the country.\" Given his record-breaking ability to raise donations over the Internet, the Illinois Democrat probably will be able to raise more than and outspend the presumptive GOP nominee.  Watch CNN's Candy Crowley explain the significance of Obama's decision \u00bb . Since January 2007, Obama has raised more than $272 million, including nearly $31 million in April. During that time period, McCain has raised less than half that amount, roughly $100 million. In April, the Arizona Republican brought in about $18 million. The FEC ruled unanimously in March 2007 that presidential candidates could accept general election public financing, provided that they return any money raised for the general election while following certain guidelines. At the time, Obama's actions appeared to be a desire on his part to preserve the public financing option while enabling him to raise general election money. After that ruling, spokesman Bill Burton said, \"Sen. Obama is pleased the FEC took this important step in preserving the public financing system, which is why he sought the opinion. If Sen. Obama is the nominee, he will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.\" McCain is embroiled in controversy over his attempt to withdraw from the primary public financing system. He entered the program last year when his campaign was strapped for cash, and took a loan using future fundraising -- or the matching funds from the public financing system -- as collateral. But after his primary victories on Super Tuesday, McCain wrote to the Federal Elections Commission announcing his intent to withdraw from the program. But the FEC has four vacancies -- and no quorum -- to vote on whether to allow McCain's withdrawal. And federal election rules say that a candidate who uses the matching funds as collateral cannot withdraw from the system. The Democratic National Committee has filed a complaint with the FEC, but the lack of a quorum has stalled assessment of the complaint. Obama, meanwhile, asked supporters Thursday to \"declare our independence from a broken system, and run the type of campaign that reflects the grass-roots values that have already changed our politics and brought us this far.\" The Democrat also attacked McCain and Republicans for taking money from lobbyists and political action committees, and he faulted McCain for not checking the campaign spending of conservative groups independent from his campaign. \"We've already seen that he's not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so-called 527 groups, who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations,\" the e-mail said, referring to independent political advocacy groups that often purchase issue ads independent of the presidential campaigns. These groups operate under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Service tax code.

Simpson, convicted of armed robbery and kidnapping, deserves leniency in sentencing as he is a first-time offender who showed no criminal intent, his attorney says in court papers. O.J. Simpson should receive a six-year sentence in a 2007 hotel room confrontation, his attorney says. Attorney Gabriel Grasso argued that Simpson should receive the minimum sentence, six years. Grasso acknowledged in court papers, \"Clearly Simpson was not using good judgment\" during a 2007 hotel room confrontation over sports memorabilia. Simpson could receive a maximum life sentence from Judge Jackie Glass on Friday. A pre-sentencing report recommended an 18-year sentence. On October 3, a jury convicted Simpson, 61, and co-defendant Clarence \"C.J.\" Stewart of 12 charges, including conspiracy to commit a crime, robbery, assault and kidnapping with a deadly weapon.  Watch Stewart talk about the night they were arrested \u00bb . Their convictions stem from a September 13, 2007, fracas at the Palace Station Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Prosecutors alleged that Simpson led a group of men who used threats, guns and force to take sports memorabilia from dealers Bruce Fromong and Al Beardsley. Simpson said he was attempting to recover items that belonged to him. Four men charged with Simpson cut deals with the prosecution and testified against him. One testified that Simpson asked him to bring a gun to the encounter. \"These were not crimes committed on strangers, but were acts stemming from prior relationships with the individuals in the room at the Palace Station,\" Grasso wrote in the memorandum. \"There was overwhelming evidence at trial that Simpson's intent was to recover property that was his and only his,\" the lawyer argued. \"The trial testimony showed Simpson's intent was to return anything that did not belong to him. This intention can be heard throughout the recordings of the Palace Station incident.\" He added,  \"However, there is nothing in the record to show that Simpson evinced a criminal mind or showed the requisite criminal intent.\" Because of that and other factors, Grasso wrote, Simpson's sentence should fall on the low end of the minimum sentencing range. In a sentencing brief for Stewart, 54, defense attorney E. Brent Byron said his client also should be sentenced to six years, noting he \"did not kill anyone, nor did he bind or gag anyone.\" He had no weapon and \"no witness testified that Mr. Stewart knew that weapons were going to be used,\" the brief said. Both sentencing memorandums note that one of the victims, Beardsley, did not even want the case prosecuted. Attorneys for both Simpson and Stewart have filed motions seeking a new trial. Simpson's lawyers cite seven reasons why a new trial should be granted in their brief, including that he was denied a fair hearing when two African-Americans were dismissed from the potential jury pool.

Eight of the United States' 13 missile defense tests have been deemed a success. The ground-based interceptor missile, launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, destroyed a long-range ballistic missile launched from Kodiak, Alaska, the Defense Department's Missile Defense Agency said. But one key aspect of the test -- to see whether the system could tell the difference between a missile and a decoy aimed at confounding its \"seek\" systems -- failed because the decoy did not deploy. Officials told CNN on Thursday that Friday's test would be the most realistic of 13 missile shield system tests conducted to date. Eight of the 13 tests have now been deemed a success by the Pentagon.  Watch a Pentagon spokesman explain the Friday's problem \u00bb . This was the first test in which a crew at an alternate fire control center in Alaska remotely launched the interceptor missile from California. The \"initial indications,\" according to the Defense Department, are that all components of Friday's test performed as designed. Critics have long complained that the tests are not realistic because they don't involve balloons or other simple decoys that, they argue, could easily fool the interceptor.  Watch a report on the defense system \u00bb . In Friday's test, however, the target was a mock warhead and was supposed to be accompanied by \"countermeasures similar to what Iran or North Korea could deploy,\" according to a missile defense agency official. The intention was for the interceptor's kill vehicle to distinguish the target from the decoys. But the decoy that was supposed to deploy to test the system did not. The Pentagon blamed a 40-year-old target system. \"Countermeasures are very difficult to deploy. We have had trouble deploying them in the past,\" said Lt. Gen. Patrick J. O'Reilly, director for the Missile Defense Agency. But O'Reilly said that the interceptor did differentiate between the actual missile target and the upper stage of the missile it had detached from. The test, which had been delayed several times, comes at a crucial time for the $100 billion system, as President-elect Barack Obama is about to take office. Early in his campaign, Obama pledged to \"cut investments in unproven missile defense systems.\" But he later said he would support missile defense systems if they work. \"The biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons,\" Obama said in the September 26 presidential debate. \"And we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons.\" Friday's test also showed the Pentagon that multiple sensor systems were able to network together and hone in on a single object, O'Reilly said. \"All those sensors working together, at any one time the system knew which sensor was reporting what and tracking it and gave the war fighter one presentation of a target,\" O'Reilly said soon after the test was finished. \"That was one tremendous accomplishment for us.\" Last month, the outgoing head of the Missile Defense Agency said that not only are U.S. missile defenses workable, they are up and running. \"Our testing has shown not only can we hit a bullet with a bullet, we can hit a spot on the bullet with a bullet. The technology has caught up,\" Lt. Gen. Trey Obering said.

Kate Meinhardt crammed her life into a 21-square-foot room while she lived aboard a circus train. Bungee cords crisscrossed her walls once a week to prevent an avalanche of items from raining down. A microwave, mini refrigerator, her laptop and baskets of personal items lined the dorm-like room. Showering, going to the bathroom and even doing laundry became racing contests on the train, Meinhardt said. The 13 people on board shared one shower, two toilets and one washer and dryer. \"It's a pretty tough life living in such a small space,\" she said. The 23-year-old spent almost a year as an animal handler for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. While most iReporters haven't run off to join the circus, some have traded in their homes for smaller digs. One iReporter even opted for a floating lifestyle, where he could sail away at a moment's notice. iReport.com: Living in tight quarters . Living on a 25-foot boat was only supposed to be temporary, but Jim Smith loved it so much he stayed there for a year. \"I have lived in a 25-foot sailboat, a 28-foot motor home, a 32-foot sailboat and now an 800 square-foot apartment,\" Smith said in his iReport. \"I was happiest with the 25-foot sailboat.\" While docked in Panama City, Florida, Smith kept his expenses to a minimum. The marina slip rent was only $200 and electricity was included in the rent, he said. The boat did not have refrigeration so Smith kept his food inside an insulated ice box. For 79 cents at the discount grocery store, he could buy a 10-pound bag of ice that would last him several days, even during the summer. Air conditioning wasn't a luxury Smith had either, but fans and sea breezes kept him cool. \"Sometimes the less you have, the more you like it,\" he said. The portable lifestyle also charmed a father-son duo who set out on a yearlong European vacation. A camper van took them wherever they wanted, whenever they wanted. Spencer Pearson and his 15-year-old son, Bryce, bought a 150-square-foot van in Germany for their European excursion. Living out of the van meant \"no reservations, no packing and unpacking of suitcases, no strange beds,\" Pearson said. Modern amenities weren't amiss on the van, which included everything from the Internet and entertainment to a complete bath and kitchen, and there were occasional hotel stays and meals out that made the trip more pleasant. The simple life also enticed Deborah Greant and her husband to trade in their Calgary, Canada, home for an RV. Both she and her husband have neuromuscular problems and needed extra help taking care of their large home. Since moving into a 240-square-foot RV, they can manage the house themselves. \"We didn't want to be owned by our things,\" Greant said. \"We jettisoned pretty much everything except things from former generations.\" While two people living in an RV can be tight, imagine a family of six trying to do the same. Mounting living expenses and a job relocation prompted the Chervenkas to sell their home and move into a 32-foot RV. Two pets came along, too. The Chervenkas weren't forced to do this. Their goal was to become debt-free and save money for their children's college educations. When pilot Tim Chervenka got transferred to Charlotte, North Carolina, the family set up camp in a 32-foot RV. The temporary situation turned into a permanent one. The family said goodbye to paying a first and second mortgage and pricey utilities. They now pay only $500 a month, utilities included. \"It's made such an adjustment in our personal life without the juggling,\" Cindy Chervenka said. \"We have so much more family time. It's a good feeling.\" Cindy Chervenka has some advice for others thinking of a drastic downsizing: \"Step out of your comfort zone and try it. We didn't plan on doing this full-time, but once we discovered it, we thought, 'hey we can do this forever!' Until you step out and try it, you'll think it's not doable.\"", "69594f786c934ebdcfc4af1a2db9d703db3fca3a": "(CNN) -- Breakaway conservative members of the Episcopal Church in the United States and its Canadian counterpart are expected to formally announce Wednesday the formation of a rival North American Anglican church. The consecration of Rev. Gene Robinson as bishop of New Hampshire left many conservatives disaffected. Leaders of the Common Cause Partnership, a network of more than 100,000 Anglican Christians in North America, are expected to unveil a draft constitution for a new ecclesiastical territorial division, or province, at an evening service in Wheaton Evangelical Free Church in Wheaton, Illinois, the group said in a written statement. \"The public release of our draft constitution is an important concrete step toward the goal of a biblical, missionary and united Anglican Church in North America,\" Bishop Robert Duncan of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, diocese, said in the written statement. The move comes after years of debate over issues from the interpretation of the Bible to homosexuality. Tensions reached a boiling point in 2003, when the Episcopal Church consecrated an openly gay man, Rev. Gene Robinson, as bishop of New Hampshire. The move outraged worshippers with traditionalist tendencies, and since then, four dioceses and several parishes have left the Episcopalian Church, including Duncan's Pittsburgh diocese. In all, the newly formed division will consist of about 100,000 members from the secessionist dioceses and parishes, along with splinter groups that had left the Episcopalian Church in earlier years, said Robert Lundy, a spokesman for the group . \"This constitution brings them back together under one church, all aligned together,\" Lundy said. \"This is all these folks coming back together.\" Lunday said it was safe to say Duncan will lead the nascent province. An assembly is likely to be called next year to determine additional leadership, he said. The Rev. Dr. Charles K. Robertson, canon to the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, Katharine Jefferts Schori, issued a statement saying it would not hazard a guess as to the consequences of Wednesday's service. \"We will not predict what will or will not come out of this meeting, but simply continue to be clear that the Episcopal Church, along with the Anglican Church of Canada and the La Iglesia Anglicana de Mexico, comprise the official, recognized presence of the Anglican Communion in North America,\" he said. \"We reiterate what has been true of Anglicanism for centuries: that there is room within the Episcopal Church for people with different views, and we regret that some have felt the need to depart from the diversity of our common life in Christ.\" The Episcopal Church is part of the Anglican Communion, which is composed of 38 provinces around the world. It was not immediately clear which of the other provinces would recognize the Anglican Church in North America, but Lundy said in a meeting last year in Jerusalem indicated that some would do so. Lundy said the draft constitution will state the province's core beliefs and doctrine. He said it will not lay out definite policies for issues the leaders disagree on, such as ordaining women.", "c9a8fd1367f993937b0fb2af2f82a9be1dc317d0": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Two UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters collided Saturday night while landing in northern Baghdad, killing one Iraqi soldier, a U.S. military spokesman said.

The judge told Boy George he faced jail. Norwegian Audun Carlsen, 29, said the frontman with the 1980s band beat him with a metal chain as he tried to flee his London flat after a naked photo shoot. A jury at a London court found on Friday that the case was proven against the 46-year-old musician -- tried under his real name of George O'Dowd. The singer declined to give evidence during the trial but the jury heard he told police he handcuffed Carlsen to his bed while he investigated alleged tampering with his computer. Carlsen told the court O'Dowd invented the story about computer tampering so he could punish him for not having sex at a previous meeting. He said: \"I think he couldn't handle the refusal -- me not having sex with him.\" O'Dowd looked grim as the verdict was delivered, according to the Press Association. The singer was bailed until sentencing on January 16. Judge David Radford warned him that he was likely to face jail. \"The fact that your bail is being continued does not imply that this will be dealt with by a non-custodial sentence.

Sandra Samuel bravely saved the life of Moshe Holtzberg, 2, but says she sees no heroism in her actions. But Sandra Samuel sees no heroism in her actions amid last week's terror attacks on India's financial capital that killed nearly 180 people -- including baby Moshe's parents, Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife, Rivka. She only wishes she could have done more. \"Even today, I am thinking I should have sent the baby and done something for the rabbi and his wife,\" Samuel told CNN in an exclusive television interview in Israel, where she now lives. Samuel and Moshe were among the few to make it out of the Chabad House alive after gunmen stormed the Jewish center, killing the Holtzbergs and four others. Israel's Chabad movement has set up a fund to provide for Moshe's care. He is being looked after by members of the community, although who will serve as his guardian has not yet been established. The nanny says she came face to face with a gunman late Wednesday, the first night of the siege. \"I saw one man was shooting at me -- he shot at me.\"  Watch CNN's Paula Hancocks talk with Samuel \u00bb . She slammed a door and hid in a first-floor storage room and attempted to reach the rabbi and the others on the second floor. Overnight, Samuel frantically tried to call for help as gunfire and grenade blasts shook the Chabad House. Samuel says she emerged early the next afternoon, when she heard Moshe calling for her. She found the child crying as he stood between his parents, who she says appeared unconscious but still alive. Based on the marks on Moshe's back, she believes he was struck so hard by a gunman that he fell unconscious at some point as well. \"First thing is that a baby is very important for me and this baby is something very precious to me and that's what made me just not think anything -- just pick up the baby and run,\" Samuel said. \"When I hear gunshot, it's not one or 20. It's like a hundred gunshots,\" she added. \"Even I'm a mother of two children so I just pick up the baby and run. Does anyone think of dying at the moment when there's a small, precious baby?\"  Watch Samuel describe the escape \u00bb . Outside, chaos flooded the streets as people tried to make sense of the massacre that killed at least 179 people and wounded 300 others. Ultimately, she and Moshe reached safety at the home of an Israeli consul before arriving in Israel, where she is considered a hero. In the aftermath of the attacks, Moshe asked for his mother continuously, Samuel says, and he is learning to play again -- though he likes the nanny close by. And while she still has nightmares of the horrific siege that took hold of Mumbai, Samuel, a non-Jew and native of India, said she will stay in Israel for as long as Moshe needs her.  Watch as Samuel describes boy asking for his mother \u00bb . \"Yes, yes, they said it is important I am here,\" she said. \"Me, I just take care of the baby.\"", "dcebe447c665a12ff14efffe32152cd0785e5204": "Sara, 29, has lived in Miami for five years, where she works as freelance writer and film maker. Her blog, All Purpose Dark, keeps tabs on the city's nightlife and restaurants, and she is also the editor of the Miami edition of UrbanDaddy.com. Sara has lived in Miami for five years and says the city has a vibrant arts scene. CNN: What made you start blogging the city? Sara: When I moved down here I realized there was so much more to the city than just the beach and the hotels. There were lots of extravagant condo-building parties at the time -- the type where you'd go to the construction site, because the building was still in the planning stages, and they'd throw this lavish catered party with open bar and feather dancers in an effort to get people to buy units. We were going to at least three of these events a week and I felt the need to document it. So my blog started out as kind of a nightlife, event-driven blog and eventually became a chronicle of my adventures in the city, focused now mostly on my eating adventures. CNN: What makes Miami so special to you? Sara: I think Miami is a place of unbridled optimism. It's also a place of great opportunity. There's lots of room here for entrepreneurial spirit and it's very much encouraged and appreciated. Just look at how much the city has changed in five years, in terms of the revival of Downtown and the Design District, and the thriving art scene. It's a place that is still evolving identity-wise and I'm excited to be a part of it. CNN: Is there anything you dislike about the city? Sara: The seasonal aspect of the city can be frustrating -- the way it shuts down in the summer and then revs up in the winter. Also, the crowding in the winter, when all the seasonal residents come back and suddenly there are no parking spaces, the lines at the grocery store are horrendous and you realize you're trying to live in a tourist Mecca and get your errands done when everyone around you is vacationing. Oh and the drivers -- possibly the worst driving etiquette in the country. CNN: Is Miami just about the sun and sand, or is there more to it? Sara: There's definitely more to this city than the tropical getaway. There's a vibrant art scene, where each month the gallery district is alive with opening receptions and throngs of people interested in getting out and seeing the scene. There's also the internationally renowned Art Basel art fair that comes to town every year putting Miami on the cultural map. Also, food-wise there's lots of exciting things going on, from an incredibly diverse selection of Latin cuisine. Everything from Argentinean to Venezuelan food, to Haitian, to Caribbean -- there's a ton of great ethnic food here. There's also a growing high-end dining scene, where a lot of the national trends, like organic, locally sourced cooking, are happening on a very high level. CNN: Could you describe a typical Miamian's weekend? Sara: A typical weekend would probably entail going to dinner in the Design District on Friday night, going for a walk or a bike ride along the beach on Saturday morning, then lunch on Lincoln Road. Saturday night there are usually some great DJs in town, so it's worth checking out the Downtown club scene, or if it's Art Walk, the galleries in Wynwood. Sunday is spent perusing farmers markets, which are popping up in most neighborhoods, and lazily reading the paper over brunch. Sunday night is always bingo at the Standard hotel, a hipster hangout. CNN: Where do you shop? Sara: I usually head to the Aventura Mall if I'm looking to hit a bunch of stores in one fix. There's Bloomingdales, Urban Outfitters and your typical mall stores, like Banana Republic, etc. Collins Avenue in South Beach between 10th and 6th is good for Barney's Co-op (where there's always a sale), Intermix and the Webster. CNN: If Miami was a person, what would she or he be like? Sara: Attractive, laid back and stylish. Loves the beach and the sun but is also involved in a personal creative pursuit -- business, fashion, art or nightlife. .................................. Do you agree with Sara?

Susanne Klatten holds a 12.5-percent stake in BMW. Susanne Klatten's spokesman Joerg Appelhans told CNN Tuesday that the BMW heiress alerted police in January this year that she was the victim of fraud and blackmail by a man he identified as Mr. S. Appelhans said the man had been threatening since autumn 2007 to release pictures of their \"meetings\" together. Klatten \"came to the conclusion that the relationship with Mr. S. was of a solely criminal nature,\" Appelhans said. Some German media reports say Klatten is one of four rich German women who have been preyed on by the same gang. \"His goal was from the beginning to con her and to blackmail her into giving him money. She rigorously notified authorities even in light of the uncomfortable public repercussions this would have for her. The ensuing criminal investigation led to the arrest of the perpetrator,\" Appelhans added. \"The blackmailing with pictures of the meetings they had began in the fall of 2007. First, the blackmailer demanded a loan of several million euros.

Wall Street traders had been watching developments in Washington closely. The House rejected the original bill on Monday, sending stocks tumbling around the world. But lawmakers approved the rescue package, backed by U.S. President George W. Bush and Treasury chiefs, Friday after the U.S. Senate passed it by a large majority on Wednesday. Congress voted 263 to 171 in favor of the bailout bill. President Bush signed the bill into law Friday afternoon. Stocks on Wall Street slumped Friday, as the brutal week ended. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.5 percent, according to early tallies. For the week, the Dow ended down 818 points, the biggest weekly point loss in seven years and the third-biggest weekly loss on a point basis ever. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1.4 percent Friday and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.5 percent. Bush thanked all those involved and said the bill was essential to stopping the crisis on Wall Street becoming a crisis in the wider economy. Bush said it sent a message to the rest of the world that the U.S. was ready to take action to ease the credit crunch. He said it would take sometime for the bill to have an impact on the American economy. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said he applauded the vote. \"It demonstrates the government's commitment to do what it takes to support and strengthen our economy. The legislation is a critical step toward stabilizing our financial markets and ensuring an uninterrupted flow of credit to households and businesses. \"The Federal Reserve will continue to work closely with the Treasury as it undertakes these new initiatives. We will continue to use all of the powers at our disposal to mitigate credit market disruptions and to foster a strong, vibrant economy,\" Bernanke said. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, the author of the plan, said Americans would appreciate the leadership of their elected representatives. \"We will move rapidly to implement the new authorities, but we will also move methodically,\" he said. Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said after the vote that hearings would be held into how the U.S. economy end up needing the bailout. Pelosi said the U.S. needed regulatory reform to prevent the same situation being repeated in the future. She said a much better bill may have been achievable in different circumstances, but the situation was urgent and middle class needed to be protected. Stock markets around the world have endured days of turmoil as a consequence of uncertainty over Washington's response to the credit crisis. U.S. markets opened brightly Friday, following heavy losses the previous day, amid fresh expectation that the bailout plan would go through. By 11.50 a.m. (1550 GMT) the Dow Jones was up 1.79 percent and the Nasdaq was up 2.80 percent. Asian markets slipped earlier in the day with Japan's Nikkei Exchange closing the week down 215.05 points, or about 1.9 percent at 10,939.71 -- a new three-year low. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 2.9 percent to 17,682.40 and key indexes across the region were all down. European markets were flat in morning trading, but rallied after Wall Street opened with London's FTSE 100 up 2.15 percent, Paris' CAC up 2.96 percent and Frankfurt's DAX up 2.55 percent. The banking world has been in turmoil in recent weeks with many institutions scrambling for survival as credit has dried up, leaving many holding \"toxic\" subprime debt following the collapse in U.S. house prices.

Blog: Will the bailout plan fix the economy? The changes -- including $110 billion in tax breaks and raising the limit at which bank deposits are guaranteed from $100,000 to $250,000 -- were intended to attract more votes from the House -- especially from Republicans, two-thirds of whom voted against that version. Explainer: What next for the bailout plan? But the bill also includes some odd sweeteners -- so-called \"pork-barrel legislation\" -- such as an excise tax exemption for a very specific type of arrow used by child archers, a $478 million tax incentive scheme to encourage movie companies to continue producing films in the U.S, and measures to allow employers to provide benefits to employees who commute to work by bike.

Simpson will serve at least nine years in prison for his role in an armed confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas hotel in 2007. O.J. Simpson told the judge Friday that he was sorry for what he did but didn't think it was wrong. Simpson was sentenced to a maximum of 33 years with the possibility of parole after nine. Before the sentence, he offered a rambling, emotional apology in which he told District Judge Jackie Glass, his voice shaking, that he was sorry for his actions but believed he did nothing wrong. Glass, however, brushed his apology aside, saying his actions amounted to \"much more than stupidity,\" and calling him both arrogant and ignorant. \"Earlier in this case, at a bail hearing, I said to Mr. Simpson, I didn't know if he was arrogant, ignorant or both,\" Glass said. \"During the trial and through this proceeding, I got the answer, and it was both.\" She stressed that the sentence was not \"payback for anything else,\" apparently referring to Simpson's acquittal 13 years ago in the slayings of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman.

Defense attorneys said Glass' sentence was appropriate. \"It could have been a lot worse,\" Yale Galanter said, noting that Simpson and co-defendant Clarence \"C.J.\" Stewart both could have been sentenced to life in prison. A jury convicted Simpson, 61, and Stewart, 54, on 12 charges including conspiracy to commit a crime, robbery, assault and kidnapping with a deadly weapon stemming from a September 13, 2007, incident at Las Vegas' Palace Station hotel and casino. Prosecutors alleged that Simpson led a group of men who used threats, guns and force to take sports memorabilia from dealers Bruce Fromong and Al Beardsley. Simpson claimed that he was attempting to recover items that belonged to him. All the men except Stewart made deals with prosecutors in exchange for their testimony. \"We're happy that this case is coming to an end,\" Clark County district attorney David Roger said. \"We're satisfied that we presented a good case to a jury, that the jury listened to all the evidence, particularly the audiotapes, and came to the resolution that we asked them to come to.\" He said he thought the sentence was fair.

Glass said, \"I'm not here to sentence Mr. Simpson for what's happened in his life previously in the criminal justice system. ... The jury decided. There are many people who disagree with that verdict, but that doesn't matter to me.\" Goldman's father and sister were in the courtroom for Friday's sentencing. \"The back of his head looks the same as it did every day that we watched him in the criminal case, and we feel very proud of our efforts,\" Kim Goldman said. \"We feel very strongly that because of our pursuit of him for all these years, that it did drive him to the brink of this.\" Although Simpson was acquitted in the deaths, a civil jury later found him liable, slapping him with a $33 million judgment. Attorneys for the Goldman family have doggedly pursued Simpson's financial assets to pay the judgment. In sentencing Simpson on Friday, Glass noted that he can be heard on tapes of the incident referring to the Goldmans as \"gold-diggers\" and saying he doesn't want them to get his property.

Before being sentenced, Simpson told Glass he was \"sorry, somewhat confused, apologetic.\" He said the items he was trying to recover were his late ex-wife's wedding ring for his daughter and family photos for his son.  Watch Simpson's apology \u00bb . \"I just wanted my personal things. I was stupid. I'm sorry,\" Simpson said. \"I didn't know I was doing anything illegal. I thought I was confronting friends. I thought I was retrieving my things. I didn't mean to hurt anybody, and I didn't mean to steal anything.\" But Glass rejected those statements in imposing the sentence. \"When you take a gun with you and you take men with you ... in a show of force, that's not just a 'Hey, give me my stuff back,' \" Glass said. \"That's something else. And that's what went on here, and that's why we're all here. \"I have to tell you, it was much more than stupidity. ... You went to the room, you took guns -- meaning you and the group -- you used force, you took property, whether it was yours or somebody else's, and in this state, that amounts to robbery with the use of a deadly weapon.\" The judge said Simpson's contrite words in court were not as powerful as his angry words, as caught on tape, during the confrontation. \"Everything in this case was on tape,\" Glass said. \"The evidence in this case was overwhelming.\" Simpson's attorneys asked that he be sentenced to no more than six years. A presentencing report recommended an 18-year term. Stewart received a sentence similar to Simpson's but will be eligible for parole in 7\u00bd years. \"I am as happy as someone could be when they know their client is going to reside for at least seven years in a cage,\" said Stewart's attorney, Brent Bryson. Defense attorneys for both Simpson and Stewart have said they will appeal. On Friday, Glass denied motions asking that both defendants be allowed out on bail while the appeal is pending.

Lift to space: This is a NASA interpretation of what a space elevator may look like. The project is a \"space elevator,\" and some experts now believe that the concept is well within the bounds of possibility -- maybe even within our lifetimes. A conference discussing developments in space elevator concepts is being held in Japan in November, and hundreds of engineers and scientists from Asia, Europe and the Americas are working to design the only lift that will take you directly to the one hundred-thousandth floor. Despite these developments, you could be excused for thinking it all sounds a little far-fetched. Indeed, if successfully built, the space elevator would be an unprecedented feat of human engineering. A cable anchored to the Earth's surface, reaching tens of thousands of kilometers into space, balanced with a counterweight attached at the other end is the basic design for the elevator. It is thought that inertia -- the physics theory stating that matter retains its velocity along a straight line so long as it is not acted upon by an external force -- will cause the cable to stay stretched taut, allowing the elevator to sit in geostationary orbit. The cable would extend into the sky, eventually reaching a satellite docking station orbiting in space. Engineers hope the elevator will transport people and objects into space, and there have even been suggestions that it could be used to dispose of nuclear waste. Another proposed idea is to use the elevator to place solar panels in space to provide power for homes on Earth. If it sounds like the stuff of fiction, maybe that's because it once was. In 1979, Arthur C. Clarke's novel \"The Fountains of Paradise\" brought the idea of a space elevator to a mass audience. Charles Sheffield's \"The Web Between the Worlds\" also featured the building of a space elevator. But, jump out of the storybooks and fast-forward nearly three decades, and Japanese scientists at the Japan Space Elevator Association are working seriously on the space-elevator project. Association spokesman Akira Tsuchida said his organization was working with U.S.-based Spaceward Foundation and a European organization based in Luxembourg to develop an elevator design. The Liftport Group in the U.S. is also working on developing a design, and in  total it's believed that more than 300 scientists and engineers are engaged in such work around the globe. NASA is holding a $4 million Space Elevator Challenge to encourage designs for a successful space elevator. Tsuchida said the technology driving the race to build the first space elevator is the quickly developing material carbon nanotube. It is lightweight and has a tensile strength 180 times stronger than that of a steel cable. Currently, it is the only material with the potential to be strong enough to use to manufacture elevator cable, according to Tsuchida. \"At present we have a tether which is made of carbon nanotube, and has one-third or one-quarter of the strength required to make a space elevator. We expect that we will have strong enough cable in the 2020s or 2030s,\" Tsuchida said. He said the most likely method of powering the elevator would be through the carbon nanotube cable. So, what are the major logistical issues keeping the space elevator from being anything more than a dream at present? Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics and astronautics Professor Jeff Hoffman said that designing the carbon nanotube appeared to be the biggest obstacle. \"We are now on the verge of having material that has the strength to span the 30,000 km ... but we don't have the ability to make long cable out of the carbon nanotubes at the moment.\" he said. \"Although I'm confident that within a reasonable amount of time we will be able to do this.\" Tsuchida said that one of the biggest challenges will be acquiring funding to move the projects forward. At present, there is no financial backing for the space elevator project, and all of the Japanese group's 100-plus members maintain other jobs to earn a living. \"Because we don't have a material which has enough strength to construct space elevator yet, it is difficult to change people's mind so they believe that it can be real,\" he said. Hoffman feels that international dialogue needs to be encouaraged on the issue. He said a number of legal considerations also would have to be taken into account. \"This is not something one nation or one company can do. There needs to be a worldwide approach,\" he said. Other difficulties for space-elevator projects include how to build the base for the elevator, how to design it and where to set up the operation. Tsuchida said some possible locations for an elevator include the South China Sea, western Australia and the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean. He said all of those locations usually avoided typhoons, which could pose a threat to the safety of an elevator. \"As the base of space elevator will be located on geosynchronous orbit, [the] space elevator ground station should be located near the equator,\" he said. Although the Japanese association has set a time frame of the 2030s to get a space elevator under construction -- and developments are moving quickly -- Hoffman acknowledges that it could be a little further away than that. \"I don't know if it's going to be in our lifetime or if it's 100 or 200 years away, but it's near enough that we can contemplate how it will work.\" Building a space elevator is a matter of when, not if, said Hoffman, who believes that it will herald a major new period in human history. \"It will be revolutionary for human technology, and not just for space travel. That's why so many people are pursuing it,\" he said. \"This is what it will take to turn humans into a space-bearing species.\"", "f0c30617317bcf73065f5b894558e101575f6e44": "(CNN) -- Barack Obama told supporters that \"change has come to America\" as he claimed victory in a historic presidential election.

The breakthrough allowed Claudia Castillo, 30, to receive a new section of trachea -- an airway essential for breathing -- without the risk that her body would reject the transplant. Castillo was given the stem cell surgery, the controversial branch of medicine that some say could lead to human cloning, after suffering a severe lung collapse. The condition, caused by long-term tuberculosis left Castillo, a Colombian now living in Barcelona, unable to carry out simple domestic duties or care for her two children. The only conventional option was a major operation to remove her left lung, a risky procedure with a high mortality rate. Sound off: What do you think about this medical breakthrough? A team from the universities of Barcelona, Spain; Bristol, England; and Padua and Milan, Italy, decided instead to replace Castillo's lower trachea and bronchial tube to her left lung with a lab-grown airway. The operation, reported Wednesday in the British medical journal The Lancet, has been hailed as a major leap for medicine that could offer new hope for patients suffering from serious illness. \"Surgeons can now start to see and understand the very real potential for adult stem cells and tissue engineering to radically improve their ability to treat patients with serious diseases,\" said Martin Birchall, professor of surgery at the University of Bristol, who was part of the team that did the operation. \"We believe this success has proved that we are on the verge of a new age in surgical care.\" To create the new windpipe, the team took a seven-centimeter (2.75-inch) segment of trachea from a 51-year-old who had died. Over a six-week period, the team then removed all the cells from the donor trachea, because those cells could lead to rejection of the organ after transplant. All that remained of the donor's stripped-down trachea was a matrix of collagen, a sort of scaffolding onto which the team then put Castillo's own stem cells -- along with cells taken from a healthy part of her trachea. Birchall had already taken Castillo's stem cells from her bone marrow and grown them into a large population in his Bristol lab.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain the procedure \u00bb . Four days after putting Castillo's stem cells into the donor trachea, the team was able to perform the transplant operation at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona. Castillo had no complications from the operation and was discharged from the hospital 10 days later. \"We are terribly excited by these results,\" said Paolo Macchiarini of the University of Barcelona, who performed the operation in June.  Watch Macchiarini describe the operation \u00bb . Macchiarini said just four days after the operation, the transplanted windpipe was \"almost indistinguishable\" from the patient's normal bronchi. After one month, he said, the blood vessels had successfully grown back. \"We think that this first experience represents a milestone in medicine and hope that it will unlock the door for a safe and recipient-tailored transplantation of the airway in adults and children,\" the authors said in their report. \"We hope that these future patients will no longer suffer the trauma of speech loss, severe shortness of breath and other limited clinical and social activities.\" The doctors said Castillo is now able to care for her children and enjoy a normal quality of life. She can walk up two flights of stairs and occasionally even go out dancing at night. In a comment accompanying the Lancet report, Toshihiko Sato and Tatsuo Nakamura of Kyoto University in Japan said the operation should be highly regarded, but follow-ups from longer evaluation periods are needed to better evaluate the results.", "4e2db22c67957a9eec3868fa6557120e27b1e4ea": "CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama told the nation Tuesday night that \"the dream of our founders is alive\" and that he's ready to fulfill his campaign mantra of bringing change to America. \"Change has come to America,\" President-elect Barack Obama told the nation on Tuesday night. \"At this defining moment, change has come to America,\" Obama, who will be the nation's first black president, told a crowd of about 125,000 people in Chicago's Grant Park.

Poland faces a struggle to upgrade many of its venues, such as Tenth Anniversary stadium in Warsaw. The decision to award the tournament to Poland -- a former communist country -- and Ukraine -- a former Soviet Republic -- was viewed with surprise by many in the world of sport as they had defeated a rival bid from established football powerhouse Italy. In addition to providing economic benefits -- hosting Euro 2008 was worth over $450 million to the Austrian economy according to its government -- staging such a high-profile international event would cap their remarkable transformation into credible democracies in the eyes of the world. However, both countries have had to address a number of problems.  Watch more about Poland's bid \u00bb . Political instability remains an issue in Ukraine -- the fragile ruling coalition recently collapsed -- while Poland's national team narrowly avoided a suspension after football's world ruling body FIFA said its federation had done little to stamp out corruption. A match-fixing scandal in the domestic league in 2005 led to about 70 people being arrested, though no one has been prosecuted. Significantly, neither country has hosted a major sporting event and concerns remain about the shortage of adequate stadiums, high-quality hotels and poor transport infrastructure in both Poland and Ukraine. With the proposed semi-final venues in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk and the Polish capital Warsaw, fans would currently be faced with a 30-hour train journey to attend both games. Although there are plans to expand and improve the highway linking the nations. The opening match is scheduled to be staged at a new 70,000-capacity National Stadium in Warsaw when construction work is completed in 2009 at a cost of $800 million. The final will be held at Kiev's redeveloped Olympic Stadium, however all 12 proposed venues need considerable work in order to comply with international standards. The remaining games will be held in the Polish cities of Gdansk, Poznan, Wroclaw, Chorzow and Krakow, as well as the Ukrainian cities of Lviv and Dnipropetrovsk. Concerns about the readiness of the co-hosts led to a warning in June this year from UEFA President Michel Platini that they risked losing the right to stage the tournament if stadiums in their capitals were not ready. This prompted a defiant response from the prime minister of Poland, who vowed to prove the skeptics wrong and make the 2012 European Championship an organizational triumph. \"We are aware that there are countries interested in us failing and the only successful rebuke to that will be better coordination and solidarity in our actions,\" Polish premier Donald Tusk told reporters at the time. Bizarrely, the head of Poland's Football Association, Michal Listkiewicz, offered Uefa an alternative option for 2012 after voicing his concerns about Poland's ability to overcome its transport issues. \"If the European Championships took place in 2016, we would have no problems about being ready then,\" Listkiewicz told Germany's Die Zeit Online. \"But realistically we are looking at having no good roads in time for 2012,\" he said. \"From Gdansk (in Poland) to Donetsk (in the Ukraine) is more than 1,500 kilometers (930 miles). This is not like in Austria and Switzerland where everything lies close together.\" Both countries were given a partial reprieve in September this year after UEFA's executive committee met in Bordeaux to discuss a progress report on preparations for the tournament. \"The executive committee reconfirmed UEFA's commitment to organize Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine,\" Platini told uefa.com. \"At the same time, the committee stressed a number of conditions must be met in order to bring forward the whole project.\" \"If we don't have the stadiums in Kiev and Warsaw, that's a problem. Ukraine can't afford to send everyone to a country where there is no capital city (ready),'' Platini said. \"They are working very hard and we have confidence in them. The president and the prime minister tell me it will be ready. What am I supposed to say? That I don't believe them?'' He added that the committee would review the progress again in May 2009. UEFA will then confirm the cities that will host matches. Meanwhile, the Scottish FA has offered to step in to host the tournament if UEFA decides to look elsewhere. Failure to host Euro 2012 is not an option in both Kiev and Warsaw. It would be viewed as a national embarrassment.", "8693bfc0ba4008ed54f1409a99b2fce60ea9e67b": "(CNN)  -- The cool of Barack Obama was very much on display on a warm day in Boston's Christopher Columbus Park during the summer of 2004. John Kerry, right, and Obama confer at the 2004 DNC, where Obama wowed the crowd with his keynote address. It was going to be a big day for the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate from Illinois. In a few hours, on that night, July 27, 2004, he was to give the keynote address to the Democratic National Convention at the Fleet Center about a mile away. But as he gave a lunchtime speech on environmental policy to a leisurely crowd of about 100 people at the green space on Boston Harbor, he was relaxed and loose, seemingly unconcerned about what was ahead. Taking notes amid the crowd, I hoped to get a few minutes with the candidate. I'd been told about his vaunted charisma -- my two brothers, both of whom live in Chicago, had mentioned his oratorical gifts -- but in person Obama seemed familiar, even a touch wonky, as he talked about asthma rates and the Bush administration's environmental record. I chatted with Obama's press attach\u00e9 and with a Chicago Tribune reporter, David Mendell, as the speech wound down, and was offered a ride in a nondescript minivan back to the Fleet Center. Even then Obama was attracting attention; several members of the audience gave him enthusiastic greetings as he left the scene to get in the van. In the front passenger seat of the van, the rail-thin Obama, obviously hungry (he later told me he'd lost eight pounds since the beginning of the campaign), chewed on a sandwich and joked with the other passengers as I peppered him with questions during the 20-minute ride. He answered with deliberate thoughtfulness, though he'd probably heard at least a few of them dozens of times already. Was he worried about the speech, the kind of spotlight that had made political leaders including William Jennings Bryan, Mario Cuomo and Ann Richards national figures? \"There's going to be some adrenaline,\" he said, after taking off his tie and unbuttoning his white dress shirt. \"But the pressure I'm experiencing is nothing compared to folks I'm meeting getting laid off. ... That's real pressure.\" And what about the Senate race? Illinois Republicans were in disarray and better-known, better-funded candidates had fallen by the wayside, with Obama seemingly now a sure thing for the seat. \"Three months is a lifetime in politics,\" Obama replied. By now, Obama's rise is well known: the son of a Kenyan father and Kansas mother, raised in Indonesia and Hawaii, community organizer, Harvard Law Review editor, author, law instructor, politician. He's been astutely revealing in his books, notably his 1995 memoir \"Dreams From My Father,\" and his presidential campaign has reflected his demeanor. But none of it was foreordained. In the fall of 2003, when he was still an Illinois state senator, he was one of seven candidates running for Peter Fitzgerald's vacated U.S. Senate seat. One of his opponents was a multimillionaire; another was the Illinois state controller. Obama was unknown and underfunded. \"I remember asking [at one event], 'Where is he?' \" Mendell recalled at the Boston rally. \"And somebody said, 'He's parking the car.' \" Mendell's description of Obama's 2004 race offers echoes of his painstaking, grassroots 2008 campaign. Obama had some good luck: The multimillionaire, Blair Hull, had details of his ugly divorce come out during the campaign. But Obama's success was also a tribute to his meticulous resolve. \"He ran a really smart primary campaign,\" Mendell said. \"He waited until the ninth inning to score all his runs. ... It was masterfully done.\" Mendell later wrote a book on Obama, \"Obama: From Promise to Power.\" Not even Obama knows for sure how he landed the keynote slot. In his 2006 book, \"The Audacity of Hope,\" he writes, \"The process by which I was selected ... remains something of a mystery to me.\" He didn't meet 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry until the Illinois primary was over, he recalls; he spoke at a Kerry fundraiser but didn't know he'd be giving a speech at the DNC until weeks later. Even then, he didn't know he'd deliver the keynote until told by Kerry campaign manager Mary Beth Cahill. According to an August article in The New Republic, Obama was selected over some better-known names by the Kerry brain trust, which included Cahill and adviser Robert Shrum, for various reasons. As an African-American, he would help attract minority voters; Obama was also youthful and energetic, qualities that the Kerry campaign wanted to display on television. And he had a good rapport with Kerry, Mendell told the magazine. \"It's Kerry kind of looking at him [at the fundraiser] and picking up tricks from the rookie,\" Mendell said. \"That was the event where he really impressed Kerry.\" The keynote, of course, electrified the nation and introduced America to the man who would become president. \"Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us,\" Obama said. \"Well, I say to them tonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America -- there's the United States of America. ... \"We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\" He gave a hint of those words in the van on the way to the Fleet Center. He was going to give a unifying message, he said, not one that reinforced the \"slash-and-burn politics\" that had divided the country. \"People know [President] Bush isn't the cause of every problem in the world, and they know the Democrats aren't a bunch of raving lunatics,\" he said. Having finished the sandwich, the van approaching its destination, and prepared to enter the Fleet Center for another round of interviews. When that was over, he was going to take a jog. \"Then a long shower,\" he added, \"and maybe a nap.\" History may have awaited, but he wasn't perturbed. Then again, maybe he knew something the rest of us didn't. He'd completed the speech a couple weeks earlier, and he must have suspected its power. In a New Yorker article by Ryan Lizza, Obama's friend Marty Nesbitt also recalls the buzz building around Obama that day, and a clue Obama gave as to what was next. \"My speech,\" Obama said, \"is pretty good.\"  Watch another 'pretty good' address: Obama's victory speech \u00bb .", "bb169fa70ad3afdc0ef848d29abd8832aaa5bc3b": "(CNN) -- Faced with a nationwide financial crisis, a volatile stock market and rising unemployment and inflation rates, many Americans are making changes in their personal spending habits.

An undated photo of the Sirius Star in South Korean waters. The Sirius Star -- a crude \"super tanker\" flagged in Liberia and owned by the Saudi Arabian-based Saudi Aramco company -- was attacked on Saturday more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya. The crew of 25, including British, Croatian, Polish, Filipino and Saudi nationals, are reported to be safe. U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet Cmdr. Jane Campbell said the super tanker weighs more than 300,000 metric tons and \"is more than three times the size of a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier.\" Oil industry insiders say a tanker of this size can carry up to 2 million barrels of oil, and the ship's operator, Dubai-based Vela International Marine Ltd, says it is fully laden. A U.S. Navy spokesman said the tanker is approaching Eyl, Somalia, on the Indian Ocean coast. It is routine procedure for pirates to take hijacked ships to shore, where they will keep them while they discuss negotiations. A multinational naval force including vessels from the U.S., the UK and Russia has been patrolling the Indian Ocean waters seas near the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, following a sharp increase in pirate attacks in the region. \"It was attacked more than 450 nautical offshore of Mombasa. This means that the pirates are now operating in an area of over 1.1 million square miles. This is a measure of the determination of the pirates and ... a measure of how lucrative piracy could become,\" Campbell said. Campbell said the Navy does not expect to dispatch a vessel to aide the super tanker because it does not have dangerous weapons aboard like the MV Faina, a Ukrainian ship loaded with arms that was seized by pirates on September 25. The UK Foreign Office confirmed two Britons were aboard and said it was seeking more information about the incident. South Korean officials said on Sunday that armed gunmen hijacked a Japanese freighter and its 23-member crew off the coast of Somalia. The hijacking came as the Korean government was considering sending a warship to join those of other countries to combat piracy in the area. A Russian patrol ship also thwarted an attack on a Saudi vessel. Eleven vessels are currently being held by pirates hoping to secure ransoms for their release, according to The Associated Press. They include the MV Faina, which was hijacked along with 20 crew and a cargo of weapons and T-72 tanks. Ninety percent of ships transiting the perilous seas are using a guarded corridor and there have been no hijackings inside the zone since it was set up on August 22, Danish Commodore Per Bigum Christensen told AP last week. Around 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year. \"Our presence in the region is helping deter and disrupt criminal attacks off the Somali coast, but the situation with the Sirius Star clearly indicates the pirates' ability to adapt their tactics and methods of attack\" said U.S. Vice Admiral Bill Gortney, commander of the Combined Maritime Forces. \"Piracy is an international crime that threatens global commerce. Shipping companies have to understand that naval forces can not be everywhere. Self protection measures are the best way to protect their vessels, their crews, and their cargo.\" CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report .", "80f91d738f559569782c0c1625b5b1342cf40dd7": "ST. LOUIS, Missouri (CNN) -- Ollie James is 84 years old and a doubter no more. Ollie James, 84, says he knows Obama is going to win, because he believes \"God answers prayers.\" \"I know he is going to win,\" James said after services at Leonard Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis. \"See, God answers prayers, and I am a praying man, and I know he is going to win.\" The \"he\" James is referring to is Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama. \"From where I came from, with the segregation and all the hatred, I never thought an African-American would get this far in the United States. Really.\" But three weeks until Election Day, James and many other African-Americans are now optimistic they will be part of history. \"I am kind of anticipating it will happen,\" said Raymond Henderson, a soft-spoken African-American man in his 60s. \"But no, I did not expect it to happen in my lifetime.\" It is the flip side of the \"race debate\" in Campaign 2008: While the Obama campaign and its Democratic allies are aggressively working to address the concerns of blue-collar and rural whites who are reluctant to support a black candidate for president, there is an enthusiasm in the African-American community that Democrats believe could lead to dramatically increased turnout and perhaps tip the scales in several key battlegrounds, Missouri among them. African-Americans cast 10 percent of the ballots for president in 2000 and about 12 percent in 2004. Obama aides believe if that percentage increased just modestly in 2008, it could make the difference in at least a half-dozen states: Missouri, Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Wisconsin and Nevada are additional battlegrounds where Obama organizers are counting on an increase in African-American turnout in their Election Day game plan. To reach its goal, the campaign is counting on a combination of newly registered African-Americans and aggressive outreach to tens of thousands black voters who are registered to vote but have stayed home in past elections.  See why African-Americans are finding hope in Obama \u00bb . At Leonard Missionary Baptist, the Rev. Steven Thompson is careful not to preach from the pulpit: He exhorts his congregants to vote but does not preach in favor of or against any specific candidate. Still, a visit to his services found an overwhelmingly pro-Obama crowd, and Thompson says the enthusiasm level about this election is unprecedented in his two decades as the inner-city church's pastor. \"The energy comes from the fact that it is historical, and we've got a lot of first-time voters and many like myself who have been through a few, and it still has that pumped up energy in it,\" Thompson said. Increased African-American turnout is all the more important because of Obama's tougher challenge in more conservative, rural areas. In the Missouri Ozarks, a roadside billboard shows a cartoon of Obama with a turban, his middle name \"Hussein\" in bold red letters. \"Hmmmm,\" Thompson said when shown a photograph of the billboard, keeping his trademark calm. \"If I spent my time getting angry about the things people do, then I can't do what I effectively do here,\" Thompson said as he gestured toward the pulpit. \"Those people who do stuff like that, the only thing I can say is, we pray for them.\" Fredrick Lemon II says that for months, he doubted that Obama could win, but now he believes he can. Still, Lemon took time after services to compliment Republican nominee John McCain for trying to calm angry supporters at recent rallies, including a woman last week who incorrectly said she was worried about an Obama presidency because he is Arab. \"It has gotten a little nasty,\" Lemon said. \"But I think that John McCain really showed some integrity and some character when he was at the last town hall meeting and some people said some disparaging remarks and he corrected them.

Leigh on screenwriting: \"I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process.\" In that time, he has been nominated for five Oscars, as well as winning the Best Director award at Cannes Film Festival for \"Naked\" in 1993, the Palme d'Or there for \"Secrets & Lies\" in 1996 and the Leono d'Oro at Venice Film Festival in 2004 for \"Vera Drake.\" Famous for his fierce independence (read refusal to work in Hollywood), Leigh's work is known for gritty realism and a focus on underprivileged sections of British society. Another of Leigh's calling cards is an unconventional approach to screenwriting. \"The Screening Room\" caught up with the veteran director at the International Screenwriters' Festival in the UK earlier this year to ask him more about his approach to making films. The Screening Room: Why is this festival so important to you? Mike Leigh: I am a filmmaker who is both a writer and director and I have this way of making films where the writing and the actors and the shooting is all combined together. I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process. TSR: What do you think other scriptwriters can learn from you? ML: I think screenwriters who, because of the politics and economics of the film industry, are forced to work in a much more conventional way, are always fascinated to discuss with me how I work. TSR: There is this romantic idea that screenwriting has to be a painful, solitary experience. That's not what you experience, though. ML: No, I don't sit in a room writing a script solo. My films are highly structured. Everything you see in my films is very precisely written, very thoroughly researched, but actually it is done through rehearsal, it's done through improvisation and research. I work for six months with the actors before we shoot anything, then the shooting of the film is in itself then an operation of making the film as I go along in a way, although it's very structured. It's a very sophisticated thing. TSR: How did you first discover that this way the way you wanted to make your films? ML: I trained as an actor, I did a lot of theatre work and, of course, the convention of actually rehearsing is much more prevalent in the theater, although actually what I do isn't really theater practice, it's very film orientated in its nature but it came out of all of those kind of explorations and experiences in the 1960s. TSR: How important is the audition process for you? ML: For me, casting is probably more important than it is for most people. If someone has written a conventional script then a range of actors could do that role. I find actors with whom I can collaborate to create characters, so I have to have actors that are brilliant, who are very intelligent and not all actors are very intelligent, who are versatile, who are character actors and not all actors are, that have a sense of humor, that have a sense of society and commitment, who aren't just narcissistic which a lot of actors are, and people who are patient and courageous. Working with me on these things is dangerous. TSR: When you work with actors do you give them over to the idea that they are shaping the story, or do you always know exactly what you want? ML: I don't always have a structure, and certainly there is no illusion involved. Also, I say to each actor when asking him or her to take part, you will only ever know what your character knows, so they never have an overview of the film. Their actual contribution is as an individual with a responsibility to their character, but my job is to tell the story. It's a very healthy and harmonious division of labor, but certainly, there would be no point in doing it if I didn't set up conditions in which they can really explore and the thing can go in fantastically unpredictable directions. TSR: When you take a script to a producer, how much should you compromise to get the film made? ML: I am the least qualified person in the world to answer that because I don't do that in the first place. I mean, I go to backers with my producers and we say, \"I can't tell you anything about it. I haven't got the script. Give us the money and we will go away and make it.\" And they either say 'yes,' which happens just occasionally, or they say 'no' which happens most of the time. So, I never have a situation where anybody interferes or where I have to compromise. But just in passing I would say that I have a rule about what one should do in the film business which is never compromise.", "cf7c301f613ab00d6e07dd222ab9243ef3d272a6": "MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- One of Osama bin Laden's sons has been denied asylum in Spain, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman told CNN on Wednesday. Omar bin Laden pictured earlier this year during a television interview in Rome, Italy. Omar bin Laden, who is in his late 20s, stepped off a plane at Madrid's Barajas International Airport during a stopover late Monday and informed authorities that he planned to request political asylum, the spokeswoman said. Bin Laden has publicly called on his father to abandon terrorism. He prepared his formal asylum request Tuesday at the airport with the help of a translator, filing it around 1 p.m., the spokeswoman said. The Interior Ministry, which had 72 hours to reply to the request, was required to seek the opinion of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on the matter. The UNHCR recommended against granting asylum, the spokeswoman said Wednesday. No reason was given for the denial. It was not immediately known what grounds bin Laden gave for his request, and the spokeswoman said it is unlikely to be disclosed. His flight Monday originated in Cairo, Egypt, and landed in Madrid on its way to Casablanca, Morocco, she said. The request caught Spanish authorities by surprise, she said. Bin Laden, who is married to a British citizen, previously was denied asylum in Britain. He holds a Saudi passport. Since Spain has denied his request, bin Laden has 24 hours to appeal before he is put on a plane back to Cairo, the spokeswoman said. If he appeals, the Spanish government has 48 hours to rule on it. Last year, 7,664 people requested asylum in Spain. The government granted that status to only 570, the spokeswoman said.

Vladimir Putin was barred constitutionally from seeking a third consecutive term as president. There is widespread speculation in Russian media that the change is aimed at paving the way for a return to the Kremlin by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who remains a popular and powerful figure since leaving the president's office in May. The Kremlin maintains the amendment -- along with other proposed changes to the terms in office for elected officials -- is necessary to ensure the stability of future Russian governments. President Dmitry Medvedev announced the measures just two weeks ago, in his first state-of-the-nation speech on November 5. The lower house of the Russian parliament had its third and final reading Friday before putting the measures to a vote. It passed by a vote of 392 to 57, with those against representing the Communist Party faction. There were no abstentions. Further approval is needed from the upper house of parliament and regional councils before the changes become law. The amendments will come into force when at least two-thirds of the nation's 83 regional parliaments and assemblies -- or 56 -- approve them. Analysts have expressed concern about the rapid movement of the measures through parliament. They say the government may be seeking to capitalize on Putin's popularity amid the financial crisis, which has dented support for the current leadership. The next Russian presidential elections are scheduled for 2012. There is speculation in Russia that the new measures could set the stage for fresh elections, allowing Putin to sidestep a ban on a third presidential term and stand again for president. -- CNN's Matthew Chance and Max Tkachenko contributed to this report.", "89dbc8653124d5caf46c516422c988a1074ac409": "TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Japanese scientists have produced clones of mice that have been dead and frozen for 16 years -- a feat that could lead researchers to one day resurrect long-extinct species, such as the mammoth. Dolly was cloned using cells from live animals. Now scientists believe they can resurrect extinct species. Until now, scientists have only been able to produce clones using cells from live animals. This is how researchers created Dolly the Sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult animal. Researchers had thought that frozen cells were unusable because ice crystals would have damaged the DNA. That belief would rule out the possibility of resurrecting extinct animals from their frozen remains.

Instead, he heads to Fort Bliss, Texas, this weekend, where his National Guard unit completes assigned tasks and receives additional training specific to the conditions in Iraq. Then, in six to eight weeks, they ship out to Iraq. Despite increased interest and security because Biden is now a vice presidential nominee, the public affairs officer for the unit had insisted the ceremony would be no different, and not political. Lt. Col. Len Grattieri said Wednesday that the last time Biden -- who has often spoken at deployment ceremonies -- addressed a departing unit was 18 months ago, and that he usually roots his remarks in foreign policy, offering his perspective on the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Grattieri couldn't say where Beau Biden will be based, but his role will be that of a prosecutor enforcing the Uniform Code of Military Justice. He added that positions aren't clearly defined, and the unit will do whatever the Army needs it to. In the past week, Biden had been trying to balance debate prep with family time. On Tuesday afternoon, he took a break and went out to lunch with Beau, Beau's wife, Hallie, and the couple's young daughter. Aides say it's been a tough week for Biden, with Beau's departure weighing on him. Biden said in an interview Tuesday that he is proud of his son, but wishes he weren't going. Palin, along with Biden, brought up their respective sons' deployment to Iraq during the debate. Palin's son Track, 19, an infantry soldier, was deployed to Iraq with his Army unit September 11. Palin spoke at her eldest son's deployment ceremony in Alaska, which honored the 4,000 Alaska-based troops to be deployed from Fort Wainwright to Iraq in the coming weeks. Track Palin, who was standing in formation among members of the 1st Stryker Brigade's 25th Infantry Division at Fort Wainwright, went unmentioned by the governor in her brief remarks. Palin had agreed to speak at the deployment ceremony several months ago, before she was tapped as Sen. John McCain's running mate. Though the speech wasn't a political event -- media credentials were issued by the military base -- that didn't stop dozens of national reporters and photographers from descending on the military base in Fairbanks, home to nearly 12,000 soldiers and their families. \"As you depart today,\" Palin told the infantrymen, \"don't mind us -- your parents, your friends, your family -- if we allow for a few tears, or if we hold you just a little close once more before you're gone. Because were going to miss you. We can't help it. We are going to miss you.\" Palin said victory in Iraq is \"within sight.\" \"You and others like you will be there to see the mission through,\" she said. \"You will be there to win. You will see victory. Track Palin signed up to join the Army on September 11, 2007. During his 12-month deployment, his unit will protect reconstruction teams that are rebuilding the country, said Maj. Chris Hyde, the public affairs officer for the brigade. Hyde, who called Track Palin \"a low-profile individual,\" said he had not heard any security concerns about having the son of a prominent political figure in the brigade. \"The decision to put him in that role was made before Gov. Palin was picked by McCain,\" he said. \"If anything comes down from headquarters, we will comply, but I wouldn't even want to speculate. I wouldn't say yes or no. That's just my opinion. We will do well with Track Palin whether he's there or he's not.\" CNN's Peter Hamby, Ed Hornick and Alexander Marquardt contributed to this report.", "657fa93300b4793a72c39a7a3fb22d25640e5b99": "CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Barack Obama did more than thump John McCain in the Electoral College tally; he also handily won the popular vote and redrew the great divide between red states and blue states. Barack Obama addresses a crowd of more than 200,000 at Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois. Riding a Democratic tide that bolstered the party's presence in both houses of Congress, Obama snared about 63 million votes to McCain's 55.8 million, according to totals early Wednesday. According to exit polls, Obama crushed McCain among women voters (56 percent to 43 percent); voters under 30 (66 percent to 32 percent); African-American voters (95 percent to 4 percent); Latino voters (66 percent to 32 percent); first-time voters (68 percent to 31 percent); and voters making less than $100,000 a year (55 percent to 43 percent). \"I think this is the passing of an old order,\" CNN senior political analyst David Gergen said as the results rolled in Tuesday night and the outcome became increasingly evident.

Obama then delivered an uppercut in Virginia, a state that had not voted for a Democratic president since 1964. See your state's county-by-county totals . As polls closed from East to West, Obama kept hammering McCain, as he snatched away Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada -- states that had been in President Bush's column in 2004. And Wednesday morning, Obama added Indiana to the list of states he'd turned from red to blue. Indiana hadn't voted for a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. (Missouri and North Carolina were still counting votes Wednesday, but it appeared one or two of them could become blue-state converts as well.) With McCain on the ropes, an Obama victory in Florida sounded the death knell.  What's next for Illinois and Delaware? \u00bb . When Indiana fell into Obama's column Wednesday morning, he had a 349-163 lead over his rival in electoral votes, with only 26 undecided.

We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America -- I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you -- we as a people will get there,\" Obama said in Chicago before an estimated crowd of up to 240,000 people.

He will be sworn in as the 44th president on January 20.", "ff45206cfab4cea277d8dbbf002b3bb312af076d": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- John McCain's fight for the White House was a microcosm of his political career and broader life -- full of near-death experiences, stunning comebacks and close calls. Sen. John McCain gestures as he delivers his concession speech Tuesday night. The former Navy fighter pilot, who'd been shot down over North Vietnam and held as a POW, had been able to battle back every time until Tuesday night. He regained respect in the Senate after being accused of improperly helping fraudster savings and loan chief Charles Keating in the 1980s; he got back on speaking terms with the Republican Party base after his primary defeat against George W. Bush in 2000; and he revitalized his campaign after its near-death last summer from lack of cash and power struggles to capture the nomination. What would have been his greatest political comeback -- to seize the White House -- proved to be too difficult. A Republican win in what is being seen as a \"Democratic year\" was always a long shot. Whoever was the GOP nominee was going to have to fight against the legacy of the previous eight years of a Republican president who became highly unpopular because of the Iraq war, administration gaffes such as the handling of Hurricane Katrina, and what turned from a credit crunch into a global economic crisis. The Arizona senator even managed to make the race appear competitive, soaring in the polls on the back of a polished convention and popular VP pick, Gov. Sarah Palin. But he made mistakes, too. Combined with the electorate's disenchantment with his party, it ensured defeat. Turning points . New Hampshire: McCain's great high point came in January, amid the snows of New Hampshire, when primary voters boosted him from long shot to top-tier candidate, just as they had eight years earlier. He stunned a crowded GOP field -- including Mitt Romney, the well-funded former governor of neighboring Massachusetts, and Iowa caucus winner Mike Huckabee -- and proved himself a force to be reckoned with. Not Hillary: Democrats weren't the only ones who expected Hillary Clinton to put a quick end to the primary season -- the Republican machine had spent years honing plans to fight the New York senator in a general election. Not only were those plans ruined, but suddenly the challenger was a fresh face with little baggage who captured the public's imagination. And as the epic Democratic primary season gave many headlines to Barack Obama, it also helped him develop networks of supporters in traditionally red states. And millions of new Obama supporters also became donors, financing a record-breaking fundraising effort. George W. Bush: McCain may never have been a great friend of the president, but he could hardly turn down an endorsement from him at the White House. It was a photo-op that launched a thousand attack ads. Even if the unpopular president was a virtual no-show on the campaign trail, it was easy for the Democrats to remind voters who McCain's party colleague was. Straight talk: One of McCain's strengths had been his relationship with news groups, gaining appreciation by answering reporters' questions until there were none left. But when asked whether he agreed with campaign supporter Carly Fiorina that health insurance plans that covered Viagra should cover birth control as well, he had no answer. Cameras rolled on his Straight Talk Express campaign bus as he sat silently, looking awkward -- long moments of video that would be replayed again and again. Virtually overnight, news conferences disappeared from McCain's agenda as advisers who believed that an open-door media policy did not help persuaded their man they were right. McCain was left to repeat the rehearsed lines of his stump speech, losing the opportunity to impress in candid moments and his likability numbers began to slip. VP pick: McCain made his \"Hail Mary\" pick -- privately acknowledged by some advisers as his only shot of winning -- with the governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. For a few weeks, it looked like that game-winning touchdown could happen as the base-rousing running mate burst onto the national scene with such power that the GOP ticket took the lead in major opinion polls. But inconvenient investigations, unfortunate interview performances and questions about qualifications soon hit Palin's approval ratings. McCain's own reputation was tarnished as revelations about hasty vetting raised questions in voters' minds about his judgment. And by then, his central argument against Obama -- that experience was critical -- was essentially off the table given Palin's relatively thin resume. Meltdown response: Ask Republican insiders when they knew the fight was lost, and most will point to McCain's decision to halt campaigning as the depth of the financial crisis became apparent. The rise of the economy from a key election issue to the only issue was never going to help the candidate who'd said earlier it was not his strong suit. But his bid to get in front with a dramatic departure from the campaign trail backfired. He became a bit player at best, again raising the question of leadership ability and judgment and coming up wanting against his opponent. John McCain was never assured victory. But nor was defeat guaranteed. Some of his toughest breaks were outside of his control; other wounds were self-inflicted. Maybe -- given personality, politics and circumstance -- he could not have made decisions other than the ones he chose. But those choices helped seal his loss.

Some Democratic presidential candidates pose before a debate sponsored by Univision. The Republican debate was postponed after only one candidate agreed to attend, a development which troubled some party leaders. The Hispanic vote is neither homogenous nor loyal to one party. Though the current political moment seems to favor the Democratic Party, experts say that affinity should not be taken for granted. The Hispanic community is the fastest-growing minority group in the United States, according to the U.S. census. But its percentage of the electorate is lower than its numbers as a whole because of lower citizenship rates, less voter participation and a youthful demographic. Of the nation's more than 44 million people of Hispanic origin, about a third are too young to vote. But all that's changing. Before the midterm elections in 2006, the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington-based think-tank, estimated more than 17 million Hispanics would be eligible to vote in that election. The number represented a 7 percent increase from 2004. The Hispanic share of the U.S. electorate increased from 8.2 percent to 8.6 percent during the same period, Pew estimated. That percentage may grow even more by 2008 as a result of citizenship drives, get-out-the-vote campaigns and the natural growth of the community. Univision, the Spanish-language broadcast giant, has thrown its considerable weight behind a citizenship drive this year. \"We feel that empowering our audience is good for Hispanics and the country,\" Univision President Ray Rodriguez told the Wall Street Journal in May 2007, adding that it was \"a totally nonpartisan effort.\" Organizations such as the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, or NALEO, are also mobilizing the vote. \"We have spearheaded a massive naturalization campaign and close to, I think, a million applications will have been submitted this fiscal year,\" said NALEO's executive director, Arturo Vargas. The change in the electorate could play a significant role in possible swing states like Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado and Florida during the 2008 election. There's a reason the Democratic Party decided to hold its presidential convention in Denver, experts said. \"I don't think it's really registered with people just how influential the Latino vote can be in some of these state primaries,\" Vargas said. The Hispanic vote has historically been aligned with the Democratic Party, an allegiance established during the administrations of Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, said Harry Pachon of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute. That political alignment was further cemented when Proposition 187 -- designed to deny health care, education and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants -- was pushed by Republicans and passed in California in 1994. But the Republican Party, intent on gaining more Hispanic voters, made inroads during the early parts of this decade, culminating in the 2004 presidential campaign by President Bush. Exit polls showed he carried 40 to 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. \"There are a lot of issues that Latinos agree with Republican philosophy,\" Pachon said, pointing to the GOP stances on entrepreneurship, fiscal policies, its appeal to Hispanic evangelicals and its policies toward Cuba. But the heated immigration debate, when many congressional Republicans disagreed with President Bush over granting a path toward citizenship for many illegal immigrants, may erode those gains. \"The Republicans are really caught between a rock and a hard place,\" Pachon said. They must balance the interests of a segment of their constituency that is very anti-immigrant with the interests of a \"Latino voter that is affluent and middle class, who can theoretically be reached by Republican Party principles,\" he said. It is little wonder then, that among Republican presidential candidates, only Arizona Sen. John McCain agreed to appear at an Univision debate scheduled for mid-September. The debate didn't happen. All but one of the Democratic contenders appeared for their debate. Some Republican leaders said last week not participating in such debates could harm the party's standing with minority groups for the 2008 election and beyond. \"What are we going to do -- meet in a country club in the suburbs one day?\" former congressman and GOP vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp told The Washington Post. \"If we're going to be competitive with people of color, we've got to ask them for their vote.\" \"This [political environment] gives Democrats a huge advantage,\" Adam J. Segal, who heads the Hispanic Voter Project at Johns Hopkins University, said in an e-mail. He also runs the 2050 Group, a multicultural public relations firm based in Washington. \"They are likely to draw far more Hispanic votes than in 2004 and would gain at least a half-million vote advantage\" under one of his group's more conservative scenarios, Segal said. But the Hispanic community is diverse and voting interests are not homogenous, which imperils such predictions. Hispanic immigrants originate from more than a dozen different countries, arrived in the U.S. through numerous immigration waves and have different perceptions of communal identity, Segal said. For example, a Cuban-American may vote Republican because of the GOP's long-standing policies toward Cuba, whereas a Puerto Rican voter in New York City or a voter in a border state may be driven by different motives. The culture of a state can also affect a Hispanic voter's behavior. A voter in Texas may be more conservative, whereas a voter with a similar background in California may be more liberal, Pachon said. There may also be generational cleavages, Pachon said. A study he conducted with a colleague on the impact of religion on the Latino vote revealed differences between first-, second- and third-generation Hispanics. The first and third generations said religion was more important to them when compared to the second generation. Additionally, despite the furor over immigration, that issue might not be the most important to Hispanic voters, NALEO's Vargas said. \"If the election were held today, I think immigration would be a significant factor, but we're more than a year away from the election,\" he said. Based on a series of town hall meetings conducted in 2004 and conversations throughout this year, Vargas said education, the Iraq war, the economy and health care may take precedence over immigration. \"We need to distinguish issues that matter to the Latino community versus the issues that matter to Latino voters,\" he said. \"Those are not the same.\" E-mail to a friend .", "42a7334ee9360b833b9c331f56783d1f4ff6c990": "BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN)  -- Colombian President Alvaro Uribe enjoys one of the highest popularity ratings of any leader in South America, so much that his supporters are pushing for a third presidential term for him. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe has not said whether he would be willing to run for a third term. But the constitution would have to be changed to allow that, and recent global issues have even some supporters questioning whether Uribe should be allowed to seek that extra time in office. \"When the president was first re-elected in 2006, the economy was thriving, and the president benefited from its success,\" said Carlos Lemoine, a political consultant. \"Now, the economy is in a very different situation.\" Five million Colombians might disagree. They have signed petitions asking for a constitutional referendum that would grant Uribe the chance to run again. That could happen in 2010 or, if he sat out a term, in 2014. The nation's Congress is debating the referendum, and not all lawmakers are convinced it's a good idea. \"Another re-election is not good for Colombia, because it would concentrate the power of government on the president,\" said David Luna, a member of Colombia's Chamber of Representatives, the lower house of Congress. Added representative German Olano, \"In 2001, voters agreed Alvaro Uribe was the most qualified person for the job. But, like any other democracy, there are plenty of capable people for the job. And those people should get their chance.\" The third-term argument in Colombia mirrors to a large degree the situation in rival Venezuela, where President Hugo Chavez announced last month that he will press for a constitutional amendment to enable him to seek re-election in order to govern until 2021. Observers say the efforts to expand presidential terms reflect a historical shift in South America. \"Historically, those countries did not have re-election. The president could serve one term, and that was it,\" said Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs, an independent research and information organization. \"There would be military coups, with the military ousting one civilian ruler to put in another civilian ruler. Then in the 1970s, the coups changed. The military seized power and held it and didn't turn authority over to civilians. So one country after another revised their constitutions to allow standing for re-election,\" Birns said. \"We now have a situation where ruling parties want to stay in power, but for different reasons. In the case of Colombia and Uribe, it is law and order. For Chavez in Venezuela, it is extending his vision, getting more time to institutionalize that vision,\" Birns said. In Colombia, there is also talk of \"vision\" among congressional supporters of a third term for Uribe. \"I believe President Uribe's success requires us to consider the [constitutional] referendum and grant it, so that we can continue his vision of long-term stability,\" Chamber of Representatives member Nicolas Uribe said. But former Colombian President Andres Pastrana believes that it is time for a change, and changing the constitution to allow for a third term is not the change he means. \"I think that changing the constitution for someone's personal gain is against our democratic principles, and it would be a grave mistake for this country,\" he said. That is a risk that supporters of the referendum are willing to take. \"It is not going to weaken our democracy,\" supporter Luis Guillermo Giraldo said. \"Just look at Margaret Thatcher, who governed for 11 years, or Tony Blair for 10,\" he said, referring to two former British prime ministers. As the debate goes on in Colombia, Uribe is not saying whether he wants another term in office. And opponents are arguing that it would not be worth spending an estimated $57 million on a referendum to find out whether he should even be allowed to be a candidate.", "56512d980e6f0b9da641f67293af0ade8486a88f": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Crichton, who helped create the TV show \"ER\" and wrote the best-sellers \"Jurassic Park,\" \"The Andromeda Strain,\" \"Sphere\" and \"Rising Sun,\" has died in Los Angeles, his public relations firm said in a news release. Michael Crichton, here in 2005, was a director and best-selling author. He co-created the TV series \"ER.\" Crichton died unexpectedly Tuesday \"after a courageous and private battle against cancer,\" the release said. He was 66. Crichton, a medical doctor, was attracted to cautionary science tales.  Watch more about the life of Crichton \u00bb . \"Jurassic Park\" -- perhaps his best-known work -- concerned capturing the DNA of dinosaurs and bringing them to life on a modern island, where they soon run amok; \"The Andromeda Strain,\" his first major fiction success, involves an alien microorganism that's studied in a special military compound after causing death in a nearby community. Crichton also invited controversy with some of his scientific views. He was an avowed skeptic of global climate change, giving lectures warning against \"consensus science.\" He later took on global warming and the theories surrounding it in his 2004 novel, \"State of Fear,\" which attracted attacks in its own right from scientists, including NASA climatologist James Hansen. iReport.com: Were you a fan? Share your tributes. Crichton was a distinctive figure in the entertainment business, a trained physician whose interests included writing, filmmaking and television. (He was physically distinctive as well, standing 6 feet 9 inches.) He published \"The Andromeda Strain\" while he was still a medical student at Harvard Medical School. He wrote a story about a 19th-century train robbery, called \"The Great Train Robbery,\" and then directed the 1979 film version. He also directed several other films, including \"Westworld\" (1973), \"Coma\" (1978), \"Looker\" (1981) and \"Runaway\" (1984). In 1993, while working on the film version of \"Jurassic Park\" with Steven Spielberg, he teamed with the director to create \"ER.\" The NBC series set in a Chicago emergency room debuted in 1994 and became a huge hit, making a star of George Clooney. Crichton originally wrote the script for the pilot in 1974. \"Michael's talent out-scaled even his own dinosaurs of 'Jurassic Park,' \" said Spielberg, a friend of Crichton's for 40 years, according to The Associated Press. \"He was the greatest at blending science with big theatrical concepts, which is what gave credibility to dinosaurs again walking the Earth. ... Michael was a gentle soul who reserved his flamboyant side for his novels. There is no one in the wings that will ever take his place.\" Crichton was \"an extraordinary man. Brilliant, funny, erudite, gracious, exceptionally inquisitive and always thoughtful,\" \"ER\" executive producer John Wells told the AP. \"No lunch with Michael lasted less than three hours and no subject was too prosaic or obscure to attract his interest. Sexual politics, medical and scientific ethics, anthropology, archaeology, economics, astronomy, astrology, quantum physics, and molecular biology were all regular topics of conversation.\" Michael Crichton was born in Chicago in 1942 and grew up in New York's suburbs. His father was a journalist and Michael loved the writing profession. He went to medical school partly out of a concern he wouldn't be able to make writing a career, but the success of \"The Andromeda Strain\" in 1969 -- the book was chosen by the Book-of-the-Month Club and optioned by Hollywood -- made him change his mind, though he still had an M.D. Though most of Crichton's books were major best-sellers involving science, he could ruffle feathers when he took on social issues. \"Rising Sun\" (1992) came out during a time when Americans feared Japanese ascendance, particularly when it came to technology. \"Disclosure\" (1994) was about a sexual harassment case. iReport.com: How did Crichton's work affect you?

Crichton won an Emmy, a Peabody, a Writers Guild of America Award for \"ER,\" and won other awards as well. \"Through his books, Michael Crichton served as an inspiration to students of all ages, challenged scientists in many fields, and illuminated the mysteries of the world in a way we could all understand,\" the news release said. Crichton was married five times and had one child.

NATO soldiers sit in their vehicle in an Afghan province freed from Taliban forces. Afghan civilian deaths jumped from 430 in the first six months of 2007 to 698 so far this year, an increase of 60 percent, said John Holmes, the United Nations undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs. \"It is clear that the international military forces are making every effort to minimize civilian casualties,\" Holmes said. \"Nevertheless, these problems are still there, and we need to deal with them and make sure that the safety of civilians comes first and international humanitarian law is respected,\" he said. Taliban insurgents forces have shifted from direct attacks on international troops toward the use of \"civilian-blind\" measures such as roadside bombings and suicide attacks, said Aleem Siddique, a spokesman for the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. At the same time, he said, civilian deaths blamed on government forces and U.S. and NATO troops has declined in the first six months of 2008, largely due to pressure from Afghan President Hamid Karzai. About 60 percent of civilian deaths in 2008 are blamed on anti-government forces, up from less than half in 2007. Increased Taliban attacks on aid projects also have left 78 of Afghanistan's 398 districts off-limits to relief workers, Siddique said. \"Increasingly, we're seeing targets of schools, of radio stations, of health clinics -- all in an effort to halt progress and keep people in fear,\" he said. A total of 565 aid convoys came under attack in 2007, with hundreds of tons of food hijacked. As recently as Sunday, a convoy of 100 tons of food aid came under attack outside Kandahar, with several trucks burned and looted, he said. \"Thankfully, we're not getting any report of death or injuries,\" he said. Afghanistan is the original front in the \"war on terrorism,\" which was launched after al Qaeda's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. A U.S.-led invasion after the attacks pushed out the Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but the Islamic fundamentalist militia has regrouped along and across the mountainous border with Pakistan. Coinciding with the rise in civilian deaths in 2008 is an increase in attacks on American and allied forces, which are up 40 percent since last year . The death toll of U.S. and allied troops in Afghanistan in June also climbed to more than 40, making it the deadliest month since the war began. An explosion in southern Afghanistan killed a British soldier serving with NATO on Saturday, the British Defense Ministry said Sunday. The soldier died when he was struck by a mine in Lashkar Gah, the capital city of Helmand province, the ministry said. He and his unit were investigating a report of a rocket-propelled grenade attack on a civilian aircraft at a nearby airfield, it said. \"When investigating this, they dismounted their vehicles and what is believed to have been a legacy anti-Personnel mine detonated, killing the soldier instantly,\" the ministry statement said. Most of the soldiers serving in Helmand are British. Helmand province is Afghanistan's top poppy-producing region and a major front in the war against the Taliban. Provincial authorities there have blamed militants for a spate of recent deadly attacks. NATO and Afghan force operations kept the insurgency down in 2007 by killing or capturing key leaders and clearing out Taliban safe havens, but a Pentagon report issued last week predicted the Taliban would be back in 2008.", "5bdc149939290629bcf86aa6e414543bda79e01b": "MEXICO CITY (CNN) -- The death toll in a plane crash that claimed the life of Mexico's interior minister and two other high-ranking officials has risen to 13, Mexico City prosecutor Miguel Angel Mancera said Wednesday, according to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. The scene of Tuesday night's plane crash in Mexico City was one of panic and confusion, a witness says. The small plane carrying Interior Minister Juan Camilo Mourino and seven others crashed in central Mexico City on Tuesday night. A witness described \"moments of panic and confusion\" after the crash, as burning people asked for help and others ran from the scene. The crash injured 40 people on the ground, said government spokesman Marcelo Ebrard. All eight passengers and crew on board the plane were killed, the spokesman said. Two of the dead are women, Mancera said. Also among the dead were Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos, a former deputy attorney general, and Miguel Monterubio Cubas, the director of social communication, President Felipe Calderon said in a televised address Tuesday night. In Mexico, the minister of the interior oversees domestic affairs, particularly national security, law enforcement and the war on drugs. It is Mexico's second-most-powerful post. Vasconcelos was one of Mexico's top experts on the fight against narcotraffickers and was said to have a price on his head. \"I want to express my deepest condolences to the families of the victims and my absolute support during this difficult time,\" Calderon said. Mourino, he said, \"was one of my closest colleagues and one of my best friends. ... With his death, Mexico loses a great Mexican.\" At least 12 cars were burned and two buildings were damaged, Notimex said.  Watch video footage of the aftermath of the crash \u00bb . No cause for the crash was immediately given, but Calderon assured the nation that the results of the investigation will be made public. The Learjet 45 did not explode in the air, said Luis Tellez, secretary of communication and transportation. When there is an explosion in the air, Tellez said at a news conference Wednesday, pieces of the airplane are scattered over a wide area. But the wreckage in this instance was limited to a small area, he said. Tellez said Wednesday the pilot did not report an emergency, Notimex said. An audio recording released Wednesday of what Mexican officials said was dialogue between the pilot and the airport control tower did not appear to have an emergency call from the aircraft. The recording could be linked to off the Notimex Web site. The plane was traveling from the north-central city of San Luis Potosi to Mexico City, Calderon said. The cities are about 220 miles (355 km) apart. The Learjet was built in 1998 and carried identification call letters of XCVMC, Tellez said. Agustin Arellano, director of the federal agency that oversees Mexican airspace, said the aircraft's flight path, altitude and velocity were within accepted standards for a landing at Mexico City's Benito Juarez International Airport. The information was retrieved from the airplane's flight data recorder, Arellano said at the news conference with Tellez. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it has sent a team of investigators, led by senior aviation accident investigator Joe Sedora. The team includes technical advisers from the NTSB, the Federal Aviation Administration, Learjet and Honeywell International, it said. Mourino had just given a speech in San Luis Potosi, detailing the administration's efforts to combat drug traffickers, kidnappers and other criminals. When Calderon took office in December 2006, Mourino said, the new president focused on combating crime. \"It was decided to combat criminal groups with all available power in order to confront them, to reduce them and to fulfill the essential mandate of all authority, which is none other than to guarantee peace, tranquility and security for its citizens,\" Mourino said in his speech. Calderon has unleashed federal police and soldiers in several states across Mexico and tightened controls on money laundering and corruption among local and municipal police forces, which have been infiltrated by drug traffickers. The effort has resulted in widespread carnage, with more than 3,000 deaths this year. At the scene of Tuesday's crash, taxi driver Raymundo Bernal, 28, told Notimex that he witnessed the event. \"I heard a strong roar and then saw four people who were burning and asking for help while the rest ran and the tops of trees were burning,\" he said. \"The ambulances took 10 minutes to arrive, but several of the people who were burning were not moving, and what followed were moments of panic and confusion.\" More than 100 federal police secured the area, while the military took control of the airport at San Luis Potosi, Notimex said. Mourino, 37, studied in the United States, receiving an undergraduate degree in economics from the University of Tampa. He did post-graduate studies in accounting and finance from the Universidad Autonoma de Campeche, his government biography says. After serving in municipal government in Campeche, Mourino was a regional coordinator for Vicente Fox's successful presidential candidacy in 2000. He later served in the Mexican federal congress and in the Cabinet. He was chief of the president's office from December 2006 to January 2008.", "3775c657b14066afbac3670c6c97ee6ed5fd5b6a": "(CNN) -- Barack Obama's two daughters had another reason to high-five their dad's election to the presidency Tuesday night: they're getting a puppy. President Bush's dog  Barney walks in the White House Rose Garden in 2007. \"Sasha and Malia,\" Obama said in his victory speech at Chicago's Grant Park, \"I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House.\" The new White House pet will follow in the paw-steps of a menagerie of animals that have had the run of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue over the years. The Bush family shared their eight years at the White House with a cat, a feisty English springer spaniel and two Scottish terriers -- all of whom have their own pages on the president's Web site. The Clintons' Washington stay included a cat, Socks, who did not get along with their chocolate Labrador retriever, Buddy. And Millie the springer spaniel's canine view of life in the White House -- as \"told to\" then-first lady Barbara Bush -- became a best-seller that outsold the memoirs of President George H.W. Bush. While many presidents took to heart President Harry Truman's admonishment -- \"If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog\" -- first pets have come in all shapes, sizes and species. Thomas Jefferson kept two grizzly bears in a cage on the White House lawn, while John Quincy Adams is said to have let his alligator use a bathtub inside. Calvin Coolidge walked his raccoons on a leash. Theodore Roosevelt's sons escorted their pet pony onto the White House elevator to cheer up a sick sibling. And perhaps the strangest of all: Martin Van Buren briefly owned two tiger cubs, a gift from the Sultan of Oman. Pets have sometimes been a boon to a president's image. But some have also taken a bite out of their popularity. Animal lovers howled in protest when Lyndon B. Johnson picked up his beagles, Him and Her, by the ears to provide photographers a better view. On the other hand, Richard Nixon -- running for vice president and accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions -- successfully defended himself in his famous \"Checkers Speech.\" The only gift he ever accepted was \"a little cocker spaniel dog\" that his daughter named Checkers, Nixon said. \"And I just want to say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we are going to keep it,\" he added. Come January, the Obamas will make history by becoming the first African-American family to move into the White House. But if Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, get what they've been promised, the new tenants will keep one long-standing tradition alive ... and wagging.", "2db6cd1d2bdb46ac821d2a1776852696697a7735": "(CNN)  -- Prime Minister Stephen Harper appealed directly to Canadians for support Wednesday, vowing in a nationally televised address on the economy that he will do all he can to halt his opponents from carrying out a no-confidence vote in Parliament -- as planned for Monday -- and forming a coalition government that would replace his own. Prime Minister Stephen Harper accuses coalition leaders of \"betrayal\" by relying on Quebec separatists' support. \"Unfortunately, even before the government has brought forward its budget, and only seven weeks after a general election, the opposition wants to overturn the results of that election,\" said the prime minister, whose Conservative Party strengthened its minority position in federal elections on October 14. \"Canada's government cannot enter into a power-sharing coalition with a separatist party at a time of global insecurity,\" he said. \"Canada's government must stand unequivocally for keeping the country together.\" The country is undergoing \"a pivotal moment in our history,\" he said, then ticked through a list of efforts his government is making to help the country survive the economic crisis, including personal tax reductions, doubling of spending on infrastructure, injecting liquidity into the financial markets and securing pension plans. iReport.com: Outrage brewing in Canada . \"Tonight, I pledge to you that Canada's government will use every legal means at our disposal to protect our democracy, protect our economy and to protect Canada,\" he said. Though Harper did not specify what those legal means might entail, his opponents predicted that he would try to dissolve Parliament and wasted no time in voicing their opposition. The Liberal Party, which lost seats in the October vote, and the leftist New Democratic Party announced plans earlier this week to form a governing coalition with the support of the Bloc Quebecois, which supports independence for French-speaking Quebec. In a televised address that followed Harper's, opposition Liberal leader Stephane Dion called for a vote of confidence. He said he had asked Canada's Governor-General Michaelle Jean -- the acting head of state who would call for a new election or a confidence vote -- \"to refuse any request by the prime minister to suspend Parliament until he has demonstrated to her that he still commands the confidence of the house.\" He said Canada \"is facing the impact of the global economic crisis\" and must act quickly. \"Stephen Harper refuses to propose measures to stimulate the economy\" and his party has lost the confidence of the majority of the House of Commons, he said. \"This means that they have lost the right to govern,\" Dion said. He said he and Jack Layton, head of the New Democratic Party, had agreed to form a coalition government to address the economic crisis, and that the Green Party supported it too. \"Coalitions are normal and put in practice in many parts of the world and are able to work very successfully,\" he said. \"Mr. Harper's solution is to extend the crisis by avoiding a simple vote -- by suspending Parliament and continuing the confusion,\" Dion said. \"We offer a better way. We say, settle it now and let's get to work on the people's business.\" The vote scheduled for Monday ought to be allowed to proceed, he said. In separate televised remarks, Layton accused Harper of having \"delivered a partisan attack.\" The Conservative Party's plan would create no jobs and protect no pensions, he said. \"He seems to be more interested in his job than in protecting your job,\" Layton said. \"Now, that's simply wrong.\"", "beed8cad0900366868ab6d994b8f5991a79149af": "(CNN) -- Adventurer and TV show host Bear Grylls injured his shoulder in Antarctica during an expedition to raise money for an international charity, the Discovery Channel said Sunday. Bear Grylls, host of \"Man vs. Wild,\" was injured in Antarctica during an expedition to raise money for charity. Grylls was injured Friday night after falling during the expedition, which was not for the Discovery Channel, according to the network's statement. The statement said that Grylls is returning to the UK to receive medical attention. \"Once he sees a doctor, we will have a better sense of the level of seriousness of his shoulder injury and the recovery time needed to get him back to his full physical activity,\" according to the statement.

Unfortunately for McCain, the Alaska governor hurt his presidential bid more than she helped. Palin, at McCain's concession Tuesday night, boosted the GOP ticket at first but ultimately became a drag on it. Palin had been unfamiliar to most Americans, aside from some conservative writers and bloggers, who had admired her since she upended Alaska's Republican establishment by knocking off incumbent Gov. Frank Murkowski in 2006. That all changed on August 29 -- the morning after Sen. Barack Obama's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention -- when Palin was introduced by McCain. It wasn't just reporters who were stunned. Even McCain staffers at the event itself were shocked. Many assumed McCain would tap a GOP heavyweight like Mitt Romney or Tim Pawlenty. The most daring option, many thought, would be Joe Lieberman, a former Democrat.  See Palin's path to the ticket \u00bb . But Palin's debut instantly energized the Republican base, which had long been cool to McCain, and the GOP ticket surged in the polls. McCain took a shine to Palin's anti-establishment streak and her familiarity with energy issues. His advisers believed her \"average hockey mom\" persona would attract women. The party grass roots admired her devotion to family and her conservative positions on social issues.  Watch Palin as McCain concedes the election \u00bb . But because the Alaska governor was largely unknown, her record and background were immediately under scrutiny. Journalists descended on her hometown of Wasilla to examine her record as mayor and governor, though Palin was still sheltered from questioners. The craving for knowledge spread outside the media and paid huge dividends at the Republican National Convention, when Palin took the biggest stage of her life and assuredly presented herself as both a small-town mother of five and a pit bull who could smile her way through a sharp political attack. The speech garnered mammoth television ratings and rave reviews. McCain came out of the convention with a healthy bounce -- leading Obama by a 10-point margin. Palin's ratings were also riding high, with nearly 50 percent of Americans viewing her in a positive light. She got bigger crowds than McCain, an unusual phenomenon that underscored her newfound political clout. But a series of missteps began to harm her image and McCain's standing. Palin was still kept away from the media, even friendly conservative talk radio shows, in a strategy that campaign aides later acknowledged was flawed. Advisers chose to grant interviews only to two networks. When Palin stumbled over foreign policy questions, she undercut the foundation of McCain's experience argument. Her sometimes-rambling answers in the highly-scrutinized appearances formed the basis for Tina Fey's \"Saturday Night Live\" caricature. Palin held her own on economic and energy issues in the first half of her debate with Joe Biden -- the highest rated of the presidential and vice-presidential debates. But when questioning turned to national security, she seemed to resort to talking points. Back on the stump, Palin began to attack Obama, accusing him of \"palling around with terrorists,\" being a socialist and not as patriotic as herself and McCain. Her offensives were often scattershot, appearing at one rally and disappearing at the next. And while Republicans enjoyed the aggression, Democrats and independents were turned off. Over a month, poll numbers shifted and Palin became more of a polarizing figure. Liberals called her the most divisive politician since Richard Nixon or George Wallace, and some former Hillary Clinton supporters said McCain's selection of Palin was a cynical gambit that wouldn't help him sway female voters. Palin kept up her rigorous campaign schedule but the problems continued. A long-running ethics investigation in Alaska determined she abused her power in firing the state's public safety commissioner, though she broke no laws. News broke that the Republican National Committee had spent $150,000 on her wardrobe, angering her and prompting her to deviate from the campaign's game plan. iReport.com: What's next for Palin? Aides insisted Palin wanted to speak to reporters but had been reined in. That changed in mid-October when she ditched her staff and launched an impromptu press conference in which she criticized the use of robocalls, even as they were being used for her boss. Later she ad-libbed a diatribe on the wardrobe fiasco, stressing a preference for consignment-store clothing and flashing her $35 wedding ring. McCain aides refused to go on the record about it, but they groused anonymously that Palin was \"going rogue,\" that she was a \"diva\" and \"difficult\" to work with. In the final two weeks, Palin was at last given a chance to make in-depth speeches on substantive issues like energy and special-needs children. But the tide had long turned. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in October showed she had become a bigger drag on McCain than President Bush, with voters citing her qualifications as their primary concern. A CNN poll released last weekend showed Palin's unfavorable ratings were twice as high as when McCain picked her, and 57 percent of Americans believed she didn't have the personal qualities a president needed. As for the future, the poll indicated that only four in 10 voters would support Palin if she chooses to run for president in 2012. But Palin's fortunes have changed before.", "3c48f1e7374a5e120daf77fc2cdf26d76cb64bdb": "(CNN) -- Christine Levinson went to the United Nations on Monday to ask questions about her husband, Bob, a former FBI agent who vanished in Iran last year. Christine Levinson has sought help from Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Levinson flew to New York with three of her seven children in hopes of meeting the one man she hoped could really get things moving -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is at the United Nations for a speech he is scheduled to deliver Tuesday afternoon. Ahmadinejad declined to meet with her. \"I'm disappointed,\" she says. Levinson did meet, however, with the Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. \"He said he would do whatever he could to help me,\" she told CNN. Levinson went to the United Nations with her children -- Susan, 31, Sarah, 28, and Douglas, 14. Her husband disappeared in March 2007 while on a business trip to the Iranian island of Kish. Bob Levinson is a retired FBI agent from Coral Springs, Florida. After leaving the agency, his wife says, he worked as a security consultant specializing in cigarette smuggling. Over the last year and half, Levinson says she has done everything she can to draw attention to her husband's disappearance. She has given interviews, met with U.S. State Department officials, set up a Web site -- www.helpboblevinson.com -- and staged a rally. She even has offered a $5,000 reward, aimed primarily at Iranians who might have information about her husband. Has it yielded any tips? \"No,\" Christine Levinson says. \"Nothing.\" Last year, she traveled to Iran to try to retrace her husband's steps. Back then, Iranian officials told her they would investigate and report back to her. She says she hasn't heard a word. \"They told me when they have some information, they will let me know and in the meantime will continue to search for Bob,\" Levinson told CNN. She has denied that her husband was doing business for the US government when he went missing -- she says she didn't believe so because he's a private citizen. And the State Department and FBI have denied he was working for government. The State Department has demanded Iran free Levinson -- if it is holding him. Levinson says her husband suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure. She insists she is confident her husband is all right because \"I haven't heard anything bad.\" At times, she listens to his voicemail message, just to hear his voice. \"I still firmly believe he is alive,\" she says. \"Every day, I tell my children to take things one day at a time. \"I just want him to know I'm still looking for him. I'll never stop looking for him.\"", "3e8dc14222cdd7d178cb0fa481b08a679cbb061f": "(CNN) -- Caroline Kennedy, who spent most of her life looking to steer clear of the spotlight, is capping off a year of unusually public -- and political -- activity with interest in the Senate seat that would be vacated by Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton. Caroline Kennedy could join her uncle Edward in the United States Senate. And her interest in that seat could mean the continuation of a Kennedy legacy in the Senate that began 56 years ago with the election of her father, John F. Kennedy, as the junior senator from Massachusetts. Her uncle Edward has represented Massachusetts in the Senate for more than four decades. Her uncle Robert served as junior senator from New York from 1965 until he was assassinated in 1968. \"Remember, [Clinton's] seat in the Senate was once held by Robert Kennedy,\" CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said Saturday. \"Her other uncle, Ted Kennedy, is ill right now. If [New York Gov. David] Paterson appoints Caroline Kennedy to the Senate, it means there could be a Kennedy staying in the Senate for quite a long time.\" And a Senate appointment for Caroline Kennedy would mark a change for the woman who has rarely run into the glare of political attention. \"Apparently, she has acquired a taste for politics, having endorsed Barack Obama early this year,\" Schneider said. \"She wants to be part of this new regime in America, clearly playing a key role in the Senate if she gets that appointment.\"  Watch CNN's Bill Schnieder discuss Caroline Kennedy's prospects \u00bb . Widely described as extraordinarily shy, self-deprecating and down-to-earth, Kennedy has tended to limit her forays into the public sphere to nonpartisan activity, penning books on civil liberties and serving as the de facto guardian of her father's legacy. But in January, she backed a political candidate for the first time, announcing her endorsement of Obama during the Democratic primary season with an opinion piece in the New York Times that drew days of the kind of media attention she has spent her life avoiding. \"I have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them,\" she wrote. \"But for the first time, I believe I have found the man who could be that president -- not just for me, but for a new generation of Americans.\" Kennedy willingly lingered in the spotlight, serving on Obama's vice presidential search team, speaking at the Democratic National Convention and stumping for him through the primary and general election seasons. In a campaign ad that featured video images of her father followed by images of Obama, Kennedy said, \"People always tell me how my father inspired them. I feel that same excitement now.\" There are a slew of high-profile candidates for Clinton's Senate seat -- including Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, whose last name carries some star power of its own in the Empire State -- but their odds grew just a bit steeper when stacked against the wattage of a storied Democratic dynasty. Robert Kennedy was elected to the Senate with few ties to his adopted home state, but his niece's New York roots run deep. Jacqueline Kennedy relocated to New York City after her husband's assassination in 1963, with children Caroline and John F. Kennedy Jr. Caroline Kennedy has spent most of her life in the city, working there after graduating from Harvard, meeting her husband, Edwin Schlossberg, on the job at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and attending Columbia Law School there. Her most prominent public roles to date involved overseeing her father's presidential library and presenting the annual Profiles in Courage Award.

Still, in late spring and early summer, she was whispered as a possible vice presidential candidate -- and more recently as a contender for secretary of education in an Obama Cabinet -- but elected office would mark a major shift for Kennedy. Her history of avoiding partisan efforts, her limited policy track record and the lingering legacy of her father's presidency translated into a far less brutal Republican criticism than that experienced by the other members of Obama's vice presidential search committee, and there was a widespread continuing sense that she would not want to put herself in line for the tough criticism aimed at elected officials. \"I don't think she'd go that far,\" Kennedy White House speechwriter Theodore Sorenson told USA Today this summer after being asked whether he thought Kennedy wanted to hold office herself.

Caroline Kennedy could join her uncle Edward in the U.S. Senate. And her interest in that seat could mean the continuation of a Kennedy legacy in the Senate that began 56 years ago with the election of her father, John F. Kennedy, as the junior senator from Massachusetts. Her uncle Edward has represented Massachusetts in the Senate for more than four decades. Her uncle Robert served as junior senator from New York from 1965 until he was assassinated in 1968. \"Remember, [Clinton's] seat in the Senate was once held by Robert Kennedy,\" CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said Saturday. \"Her other uncle, Ted Kennedy, is ill right now. If [New York Gov. David] Paterson appoints Caroline Kennedy to the Senate, it means there could be a Kennedy staying in the Senate for quite a long time.\" Paterson confirmed to CNN Saturday that Caroline Kennedy called and \"asked a few questions\" but did not express interest in the seat. \"I am sure if she's interested, she'll call back, but I'm not going to rate any of the candidates or talk about prospective candidates. It just adds speculation to the speculation,\" Paterson said. But one Democratic source close to the Kennedy family said Caroline Kennedy \"is interested to say the least\" about discussing the Senate vacancy. The source said Kennedy has asked a tight circle of family friends and political advisers for advice. A second source, who has knowledge of Kennedy's conversation with Paterson, tells CNN that Kennedy reached out to inquire about the responsibilities and impact such a move would have if she were selected by the governor to fill the position. A Senate appointment for Caroline Kennedy would mark a change for the woman who has rarely run into the glare of political attention. \"Apparently, she has acquired a taste for politics, having endorsed Barack Obama early this year,\" Schneider said. \"She wants to be part of this new regime in America, clearly playing a key role in the Senate if she gets that appointment.\"  Watch CNN's Bill Schneider discuss Caroline Kennedy's prospects \u00bb . Widely described as extraordinarily shy, self-deprecating and down-to-earth, Kennedy has tended to limit her forays into the public sphere to nonpartisan activity, penning books on civil liberties and serving as the de facto guardian of her father's legacy. But in January, she backed a political candidate for the first time, announcing her endorsement of Obama during the Democratic primary season with an opinion piece in the New York Times that drew days of the kind of media attention she has spent her life avoiding. \"I have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them,\" she wrote. \"But for the first time, I believe I have found the man who could be that president -- not just for me, but for a new generation of Americans.\" Kennedy willingly lingered in the spotlight, serving on Obama's vice presidential search team, speaking at the Democratic National Convention and stumping for him through the primary and general election seasons. In a campaign ad that featured video images of her father followed by images of Obama, Kennedy said, \"People always tell me how my father inspired them. I feel that same excitement now.\" There are a slew of high-profile candidates for Clinton's Senate seat -- including Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, whose last name carries some star power of its own in the Empire State -- but their odds grew just a bit steeper when stacked against the wattage of a storied Democratic dynasty. Robert Kennedy was elected to the Senate with few ties to his adopted home state, but his niece's New York roots run deep. Jacqueline Kennedy relocated to New York City after her husband's assassination in 1963, with children Caroline and John F. Kennedy Jr. Caroline Kennedy has spent most of her life in the city, working there after graduating from Harvard, meeting her husband, Edwin Schlossberg, on the job at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and attending Columbia Law School there. Her most prominent public roles to date involved overseeing her father's presidential library and presenting the annual Profiles in Courage Award. She's also edited several books, from a volume of children's poetry and an updated edition of her father's book \"Profiles in Courage\" to a collection of patriotic verse (\"A Patriot's Handbook: Songs, Poems, Stories, and Speeches Celebrating the Land We Love.\") Most of her leadership positions have been based in the arts: hosting the annual nationally televised Kennedy Center Honors in Washington and serving as the honorary chairwoman of the American Ballet Theatre, as her mother had.

Western tourists oblivious to the severe drugs laws in the UAE often end up in jail after arriving in the conservative Muslim country with tiny amounts of narcotics. DJ Grooverider, whose real name is Raymond Bingham, was jailed Tuesday for four years in Dubai for possession of cannabis, said a spokesman for BBC Radio 1, where the he presented a weekly drum 'n bass show. He was arrested November 23 after being caught with 2.16 grams of the drug at the airport, the BBC spokesman said. \"It's another incident of exactly the sort of case we've seen occurring with increased frequency,\" said Catherine Wolthuizen, chief executive of Fair Trials International. The charity issued a warning to travelers earlier this month, urging them to read up on Dubai's restrictions and make sure they are free of any substances. The warning followed a series of cases in which Dubai authorities arrested travelers with trace amounts of banned substances or seemingly innocuous items. Fair Trials highlighted the case of a Swiss man jailed for having three poppy seeds on his shirt which apparently came from a sandwich he had eaten at the airport before departure. UAE customs officials said the man was stopped after arriving in Dubai from Zurich on January 18, though it provided no other details on his case. The U.S. State Department warns that poppy seeds are on the UAE's list of controlled substances. An official at the UAE's police labs who declined to be named said the Emirates only ban raw poppy seeds -- not baked -- because raw seeds could be planted for drug use. The British and U.S. governments have warnings in place for travelers to the UAE, alerting them to the severe penalties for being found with drugs, and the types of drugs which are illegal in the country. \"The possession and/or import of even the smallest amount of drugs can result in a minimum prison sentence of four years,\" states the advice from Britain's Foreign Office. \"The presence of drugs in the system is counted as possession.\" Some prescribed medications -- such as Valium or those used for hormone replacement therapy -- are forbidden even with a prescription, Fair Trials said. Codeine, which is available over the counter in Britain, is allowed only with a doctor's prescription, the Foreign Office states. Fair Trials mentioned the case of an unnamed 20-year-old who was traveling back to England from Pakistan. The charity said he was arrested after customs officers allegedly found 0.02 grams of cannabis in his pocket. UAE customs officials told CNN the 20-year-old was arrested January 16 and actually was found with 0.67 grams of cannabis. \"Travelers must be aware about and understand the laws of any country they visit,\" said a customs official, who also declined to be named. The BBC spokesman said Grooverider, who went to Dubai to work at a club, claimed he forgot the drugs were in the pocket of a pair of trousers. \"Grooverider is paying a very high price for a serious mistake,\" the Radio 1 spokesman said. Fair Trials' Wolthuizen said one thing is clear: Travelers to the UAE must be careful. \"The Emirates are quite happy to be known as having an unusually strict approach to enforcing their drug laws,\" Wolthuizen said. \"They are going to extraordinary lengths to enforce them.\" E-mail to a friend .", "8ee18b07b0be44484fc35742c2bef618699aa19c": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Cash-strapped Zimbabwe revealed plans Saturday to circulate $200 million notes, just days after introducing a $100 million bill, Finance Minister Samuel Mumbengegwi said.

She was 76. Sunny von Bulow is pictured during her 1957 wedding to Prince Alfred von Auersperg. Von Bulow was subject of one of the nation's most sensational criminal cases during the 1980s. Her husband, Claus, was accused of trying to kill her with an overdose of insulin, which prosecutors alleged sent her into the coma. He was convicted of making two attempts on her life, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. He was acquitted in a second trial. His retrial in 1985 received national attention. \"We were blessed to have an extraordinarily loving and caring mother,\" said the statement from Von Bulow's three children -- Annie Laurie \"Ala\" Isham, Alexander von Auersperg and Cosima Pavoncelli -- released by a spokeswoman. \"She was especially devoted to her many friends and family members.\" Martha von Bulow was born Martha Sharp Crawford into a wealthy family. She inherited a fortune conservatively estimated at $75 million, according to an article on the von Bulow case posted on truTV.com's Crime Library Web site. In her early years, she drew comparisons to actress Grace Kelly. She became known as Princess von Auersperg with her first marriage, to Prince Alfred von Auersperg of Austria. That marriage produced two children: Alexander and Annie Laurie. The von Bulows married in 1966 and had a daughter, Cosima. On the morning of December 22, 1980, family members found Martha von Bulow unconscious in the bathroom of the family's posh Newport, Rhode Island, home. She never regained consciousness. She had been hospitalized a year earlier after lapsing into a coma but recovered, according to the Crime Library site. Doctors had diagnosed her with hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. Prosecutors accused Claus von Bulow of twice attempting to kill his wife by injecting her with insulin. The case also led to a major motion picture, \"Reversal of Fortune.\" Actor Jeremy Irons won an Oscar for his portrayal of Claus von Bulow. Famed defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, who won Claus von Bulow a new trial on appeal after his conviction, said in a statement Saturday that Martha von Bulow's death is \"a sad ending to a sad tragedy that some members of her family tried to turn into a crime. We proved overwhelming[ly] that there was no crime and that the coma was self-induced. We saved his life, but could not save hers.\" Claus von Bulow's defense team maintained that Martha von Bulow's alcohol use, among other factors, caused her coma. Dershowitz said he had spoken with Claus von Bulow, who now lives in London, England. Claus von Bulow was saddened by his former wife's passing, Dershowitz said. The family statement said Martha von Bulow is survived by her children, their spouses and nine grandchildren. Alexander von Auersperg and Ala von Auersperg Isham, who had sided with prosecutors against Claus von Bulow, filed a civil suit against their stepfather after his acquittal. The case was settled out of court in 1987, according to a 2007 article in the Providence Journal newspaper in Rhode Island. Claus von Bulow had agreed to waive his claim to his wife's money and to a divorce in exchange for the suit being dropped. The von Bulows' daughter, Cosima, sided with her father. Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne, who covered the von Bulow case, told the New York Daily News in 2007 that Sunny von Bulow was moved from Columbia Presbyterian hospital to a private nursing home in 1998.

Martin for his weekly sound-off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. ET Wednesday. If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. A nationally syndicated columnist, Martin has said he will vote for Barack Obama in November. He is the author of \"Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith\" and \"Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America.\" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland Martin says Howard Dean bucked other leaders and insisted on a 50-state Democratic strategy. (CNN) -- If Sen. Barack Obama is able to prevail over Sen. John McCain on Tuesday, all of those Democrats who ripped Howard Dean's 50-state strategy over the last four years should call the head of the Democratic National Committee and offer a heartfelt apology. First in line should be New York Sen. Charles Schumer, Chicago, Illinois, Rep. Rahm Emanuel and my CNN colleague, political strategist James Carville. When Democrats were in the final stages of winning back Congress in 2006, those three were at odds with Dean, saying he should forget about his pie-in-the-sky plan to have the Democratic Party competitive in all 50 states. They reasoned that money spent on get-out-the vote efforts in non-congressional elections was futile, and all the effort should be on reclaiming Congress. But Dean resisted their suggestions, weathering repeated calls for him to resign after that election. Dean's insistence on having a Democratic Party that existed in the heartland, and not just California, New York and Massachusetts, was brilliant in that it made clear that the party recognized the rest of America. iReport.com: What would you ask Obama? The Democratic Party earned its liberal label because it ignored the moderate and conservative voices that paved the way for the Reagan revolution to win three consecutive elections. Yet the decisive wins weren't just on the national level. Texas is a prime example. What used to be a blue dog Democratic state now has Republicans holding every statewide office. But things are looking up. In Dallas County, all of the county positions except for a handful were in the hands of the GOP, especially the judges. That changed four years ago, and now the party could solidify itself this time around. The same thing in Harris County. The state's most populous county saw Republicans take everything in sight. This time around, Democrats are poised to take back Houston and surrounding cities. Texas Democratic leaders used to cry the blues when an election was near, but after seeing the massive turnout during the primary, they have been able to build their voter database and cultivate a new generation of politicians to run for office. Will the state go red? Sure. But with a rock solid black vote, the ability to attract more Hispanic voters and a growing appeal to whites, Democrats may soon make Texas a competitive two-party state. If Democrats are going to achieve success on the national level, they must have significant enthusiasm on the local level. It's hard to get your supporters ginned up for a national campaign if they see no infrastructure, especially local get-out-the-vote operations. When Obama announced that he was implementing a 50-state strategy, he was laughed at. But here we are with six days left in the campaign and the Republicans are having to spend precious dollars on ads in Montana, North Carolina, Virginia, Missouri, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada, GOP locks in past elections. Obama deserves a lot of the credit for this because his \"change\" campaign theme, along with the horrible leadership of Republicans nationwide, is helping his candidacy. But changing the attitude among the nation's Democrats was also vital, and that's where Dean played a role. The former governor of Vermont saw firsthand the sorry shape of the party when he ran for president in 2004. Republicans, led by Karl Rove, perfected their voter registration efforts, targeting voters down to the neighborhood, block and household. They knew that to win they needed a well-oiled machine that wasn't activated every four years; it needed to be active all year round and in every election cycle. So Dean put the people and resources behind substantial voter efforts in a number of states, and they went about rebuilding a crippled party that had no central voter registration effort, an outdated database of supporters, a fundraising arm that heavily relied on trial attorneys and Hollywood types, and a message that changed depending on the day. In addition to seeing how Obama performs on Tuesday, we will also watch and see if Democrats are able to increase the number of governorships and legislatures they control. That will be critical in 2010, because that's when the electoral map will be gerrymandered, redrawing the borders of congressional districts, and the party that rules the general assemblies, legislatures and governor's mansions will write the rules to the game. Old pols always said that all politics is local, and the only way for a revitalized Democratic Party to expand its reach nationally is by re-branding the party on the home front. That takes time, money and leadership, and Howard Dean was willing to put his money where his mouth is.

Besides the canal, Panama has a lot to offer: There are mountains, beaches, colonial cities and rain forests. After we found a $158 round trip flight from Miami, Florida, the decision was made. My only fear was the weather; it was rainy season in Central America. After weeks of research, I was torn. We had enough time to visit one set of islands, and there were two island chains that I was having a hard time choosing between. The San Blas Islands are off the northeast coast of Panama in the Caribbean. They're also known as Kuna Yala and are home to the Kuna Indians. It would be a chance to see the Kunas up close, living as they have for centuries in grass huts along the water's edge. The other option was the Pearl Islands. The Archipi\u00e9lago de las Perlas, less well-known than the San Blas, is off the southern Pacific coast of Panama. After an agonizing week of self-debate, I decided that our summer vacation would include a trip to the Pearl Islands. The flight was only 20 minutes from Panama City, but more importantly, I was told it didn't rain as much on the Pacific side. The sales pitch to my niece: \"We are going to where the 2003 edition of 'Survivor' and 'Survivor: All-Stars' were filmed.\" I was referring to the popular American reality TV show, and I didn't realize that dozens of other countries had their own versions. I admit my destination choice was not as educational as a few days with the Kuna Indians, but I thought it would be better than being rained in with a bored teenager. After a short flight from Panama City in a puddle jumper, we were on the island of Contadora, one of hundreds that make up the Pearl Islands and one of three that can be reached by commercial flight. It's a tiny island with a handful of places to stay and even fewer places to get a meal. Golf carts, the primary mode of transportation, can be rented upon arrival. All of Contadora's entertainment is provided by the sea. It's a beach bum's paradise. If you are a beach bum and a reality TV fan, you can sit on the sand and watch props being built for the contestants' challenges. It's probably the best set shop in the world, or at least the one with the nicest view. But the Pearl Islands offer more than just an exotic TV set. For $30 an hour, you can go snorkeling and island hopping in a small but comfortable wooden fishing boat. We found Ni\u00f1o, our boat captain and guide, on Playa Larga, the beach in front of the Contadora Beach Resort. We did some of the best snorkeling I've ever done anywhere in the world. After a morning of fantastic snorkeling, I asked Ni\u00f1o where \"Survivor\" was filmed. \"Close by. I will take you there,\" he said. Ni\u00f1o took us to Mogo Mogo, one of many uninhabited islands just off the shore of Contadora. As the island's white sandy beaches came into sight, we noticed a clearing where people were putting finishing touches on what looked like a game for contestants. Our boat captain told us it was for \"Desaf\u00edo\" (\"Challenge\"), a Colombian version of the popular reality show. The word on Contadora was that a few countries (Bulgaria, Serbia and Israel, to name a few) were either finishing filming \"Survivor\"-type shows or starting new seasons. A representative for the Panamanian Institute of Tourism told me the government had limited information on the filming and could not confirm the word on the street. We jumped out of the boat, waded through the clear, warm blue water and onto Mogo Mogo, unacknowledged as work continued on the wooden set. Noticing a well-worn path, we decided to check out the rest of the island. We thought we were alone when we reached the beach on the other side. But as we walked down what we thought was a deserted beach, we spotted an orange flag in the sand. We knew the American \"Survivor\" was filmed on this island, but we did not expect to be standing in front of contestants in orange buffs, sitting on a log in the shade. This is when the man with the walkie-talkie shushed us because they were filming. The locals talk about the shows and the many countries they hail from, but they don't seem to capitalize on the \"Survivor\" fame. Contadora locals certainly make money off the film staff, medics and contestants, but evidently they haven't printed the T-shirts yet. The only shirts we saw were on the backs of others that identified them as \"Survivor Crew.\" Perhaps a true fan could purchase a shirt directly off someone's back. The island is only so big, and you are bound to run into a crew from some country. One night, we were the only non-reality show customers in Gerald's restaurant, a popular place for beer and pizza. After our innocent but failed attempt at a guest appearance on \"Desaf\u00edo,\" we returned to the basic comforts on Contadora. That night, as we relaxed in a restaurant -- cold drinks in hand, a warm hearty meal just ordered -- darkness fell. The rain, as it often does in the tropics, started coming down in sheets. I leaned back and thought to myself, \"If I was a contestant, tonight I would vote myself off of Mogo Mogo.\"", "1dfa1939b4e56d28cb081eb2a196e5d7aa4db1ca": "(CNN) -- California voters on Tuesday appear to have approved Proposition 8, a measure banning same-sex marriage in the state. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin says the U.S. Supreme Court may have to rule on the issue of same-sex marriage. California's secretary of state late Tuesday released semi-official results showing Proposition 8 had passed 52.5 percent to 47.5 percent. CNN has not officially called the result one way or the other. On Wednesday protesters took to the streets of Los Angeles to voice their opposition to the potential ban. And there are at least three legal challenges to it now pending in court. Kiran Chetry of CNN's \"American Morning\" spoke Thursday with the program's legal analyst, Sunny Hostin, about the issue. Chetry: California's attorney general says that the constitutional amendment is not retroactive, and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom says he will continue to marry people until someone sues him to stop. So what does Prop 8 mean first of all to people who want to get married in the state of California? Hostin: Well, we already know in Los Angeles they are no longer issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. So in Los Angeles, it's a no go. In San Francisco, as you mentioned, the mayor is saying, \"We're still going to be doing it.\" So for people that aren't married yet, it's really legal limbo. Chetry: All right. And what about people who from the time that they allowed same-sex marriage, this was in May until November, some 18,000 couples decided they were going to do it. What happens to them? Is their marriage still valid? Hostin: It's still valid right now. But really they are also in a legal limbo. The bottom line it's all over the place. The law is really unclear here. Last night, I was poring over these legal papers. I was also discussing this with a lot of law professors, a lot of different lawyers, and everyone is all over the place. Some folks said, you know, the bottom line is when you look at the language of Proposition 8, it is very clear that it was meant to be retroactive and that means that all the marriages will be invalidated. Then another law professor that I spoke to said that is absolutely fundamentally ridiculous. The bottom line is this is a fundamental right that was given to couples and this is a right that is not going to be given away. I think we're going to see a lot of litigation here, Kiran, and the bottom line is everyone is in a legal, legal limbo. Chetry: It's very interesting the grounds for which they are challenging. At least in one of these lawsuits they said that it was a constitutional revision rather than an amendment. And that means it would need two-thirds approval of the House in the legislature. So do we think it could go to the state house in California as well as being fought in the courts? Hostin: I really think this is going to be a legal issue. I think this is going to go before the California Supreme Court. And we already know as you mentioned  that there are three cases pending before the California Supreme Court. And what is interesting to note is that it's the very same court that allowed these marriages in the first place. And so, my guess is that that court is going to weigh in, probably reinstitute the right to marry for same-sex couples and then that's going to be likely based on the U.S. Constitution and our Supreme Court is going to weigh in. What is I think extremely interesting here is that we now know that we have a president-elect, Obama. He's going to get the opportunity likely to appoint Supreme Court justices. So we don't even know which type of court or the makeup of the court that will hear this. But I think the Supreme Court will likely weigh in on this issue. Chetry: This was such a hot button issue in the state. More spending on either side, $35 million, $37 million on both sides. Hostin: Yes. Chetry: It was the highest funded campaign on any state ballot. Hostin: That's right. Chetry: They say it trumped every other campaign except the presidential. Hostin: People care about this issue. I mean, they're talking about discrimination, equal protection. It's an issue that's a hotbed issue. We also know, Kiran, that in Arizona and Florida that this ban was implemented. And so, you know, it's all over the place. People care about this issue, and this is an issue that is really present. And I think that it's something that, we, of course, have to watch because we're talking about equal protection, we're talking about discrimination. People care about these issues. Chetry: Sunny Hostin, great to see you. Thank you. Hostin: Thanks. iReport.com: Did you vote on a same-sex measure?", "3893e21050e1872765a6a7dd31b0d6e7584d765a": "Editor's Note: Drew Westen, Ph.D., is professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University, founder of Westen Strategies, and author of \"The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.\" He has been a consultant or adviser to several candidates and organizations, including the AFL-CIO, and has informally advised the Obama campaign. Drew Westen says Democrats realized you need more than position papers to sway the voters. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A single factor never produces a complex event like the historic election of Barack Obama. But when the final post-mortem on the election of 2008 is someday written, it will no doubt include at least three. First, John McCain started with three strikes against him. Those strikes happen to be the three strongest predictors that enter into the equations used by political scientists to predict who will win an election: an unpopular incumbent president (in this case, the most unpopular in the history of polling), an economic downturn (in this case an understatement), and an unpopular war. In some ways, McCain lost the presidency twice to George W. Bush. In the 2000 South Carolina primary, McCain was defeated by what have been generously referred to as \"dirty tricks;\" and in the two-year run-up to the 2008 election, he allied himself with Bush and his policies to win his party's nomination (even referring to Bush as \"one of our greatest presidents\"), which was his undoing with independent voters in the general election. Second, whether McCain rues the day he chose Sarah Palin (who moved from the asset to the liability column around the same time Lehman Brothers did), Palin no doubt rues the day she chose to become a small-town mayor instead of a community organizer. It was precisely the extraordinary capacity to organize people that allowed Obama and his chief advisers to bring such unprecedented numbers of people to the polls. Not only was this the first election in recent memory in which Democrats outgunned Republicans with their get-out-the-vote efforts, but it was the first time since Eisenhower recognized the potential value of television as a medium for advertising over 50 years ago that Democrats have led Republicans in technology. From the moment I met Obama's media wizard, Scott Goodstein, 18 months ago, I realized Obama would have a tremendous advantage on that front, but I didn't realize by how much. But then there's that other major factor: For the first time since Bill Clinton, the Democrats chose a candidate with both the general intelligence to govern and the emotional and political intelligence to win. And they finally abandoned the approach to campaigning that has been their downfall for generations: peppering voters with facts, figures, and policy positions and assuming they will see what a rational choice the candidate is. We don't choose any of the important people in our lives that way, whether spouses or presidents. Obama beat McCain the same way he beat Hillary Clinton: by out-inspiring them, boxing them into the role of the candidate against hope, and defining himself as the candidate who represents change. And in the last few weeks of the campaign, Obama finally began to control the four stories that matter in an election: . 1. the story you tell about your yourself (that he was the candidate of change, fleshing out what he meant by change); . 2. the story you tell about your opponent (that McCain was four more years of Bush); . 3. the story the other candidate is telling about himself (McCain the maverick, which Obama countered by citing McCain's proud proclamation that he had voted with Bush over 90 percent of the time and parrying, \"That's not a maverick, that's a sidekick\"); and . 4. the story McCain was telling about Obama (that he lacked the experience and judgment to lead, which Obama countered with his steadiness in the face of the Wall Street meltdown and his strong, steady performances in the debates). Elections are won by candidates who control those four stories and in so doing inspire the electorate and channel their fears (in this case, fears about the economy trumping all else). Going forward, Obama needs to find his way as a leader between the excesses of the \"permanent campaign,\" in which a president remains in campaign mode throughout his presidency -- taken to its extreme under George W. Bush, who allowed his political strategist, Karl Rove, an inordinate role in crafting policies rather than just figuring out how to talk with the public about them -- and Obama's more natural predilection to talk like a law professor. What Democrats learned from this election is that if their candidate thinks like a professor but inspires like a preacher, they can have their cake and eat it, too. President-elect Obama faces enormous mountains to climb that will require enormous public support. He will no doubt pursue the policies he considers best for digging our nation out of some deep ditches, both domestically and internationally. But the best policies don't sell themselves, whether the date is November 3 or January 21, and the style that led him to the White House -- a calm, thoughtful, steady approach to policy combined with an extraordinary capacity to inspire -- is the same style that will make him an extraordinary leader.

Sonny Perdue declared a water supply emergency in north Georgia on Saturday as its water resources dwindled to a dangerously low level after months of drought. But an Army Corps of Engineers official denied there is a water crisis. Perdue, who signed an executive order Saturday, asked for President Bush's help in easing regulations that require the state to send water downstream to Alabama and Florida. He also asked the president to declare 85 counties as federal disaster areas. Perdue blasted what he called the \"silly rules\" governing the water supplies, noting that even if the state got replenishing rains, it could not by law conserve those, but must release 3.2 billion gallons a day downstream. \"The actions of the Corps of Engineers and Fish and Wildlife Service are not only irresponsible, I believe they're downright dangerous and Georgia cannot stand for this negligence,\" Perdue said. The Army Corps of Engineers, however, presented a different assessment. If there were nine months without rain, water supplies still would be adequate, said Maj. Daren Payne, the Army Corps' deputy commander for the Mobile, Alabama, District. The corps sent a letter to Perdue assessing the situation and pointing out that they are \"not going to run out [of water] any time soon,\" Payne said. The corps -- under an agreement reached in the 1980s with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the state and downstream users -- releases 5,000 feet of water per second from the dam between Lake Lanier and the Chattahoochee River. The figure was based on a Florida hydroelectric power plant's needs, as well as concern for endangered species in the river, including mussels and sturgeon. On Friday, Georgia filed a motion seeking to require the Army Corps of Engineers to restrict water flows from the lake and other north Georgia reservoirs.  Watch Gov. Perdue blast a \"disaster of federal bureaucracy\" \u00bb . The corps said it needs 120 days to review its water policies, according to Perdue. The Bush administration has been in contact with the Georgia congressional delegation on the matter, the White House said Saturday afternoon . \"We have already begun drafting interim rules to ... address the endangered species requirements, and the Army Corps has started the process of revising the operations manual for the river basin,\" said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino. Months of drought . Rainfall in north Georgia, which includes the Atlanta metropolitan area, is far below normal for this time of year. That was evident as Perdue addressed reporters on packed red clay on the shore of Lake Lanier -- the main water source for the Atlanta area's 5 million residents. Normally, he'd be standing in water, but levels have dropped to historically low levels. The drought is hurting businesses and scaring away tourists. Efforts are under way to try to reduce the flow from Lake Lanier by looking into requirements for endangered species and demands downstream for power plants and industries, Payne said. A new biological review of endangered species needs will end in November and will be examined by officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to see if water requirements can be reduced, he added. \"The corps is not opposed to reducing the flow, if it can do it legally,\" Payne said. Georgia, Alabama and Florida have been wrangling over how to allocate water from the Chattahoochee watershed for years as metro Atlanta's population has doubled since 1980. \"No one is sacrificing, no one is sharing the pain like the people in north Georgia are,\" Perdue said, noting there are no water restrictions in Florida or southern Alabama. Georgia has imposed a mandatory ban on outdoor water use by homeowners in the region, but Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle warned this is a situation \"we cannot conserve our way out of.\" Meanwhile, individual counties are monitoring illegal water use. In Douglas County, violators will have their water supply turned off and may have to pay up to $1,000 to get it turned back on. Cobb County, just north of Atlanta, is doling out fines of up to $500 for repeat offenders. E-mail to a friend .

A French army helicopter taking off from French frigate Nivose,  on patrol in the Gulf of Aden. EU foreign ministers approved the mission during their regular meeting in Brussels on Monday. Solana said the operation is \"very important\" because EU vessels will be operating \"in a place in the world that everybody's looking at because of the new problems related to piracy.\" \"It's very important that we have taken that decision to launch it tomorrow,\" he added. The EU naval force will take over the role of escorting United Nations World Food Program vessels carrying food and relief supplies to war-torn Somalia, an EU news release said. Its mandate, which is spelled out in several U.N. Security Council resolutions, also will include \"the protection of vulnerable vessels cruising off the Somali coast, and the deterrence, prevention and repression of acts of piracy and armed robbery off the Somali coast,\" the news release stated. The deployment follows a decision by the European Council in September that established a coordination cell that supported surveillance and protection operations by several member states off the Somali coast. Piracy has become increasingly common in that area this year, particularly in the Gulf of Aden. So far, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau. Those hijacked vessels include an enormous oil tanker, a chemical tanker, and a ship laden with Soviet-era arms, including tanks. The pirates normally hold the ships for ransom. The Somali-based pirates have extended their reach beyond Somalia's coastline. On Saturday, a Dutch-operated container ship outran pirates off the coast of Tanzania, an IMB official told CNN. A luxury cruise ship carrying more than 1,000 passengers and crew successfully outran pirates off the coast of Yemen last weekend. A multinational fleet -- including vessels from the United States, NATO member states, Russia and India -- has been patrolling the Indian Ocean waters near the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Around 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year. In a recent interview provided to CNN, a pirate leader claimed attacks on shipping would continue so long as life in Somalia remained desperate. \"The pirates are living between life and death,\" said the pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah. \"Who can stop them? Americans and British all put together cannot do anything.\"", "a4bea817552f52e415984a7e8b88d327587667a8": "NEW YORK (CNN)  -- After spending nearly 28 years in an irreversible coma, heiress and socialite Martha \"Sunny\" von Bulow died Saturday in a New York nursing home, according to a family statement. She was 76. Sunny von Bulow is pictured during her 1957 wedding to Prince Alfred von Auersperg. Von Bulow was subject of one of the nation's most sensational criminal cases during the 1980s. Her husband, Claus, was accused of trying to kill her with an overdose of insulin, which prosecutors alleged sent her into the coma. He was convicted of making two attempts on her life, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. He was acquitted in a second trial. His retrial in 1985 received national attention. \"We were blessed to have an extraordinarily loving and caring mother,\" said the statement from Von Bulow's three children -- Annie Laurie \"Ala\" Isham, Alexander von Auersperg and Cosima Pavoncelli -- released by a spokeswoman. \"She was especially devoted to her many friends and family members.\" Martha von Bulow was born Martha Sharp Crawford into a wealthy family. She inherited a fortune conservatively estimated at $75 million, according to an article on the von Bulow case posted on truTV.com's Crime Library Web site. In her early years, she drew comparisons to actress Grace Kelly. She became known as Princess von Auersperg with her first marriage, to Prince Alfred von Auersperg of Austria. That marriage produced two children: Alexander and Annie Laurie. The von Bulows married in 1966 and had a daughter, Cosima. On the morning of December 22, 1980, family members found Martha von Bulow unconscious in the bathroom of the family's posh Newport, Rhode Island, home. She never regained consciousness. She had been hospitalized a year earlier after lapsing into a coma but recovered, according to the Crime Library site. Doctors had diagnosed her with hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. Prosecutors accused Claus von Bulow of twice attempting to kill his wife by injecting her with insulin. The case also led to a major motion picture, \"Reversal of Fortune.\" Actor Jeremy Irons won an Oscar for his portrayal of Claus von Bulow. Famed defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, who won Claus von Bulow a new trial on appeal after his conviction, said in a statement Saturday that Martha von Bulow's death is \"a sad ending to a sad tragedy that some members of her family tried to turn into a crime. We proved overwhelming[ly] that there was no crime and that the coma was self-induced. We saved his life, but could not save hers.\" Claus von Bulow's defense team maintained that Martha von Bulow's alcohol use, among other factors, caused her coma. Dershowitz said he had spoken with Claus von Bulow, who now lives in London, England. Claus von Bulow was saddened by his former wife's passing, Dershowitz said. The family statement said Martha von Bulow is survived by her children, their spouses and nine grandchildren. Alexander von Auersperg and Ala von Auersperg Isham, who had sided with prosecutors against Claus von Bulow, filed a civil suit against their stepfather after his acquittal. The case was settled out of court in 1987, according to a 2007 article in the Providence Journal newspaper in Rhode Island. Claus von Bulow had agreed to waive his claim to his wife's money and to a divorce in exchange for the suit being dropped. The von Bulows' daughter, Cosima, sided with her father. Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne, who covered the von Bulow case, told the New York Daily News in 2007 that Sunny von Bulow was moved from Columbia Presbyterian hospital to a private nursing home in 1998.

Authorities rescued the monkey from Gypsy Lawson's fake womb. Gypsy Lawson, 28, and her mother, Fran Ogren, 56, were convicted of smuggling and conspiracy to smuggle the monkey in violation of the Endangered Species Act and other federal laws. Lawson hid the young rhesus macaque monkey under a loose-fitting blouse on a flight from Bangkok, Thailand, to Los Angeles, California, International Airport, pretending she was pregnant, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Washington said. Permits are required to possess rhesus monkeys and many other species of animals. Such permits are granted for research, enhancement and conservation purposes. Additionally, transporting such species into the United States requires a customs declaration. Lawson and Ogren had neither. \"These defendants purposely undertook a course of action which could well have endangered many citizens, as well as the life of the animal in question,\" said U.S. Attorney James McDevitt. Rhesus monkeys are known to carry viruses and parasites that can be transmitted to humans, said Paul Chang, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent. \"This particular animal tested negative,\" he said. Chang said the monkey has been placed with a rescue center for abandoned primates, \"but it could have been living out its life with its family in its native habitat.\" Authorities found journals and handwritten notes describing the mother and daughter's attempts to find a monkey small enough to smuggle back to the United States. The journal also described the pair's \"acquisition of a small monkey and their experimenting with different medicines to sedate the monkey for their journey home,\" McDevitt's office said. Authorities also found photographs of Lawson at two airports and on an airplane in which she is wearing loose-fitting clothing and appears to be pregnant. \"The journal confirms that she and her mother smuggled the monkey into the United States by hiding it under her shirt, pretending she was pregnant in order to get past authorities,\" the statement from McDevitt's office said. Co-defendant James Edward Pratt, 34, already has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of possession and transportation of prohibited wildlife. He will be sentenced in January. Sentencing for Lawson and Ogren is scheduled for March 3, 2009. The smuggling conviction carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release. The conspiracy charge carries a maximum of five years in prison, a $250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release. Flight itineraries show the pair flew from Spokane, Washington, to Bangkok on November 4-5, 2007, with stops in Seattle, Washington, and Inchon, South Korea. They returned on a direct flight from Bangkok to Los Angeles, California, on November 28, 2007.", "84ced5c56d8b021c11ed63055e0f8f26b1d15994": "(CNN) -- Two airmen were found dead in the Pacific Ocean and rescuers were trying to find four others after a U.S. Air Force B-52 crashed off the island of Guam on Monday, the Air Force said.

Lift to space: This is a NASA interpretation of what a space elevator may look like. The project is a \"space elevator,\" and some experts now believe that the concept is well within the bounds of possibility -- maybe even within our lifetimes. A conference discussing developments in space elevator concepts is being held in Japan in November, and hundreds of engineers and scientists from Asia, Europe and the Americas are working to design the only lift that will take you directly to the one hundred-thousandth floor. Despite these developments, you could be excused for thinking it all sounds a little far-fetched. Indeed, if successfully built, the space elevator would be an unprecedented feat of human engineering. A cable anchored to the Earth's surface, reaching tens of thousands of kilometers into space, balanced with a counterweight attached at the other end is the basic design for the elevator. It is thought that inertia -- the physics theory stating that matter retains its velocity along a straight line so long as it is not acted upon by an external force -- will cause the cable to stay stretched taut, allowing the elevator to sit in geostationary orbit. The cable would extend into the sky, eventually reaching a satellite docking station orbiting in space. Engineers hope the elevator will transport people and objects into space, and there have even been suggestions that it could be used to dispose of nuclear waste. Another proposed idea is to use the elevator to place solar panels in space to provide power for homes on Earth. If it sounds like the stuff of fiction, maybe that's because it once was. In 1979, Arthur C. Clarke's novel \"The Fountains of Paradise\" brought the idea of a space elevator to a mass audience. Charles Sheffield's \"The Web Between the Worlds\" also featured the building of a space elevator. But, jump out of the storybooks and fast-forward nearly three decades, and Japanese scientists at the Japan Space Elevator Association are working seriously on the space-elevator project. Association spokesman Akira Tsuchida said his organization was working with U.S.-based Spaceward Foundation and a European organization based in Luxembourg to develop an elevator design. The Liftport Group in the U.S. is also working on developing a design, and in  total it's believed that more than 300 scientists and engineers are engaged in such work around the globe. NASA is holding a $4 million Space Elevator Challenge to encourage designs for a successful space elevator. Tsuchida said the technology driving the race to build the first space elevator is the quickly developing material carbon nanotube. It is lightweight and has a tensile strength 180 times stronger than that of a steel cable. Currently, it is the only material with the potential to be strong enough to use to manufacture elevator cable, according to Tsuchida. \"At present we have a tether which is made of carbon nanotube, and has one-third or one-quarter of the strength required to make a space elevator. We expect that we will have strong enough cable in the 2020s or 2030s,\" Tsuchida said. He said the most likely method of powering the elevator would be through the carbon nanotube cable. So, what are the major logistical issues keeping the space elevator from being anything more than a dream at present? Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics and astronautics Professor Jeff Hoffman said that designing the carbon nanotube appeared to be the biggest obstacle. \"We are now on the verge of having material that has the strength to span the 30,000 km ... but we don't have the ability to make long cable out of the carbon nanotubes at the moment.\" he said. \"Although I'm confident that within a reasonable amount of time we will be able to do this.\" Tsuchida said that one of the biggest challenges will be acquiring funding to move the projects forward. At present, there is no financial backing for the space elevator project, and all of the Japanese group's 100-plus members maintain other jobs to earn a living. \"Because we don't have a material which has enough strength to construct space elevator yet, it is difficult to change people's mind so they believe that it can be real,\" he said. Hoffman feels that international dialogue needs to be encouaraged on the issue. He said a number of legal considerations also would have to be taken into account. \"This is not something one nation or one company can do. There needs to be a worldwide approach,\" he said. Other difficulties for space-elevator projects include how to build the base for the elevator, how to design it and where to set up the operation. Tsuchida said some possible locations for an elevator include the South China Sea, western Australia and the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean. He said all of those locations usually avoided typhoons, which could pose a threat to the safety of an elevator. \"As the base of space elevator will be located on geosynchronous orbit, [the] space elevator ground station should be located near the equator,\" he said. Although the Japanese association has set a time frame of the 2030s to get a space elevator under construction -- and developments are moving quickly -- Hoffman acknowledges that it could be a little further away than that. \"I don't know if it's going to be in our lifetime or if it's 100 or 200 years away, but it's near enough that we can contemplate how it will work.\" Building a space elevator is a matter of when, not if, said Hoffman, who believes that it will herald a major new period in human history. \"It will be revolutionary for human technology, and not just for space travel. That's why so many people are pursuing it,\" he said. \"This is what it will take to turn humans into a space-bearing species.\"", "fa106f672b0243aa55be2691a3f8da228a34a9c4": "(CNN Student News) -- Record the CNN Special Investigations Unit Classroom Edition: Busted! Mortgage Meltdown when it airs commercial-free on Monday, October 6, 2008, from approximately 4:10-- 5:00 a.m. ET on CNN. (A short feature begins at 4:00 a.m. and precedes the program.) Program Overview . Home loans gone bad are wrecking the U.S. economy. CNN teams up with Fortune Magazine's Andy Serwer to investigate how the housing boom went bust. The fallout begins on Wall Street, where billions of dollars in American mortgages were bought, bundled and sold around the world. CNN takes the high-stakes mortgage game to Delmonico's, a Wall Street institution since 1837, where the likes of J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie once wheeled and dealed. Host Andy Serwer plays dealer and invites a few experts to face off on the mortgage crisis. Guest players include New York Times columnist and Princeton economist Paul Krugman, CNN's Personal Finance Editor Gerri Willis, securities guru Janet Tavakoli, investment strategist Peter Dunay and mortgage broker Jon Shibley. Grade Levels: 11-12, College . Subject Areas: Business, Economics, Finance, Social Studies, Life Skills . Objectives: . The CNN Special Investigations Unit Classroom Edition: Busted! Mortgage Meltdown and its corresponding discussion questions and activity challenge students to: . Curriculum Connections . Economics America National Standards . Standard 10 : Role of Economic Institutions . Students will understand that: Institutions evolve in market economies to help individuals and groups accomplish their goals. Banks, labor unions, corporations, legal systems, and not-for-profit organizations are examples of important institutions. A different kind of institution, clearly defined and enforced property rights, is essential to a market economy. Standard 16 : Role of Government . Students will understand that: There is an economic role for government in a market economy whenever the benefits of a government policy outweigh its costs. Governments often provide for national defense, address environmental concerns, define and protect property rights, and attempt to make markets more competitive. Most government policies also redistribute income.

Suggested Activity . Point out to students that one of the best ways for them to prepare for homeownership is to arm themselves with knowledge, and that the purpose of this activity is to help them obtain this information. Group students and instruct each group to prepare a PowerPoint presentation on the top ten things that first-time homebuyers should know before they shop for a mortgage. Groups may want to include information that addresses these points: . Have groups deliver their presentations to the class. If possible, invite a realtor or mortgage broker to attend the presentations and discuss the guidelines that are used to determine whether or not a homebuyer can afford a home. Extension . Following the presentations, direct students to print and online resources to identify homes that are for sale in their community, as well as the current interest rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage, a 15-year fixed mortgage and a 5/1 ARM. Next, have each student select a house and use an online amortization schedule calculator to determine what the monthly payment (principle + interest) would be for each type of loan, assuming that the loan was for 80% of the purchase price of the home. Instruct students to identify the potential benefits and drawbacks of each type of loan, and to select the loan type that they feel would be the best choice for the homebuyer. Then, have each student determine the salary that he or she thinks a person would need to earn to afford the monthly mortgage payments. After students share their research, ask: .

Pardee and Helen N. Pardee Professor of Economics and Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of \"Golden Fetters: the Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919-1939.\" Barry Eichengreen says strong action should be taken to stop the financial crisis from getting worse. BERKELEY, California (CNN) -- Every time the economy and stock market turn down, financial historians get predictable calls from reporters. Could this be the start of another Great Depression? Could \"it\" possibly happen again? My stock answer has always been no. The Great Depression resulted from a series of economic and financial shocks -- the end of a housing bubble in 1926 and the end of a high-tech bubble in 1929 -- but also from truly breathtaking neglect and incompetence on the part of policymakers. It couldn't happen again precisely because policymakers know this history. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is a student of the Great Depression. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson remembers the mistakes of Andrew Mellon, Herbert Hoover's treasury secretary. We can be confident, I always answered, that there will not be another Great Depression because policymakers have read financial histories like mine. At least that was my line until recently. Now I have stopped taking reporters' calls. The first thing that made the Great Depression great, of course, was the Fed's failure to act. It basically stood by as the banking system and the economy collapsed around it. This time, in contrast, the Fed can hardly be criticized for inaction. Not only has it cut rates, but it has rolled out one new unprecedented initiative after another. Unfortunately, it has reacted more than acted. First, it provided funds to the commercial banks. Then, it targeted broker-dealers. Now, it is desperately propping up the commercial paper market. All the while however, the problem has been infecting new parts of the financial system. One thing that restrained the Fed in the 1930s was the fear that rate cuts might cause capital to flee to other countries and the dollar to crash. The danger was that the same liquidity that the Fed poured in through the top of the bucket might just leak back out through these holes in the bottom. There was a solution: coordinated rate cuts here and in Europe. Unfortunately, central bankers couldn't agree on what was needed. The result was further instability. That central banks have learned this lesson of history and now see the need for coordinated action is at least one ground for hope. The problem is that they have already used their bullets. iReport.com: What lessons have your family passed down from the Great Depression? U.S. Treasury bill rates have essentially fallen to zero, and the Fed's policy interest rates are only slightly above that level. Central banks are out of ammunition. This is no longer a problem they can solve by themselves. What is needed now is Treasury action to address what has morphed into a global banking crisis. Between 1930 and 1933, not just the U.S. but also Europe and Latin America experienced rolling banking crises. When Austria took desperate measures to prop up its banking system, its banking crisis only shifted to Germany. When Germany did the same, the crisis spread to the United States. This was beggar-thy-neighbor policy at its worst. We have seen some disturbing evidence of the same in recent weeks, as when Ireland unilaterally guaranteed all bank deposits and thereby sucked funds out of the British banking system. G7 leaders, when they meet in Washington at the end of this week, need to explain exactly how they will address this aspect of the problem. They need to commit money to recapitalizing their banking systems -- now, and not next week. The U.K., which has just announced a $50 billion plan for bank recapitalization, has shown how this can be done in a matter of days. But a coordinated initiative will require the U.S. to put up a considerably larger sum. My recommendation would be to abandon the idea of reverse auctions for toxic assets and instead use the $700 billion of the recently passed rescue plan for bank recapitalization. Although the Great Depression started in 1929, it took until 1933 for American leaders to grasp this nettle and recapitalize the banks. We can't afford to wait for years this time around. A final thing that made the Great Depression such a catastrophe was that some of the worst shocks occurred right before the 1932 presidential election. There then followed an extended interregnum between the election and inauguration of the new president when no one was in charge. The outgoing president, Hoover, asked his successor designate, Franklin Roosevelt, to cooperate with him on joint statements and policies, but FDR refused to do so. Meanwhile, the banking crisis deepened. Corporations failed. The economy was allowed to spiral downward. It was this disaster that led us to amend the constitution to shorten the time between presidential election and inauguration from 4 to 2\u00bd months. The implication is clear. The two presidential candidates should be assembling their financial SWAT teams now. Paulson should promise that they will be invited into his office on November 5. This problem cannot wait until Inauguration Day.

Apache attack helicopters are part of the $6.4 billion weapons deal between the U.S. and Taiwan. Officials announced last week an intention to sell $6.4 billion in arms to Taiwan, though the deal still needs to be approved by Congress. Maj. Stewart Upton said the sale does not violate the Taiwan Relations Act, which allows the United States to provide Taiwan with items for self-defense . Taiwan split from the Chinese mainland in 1949 and the United States has vowed to support them if China initiates an unprovoked attack. The arms deal comes at a time when the United States needs China in negotiations over Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs. \"The Chinese reaction is unfortunate and results in missed opportunities,\" Upton said. \"We feel that the global security environment calls for U.S. and [Chinese] officials to maintain close relations to address common security challenges.\" The \"bilateral events\" China called off or postponed involve \"senior level visits and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief exchanges\" scheduled to happen by the end of November, he said. The Chinese ambassador was said to be on his way to the State Department Monday afternoon to protest the proposed weapons sale to Taiwan. One U.S. official said the tension with China will not affect the role China is playing in negotiations with Iran or North Korea over its nuclear program. The official declined to speak for attribution because of the sensitive diplomacy involved. The arms deal package includes a variety of U.S.-made weapons systems, including Patriot III anti-missile system, Apache attack helicopters, Harpoon missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles.", "d463d8f24afc6ebfaf07a04529243d5acc281a8f": "(CNN) -- On Tuesday, America elected its first black president, Barack Obama. But what does Obama's sweeping victory mean for the United States? Bill Maher is the host of \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" which airs on Friday nights on HBO. Bill Maher has the answer to that, and other questions -- including why he wants President George W. Bush to stay at home for the next 76 days. Maher, the host of HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" and the star of the current film \"Religulous,\" was a guest on Wednesday's \"Larry King Live.\" He talked with CNN's King about Sarah Palin's future, George W. Bush's past and the impact of GOP adviser Karl Rove. The following is an edited version of that interview. Larry King: Were you ever -- I don't want to use the word scared -- were you ever worried last night? Bill Maher: Why? What happened? (LAUGHTER) I think, you know, we all had this paranoid feeling like we're Charlie Brown and they're going to snatch the football away again. So, you know, until about when he won Pennsylvania, that's when it started to look pretty good for the people who were for him. King: What does this election say to you, Bill? Maher: I think that the lesson of the election is that the old America that Sarah Palin was saying was the real America, the small town, \"Joe the Plumber,\" white America, that's still out there. But the other America, the more diverse, liberal America, has edged it out. And maybe that's the real America now.  Watch King and Maher talk about the election \u00bb . King: Is Karl Rovism dead? Maher: Never. Negative campaigning, mudslinging, tearing people down -- that will always be in vogue. McCain did make a classy speech last night. But, you know, they all make a classy speech when they lose. What else can you do? And it does ring a little less true when only a day before you're calling the guy a socialist, a communist, a terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American. Oh, we lost? He's a great guy. Forget what I said yesterday. Let's all get behind the guy I just said was a communist. Please. King: Did the McCain campaign -- I know you admired him in the past -- did it disappoint you? Maher: Terribly. I think it even disappointed the people who were voting for him. I sensed something in conservatives reacting to the election yesterday. Even the ones who voted for McCain, they sort of were relieved. I sensed that. It was like, yes, I guess I kind of had to pull the lever for McCain, but secretly a part of me knew that this country needed a breath of fresh air, needed a new kind of president, a new kind of politics, a new face, a smart guy, a flexible guy, a supple leader. King: Is Gov. Palin the new star of the Republican Party? Maher: If they're not very bright, she is. I mean, that's going to be the gut check for the Republicans ... what direction are they going to go in now? Now, I think politicians are usually led by the idea that they want to win elections. And Sarah Palin was a bit of an Alaskan albatross around John McCain's neck -- not that he would have won anyway. King: You said you don't want President Bush meeting with any more foreign leaders between now and the inauguration. Why? Maher:: Because I don't trust him. He's got 76 days left to pull off one more giant screw-up and I don't think it's beyond him. I mean, the man does have a track record, Larry. You know, I keep saying it, but I don't think this man will be happy until he leaves the White House smoldering behind him as he walks back to Texas. King: You recently issued one of your new rules decreeing that Obama must give comedians something to work with. Any suggestions? Maher: No. It's very difficult. We have been spoiled, first with Bill Clinton and then George Bush. And here's a president now who -- he's not stupid. He's not angry. He's not a phony. He's not fat. He's not cheating on his wife. Who needs a jerk like that around for the next four years? Come on. (LAUGHTER) But look, he's going to be the president and we're going to have to get over our nervousness about making fun of a black person. He's not a black person. He's the president. King: So then you must want Gov. Palin to stay around, comedically. Maher: I do and she will. I think what people did not understand about Gov. Palin was that she campaigned for that job. She wanted it. She lobbied for it. She's a very ambitious person. And, of course, she's a super religious person. So she believes that God chose her for this job. I guess -- I guess God had a bad night yesterday, because she didn't get it. But, you know, the Lord works mysterious ways, as we know. So maybe he's saving her for next election or the next after that. She's only 44 years old. I mean she could be on the public stage for the next 30 years.", "45e92b1bd1e92b46df0627f40f85228bfc210afe": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Ten South African ministers and the deputy president have resigned as President Thabo Mbeki prepares to leave office. South African President Thabo Mbeki announced his resignation in a televised address Sunday. His replacement, African National Congress Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe, will be sworn in as South Africa's president Thursday. Mbeki announced he was resigning on Sunday, prompting threats from several Cabinet members to follow suit -- but the outgoing president urged them to stay in office, government sources said. The resignations, which include Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota, will take effect Thursday when Mbeki steps down, a government statement said. \"All the ministers have expressed their availability to assist the incoming administration in the hand-over process and any other assistance that might be sought from them,\" the statement said. The finance minister's assistant told CNN that Manuel is willing to serve in the new government, if needed. Three deputy ministers have also tendered their resignations, a government statement said. A spokesman for South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress, confirmed that it has named Motlanthe as its choice to succeed Mbeki. Motlanthe will stay in office until elections in the spring of next year, which ANC President Jacob Zuma is widely expected to win. Earlier this month, the ANC asked Mbeki to step down after a judge threw out the corruption, fraud and racketeering case against Zuma -- Mbeki's political arch rival. The judge called the case invalid and accused Mbeki's government of political interference. Mbeki -- who has been South Africa's president for nearly 10 years -- spoke of some of his achievements when he formally announced his resignation on Sunday during a televised address.  Watch the significance of Mbeki \"falling on the sword\" \u00bb . \"I depart this office knowing that many men and woman in South Africa have worked to achieve better lives for all,\" Mbeki said. Under his leadership the country has had the longest period of sustained economic growth in the South Africa's history and has reached out to indigent people in an unprecedented way, Mbeki said. Mbeki said the country still has economic, corruption and crime challenges to face in the future. And he gave his vote of confidence to the country's next leader without naming who that leader would be. Gwede Mantashe, secretary-general of the African National Congress, announced Saturday that the party -- which Mbeki has been involved with since his teens -- had asked him to leave before his term was up. Mbeki agreed to do so, he said. Mantashe said the ANC made the decision \"for the citizens of South Africa, so there could be stability within the country\" and so the ANC movement could remain \"stable and unified.\" The case against Zuma -- who replaced Mbeki as ANC president last year -- was thrown out in September 2006, but the National Prosecuting Authority recharged him. Judge Chris Nicholson made no ruling on Zuma's guilt or innocence, and he could be recharged. Political observers doubted that would happen because of Zuma's popularity, particularly with the Communist Party and trade unions. Zuma has denied the charges. He said the case was politically motivated, and harmed his chances to become the ANC's presidential nominee. He could have faced at least 15 years in jail if convicted of accepting bribes from a company that got a contract in a multibillion-dollar arms deal. He also faced charges of having a corrupt relationship with his former financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, who is serving a 15-year sentence for soliciting bribes for Zuma and using Zuma's political influence to benefit his businesses. Mbeki, 66, succeeded Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president in June 1999. Critics alleged he pushed for the corruption charges against Zuma. Mbeki recently brokered a power-sharing deal between Zimbabwe's political rivals, who signed the agreement on Monday in an effort to put aside the violent past and end the crisis that has paralyzed Zimbabwe since disputed national elections in March. Under it, longtime Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe remains president, while his perennial rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, has become prime minister and the coordinator of government affairs.", "b1065861c98843512e6f78bbab7e990c4ab37856": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama will undergo a routine medical examination at a hospital in the Indian capital on Tuesday, his spokesman Tenzin Taklha told CNN Sunday.

A police statement about the teenage boy's death said the incident started when six young protesters pelted a police patrol car with stones. The teen was shot as he tried to throw a petrol bomb at the officers, police said. Other angry teens converged on the site almost immediately. Fighting between youths and police erupted elsewhere, including Thessaloniki, the country's second-largest city. Hundreds of young people took to the streets of the sprawling port city, finally barricading themselves behind the gates of a state university. Authorities have been barred from entering university grounds since tanks crushed a 1973 student uprising protesting the ruling military junta. It was not clear what authorities would do about the demonstrators still holed up at the university. No deaths have been reported since Saturday.

The agents executed a criminal search warrant at 9 a.m. at the Columbia Farms poultry processing plant, capping a 10-month investigation into the plant's employment practices, said Barbara Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. About 58 of those arrested were allowed to return to their homes to take care of their children or for other humanitarian reasons, she said. The others were to be held in an ICE detention facility in the area. \"They are all illegals,\" Gonzalez said. \"We have charged them with being in violation of U.S. immigration laws.\" The investigation has already resulted in criminal charges being filed against 11 supervisors and a human resources manager, she said.  Maria Juan, 22, was one of about 50 relatives and friends of workers who huddled at the edge of the plant after the raid, some weeping and others talking frantically on cell phones, The Associated Press reported.  She was seeking information about her 68-year-old grandmother, a legal immigrant from Guatemala who went to work without identification papers but was later released, the AP reported.  \"Families are going to be broken apart,\" Juan told the AP. \"There will be kids and babies left behind. Why are they doing this? Why? They didn't do anything. They only wanted to work.\" No one from Columbia Farms or from its parent company, House of Raeford Farms in Raeford, North Carolina, responded immediately to telephone messages.  The Charlotte Observer newspaper first reported in February that plant workers were in the country illegally and company managers knew it, the AP reported. The raid \"is a drop in the bucket\" that is unlikely to persuade anyone in the United States illegally to go home, said Dan Kowalski, an Austin, Texas-based lawyer specializing in immigration law. He questioned the conclusion by Gonzalez and ICE that all of those arrested are indeed illegal immigrants.  \"A judge has to say that, they can't just say that,\" he said.", "13df0950ae828be40b1cb0192479dd2199ea96ad": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Blake Mycoskie is the founder and \"chief shoe giver\" of TOMS Shoes, a company that matches every pair of shoes it sells with a free pair to an impoverished child. Blake Mycoskie started TOMS Shoes in 2006. The company is committed to giving free shoes to poor children around the world. CNN caught up with the 32-year-old entrepreneur to talk about the inspiration behind his revolutionary business and what he has planned next. CNN: Tell us about the TOMS model. Mycoskie: The TOMS initiative is very simple: For every pair of shoes we sell, we give a pair away. When we know that say, we're going to sell 10,000 pairs this spring, we make another 10,000 to be given away. CNN: Where did you get the idea to start TOMS? Mycoskie: I decided to go back to some of the places that my sister and I had visited on \"The Amazing Race.\" [Mycoskie and his sister participated in the reality TV show in 2002.] . I found myself going on to Argentina. I went to some of the villages and it was one of the defining moments of my life when I saw these kids not wearing shoes. That's where I kind of had this 'ah ha' moment. I started thinking, what if I started a business where every time I sold a pair of shoes, I would guarantee that customer that I would give another pair to someone who does not have shoes? CNN: How did you pursue your vision? Did you have any experience as a designer or shoemaker? Mycoskie: I had absolutely no experience in shoes or fashion so I approached the business how I have done everything in my life, and that's with reckless ambition. There were a lot of really cool styles of shoes in Argentina that we did not have in the United States so I picked one of them, the alpargata, and I started figuring out how to make shoes. CNN: Did you expect the company to be a big success when you launched? Mycoskie: I was not really looking to make any money on the deal. I wanted to be able to sell the shoes for enough money to give away another pair and to hire one or two people to administer it and keep it going once I went back to work. But what I found was that not only did people find this concept just very intriguing - from a fashion perspective, people loved these shoes. All of a sudden I started selling in the top boutiques. CNN: When did you realize that TOMS was going to be much more than a small project? Mycoskie: I think the crowning moment was when Vogue magazine called and that was a few months after we started. That was when I was really like, 'Wow, this is not just some small little shoe philanthropy that I have created.' This could be a real business and it could be a real player in the fashion industry and it could really set a tone for how fashion companies could give back. CNN: Has philanthropy always been a priority for you? Mycoskie: I always thought that I would spend the first half of my life making money so I can spend the second half of my life giving it all away. And one of the defining moments of my life was when I realized that I could do both at the same time with TOMS. CNN: What are some of your proudest achievements? Mycoskie: One thing that is most unique about TOMS and I think that I'm most proud of is that every single pair [of shoes] is hand placed onto a child's foot. CNN: How has TOMS evolved since you started it in 2006?

CNN: Tell us about the process of producing TOMS. Mycoskie: A very big passion of mine and that of the people that run our production is finding factories that have fair labor practices and treating them more like partners in our family than people just who are going to produce for us. One of the things we have always done with all of our factories is I personally visit them and we actually show our documentary film about what we do. When you connect with the factory like that, everything goes much better. CNN: You've called yourself a serial entrepreneur. Do you have another business in the pipeline? Mycoskie: I can honestly say that TOMS is my future. I mean I have no desire to start any other company for as long as I live because this is the perfect blend of business and philanthropy to me. CNN: What's next for TOMS? Mycoskie: The future of TOMS is really creating a whole new business model of this one-for-one giving and expanding the TOMS model from shoes into other products as well.

Armed militants pose next to a captured armored vehicle near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. But in a statement, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan said, \"We do not expect any impact on ISAF's ability to carry out operations.\" The decision to suspend travel through the Khyber Pass in northwest Pakistan was taken due to security concerns, said Gula Jan, a security official in Khyber Agency, on Sunday. The mountain pass links Pakistan to its neighbor, Afghanistan. It is in the Khyber Agency, one of seven semiautonomous tribal agencies along the Afghan border. Because Afghanistan is landlocked, many supplies for NATO-led troops fighting Islamic militants there have to be trucked in from Pakistan. Officials said militants aligned with the Taliban and al Qaeda have carried several attacks there. The Pakistani central government has little control in the area, and the area is believed to be a haven for militants. On Tuesday, as many as 60 to 70 armed militants launched back-to-back assaults on convoys. The militants seized 13 trucks -- 12 carrying wheat into Afghanistan as part of a World Food Programme convoy, and one transporting Humvees to the U.S.-led coalition, Khyber Agency officials said. Jan said the decision to suspend travel came after local leaders met with representatives of some of the shipping firms. He said trucks will be allowed through the pass once the security situation improves, but did not specify a date. Dozens of trucks idled by the side of roads Sunday in the Khyber Agency and in Peshawar waiting for the green light. In its statement, ISAF said it has \"multiple, robust and complementary lines of support.\" It added that for security and geographical reasons, \"the movements of civilian convoys destined for ISAF are coordinated with Pakistani authorities and border crossing points. The current temporary adjustments in convoy movements are as a result of this coordination.\" CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.", "4261220f6fc10a0db80682e0d93cdb762a28b843": "(CNN) -- The Louisiana man who Saturday became the first Vietnamese-American elected to the House says he hopes his win will push more young people to become politically active.

Because as you can see, really anything can happen.\" The Republican defeated nine-term Democratic Rep. William Jefferson in the mostly African-American and heavily Democratic New Orleans-area district. Jefferson had been expected to win a 10th term despite battling scandals and a federal indictment for the past three years. The contest, which drew a light turnout, was delayed until Saturday after Hurricane Gustav swept through southern Louisiana in late August. Had the vote been held during the November 4 general election, Jefferson -- who is black -- may have benefited from the heavy African-American voter turnout for Barack Obama. Cao conceded that low voter turnout aided his victory. \"We were hoping for a low turnout because it would provide us with the greater chance of winning,\" said Cao, a lawyer and community activist. \"Based on the demographics of the district, a high voter turnout would have gone to our disadvantage.\" Cao also may have been helped by the scandal that has plagued Jefferson. Jefferson, who pleaded not guilty to 16 criminal counts of racketeering, bribery, money laundering and obstruction of justice, denies any wrongdoing. In 2005, Jefferson's private homes in Washington and New Orleans were raided, and FBI agents say they found $90,000 in cash stashed in one of his freezers. Officials say the money was part of a payment in marked bills from an FBI informant in a transaction captured on videotape. Jefferson also is accused of soliciting and receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes for himself and his family in exchange for promoting their products and services to countries in Africa. Cao said he came to the United States at the age of 8 after his family fled Vietnam as it fell to communists. \"When I [was] 9 years old, I received a letter from my father while he was in the re-education camp,\" Cao said. \"He told me to study hard, to work hard and to give back to your country and to your community.

Holli Chmela, 27, and her male companion, Taylor Luck, 23, arrived in Lebanon on September 29 from Amman, Jordan, the embassy said. They left Beirut on October 1, telling friends they were headed for the northern Lebanese cities of Byblos and Tripoli that day.

A gay couple is married in California in June. Voters could void same-sex marriages in the state in November. The court on Wednesday denied a petition to remove the initiative from the state's general election ballots. The unanimous decision was handed down without elaboration. Hundreds of marriage licenses have been issued to same-sex couples since mid-June, a month after the court overturned the state's laws against such unions. However, on June 2, opponents of same-sex marriage filed for a ballot initiative that would ban such marriages in the state's constitution. Such a ban would overturn the court's May ruling. Equality California, a Sacramento-based activist group, filed a petition against the initiative -- Proposition 8 -- arguing that it involves a constitutional revision that can't be adopted through a ballot vote. The group also contended that petitions circulated to qualify the proposition for the ballot contained material that misled readers about the measure's effects. Jennifer Kerns, a spokeswoman for the proposition, called Wednesday's decision \"a huge victory.\" \"We believe it deals a strong blow to our opponents and sends a strong message that they won't be able to keep the ballot initiative away from the people of California,\" she said. Calls Wednesday to Equality California were not immediately returned. If the proposition is approved, it would be the second time same-sex marriages have been voided in California. In February 2004, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom -- who is considering a run for governor -- challenged the state's laws against same-sex marriage, ordering city officials to issue marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples. Those unions were voided by the California Supreme Court, though the justices sidestepped the issue of whether banning same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, allowing legal cases to work their way through the lower courts. Several gay and lesbian couples -- along with the city of San Francisco and gay-rights groups -- sued, saying they were victims of unlawful discrimination. A lower court ruled San Francisco had acted unlawfully in issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. However, the state Supreme Court's ruling in May struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional. That decision made California the nation's second state, after Massachusetts, to legalize same-sex marriage. Four other states allow civil unions.", "eb6d830336b33fa16f030ce9a205ff8a52796ee1": "TBLISI, Georgia (CNN) -- As Georgian troops launched a major military offensive Friday to regain control over the breakaway province of South Ossetia, the former Soviet republic's president accused Russia of bombing its territory. Georgian troops fire rockets at seperatist South Ossetian troops from an unnamed location not far from Tskhinvali. According to the Associated Press, Mikhail Saakashvili said in a televised statement that Russian aircraft bombed several Georgian villages and other civilian facilities. He said there were injuries and damage to the buildings. \"A full-scale aggression has been launched against Georgia,\" he said in a televised statement. A Georgian official said seven people were hurt in the attack, AP reported. Saakashvili urged Russia to immediately stop bombing Georgian territory. \"Georgia will not yield its territory or renounce its freedom,\" he said. Meanwhile, AP reported that Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, speaking in televised remarks Friday during his trip to the opening of the Beijing Olympics, blamed Georgia for launching the effort to take control over South Ossetia and warned it would cause an unspecified retaliatory action.  Watch more about the increased violence in Georgia \u00bb . The bombing charge came about an hour after Russia's ambassador to the United Nations brushed off a question about whether Russia would intervene militarily in a conflict between Georgia and its breakaway territory. Violence in the former Soviet republic prompted an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council that lasted into Friday morning. The security council failed to issue a statement on the dramatic escalation of violence in a breakaway territory of the former Soviet republic of Georgia. Meanwhile, Georgia's president also announced that his government will be calling up reservists as fighting continued to rage in South Ossetia's capital. Georgian forces launched fresh attacks into region late Thursday after a top government official said a unilateral cease-fire offer was met with artillery fire. About 2,000 Georgian troops attempted to storm the breakaway territory's capital overnight and were regrouping south of the city, Tskhinvali, according to Russia's ITAR-TASS news agency. Georgia's ambassador to the United Nations, Irakli Alasania, said that \"Russia has become a party to the conflict.\" He said Russia has supported separatists in South Ossetia, a charge Russia dismissed. Around 10 a.m. Friday, Georgia said Russian military aircraft violated Georgian airspace and dropped two bombs on Kareli, a part of Georgia that is about 50 miles northwest of the capital, Tblisi, and is not in the conflict zone, said Shota Utiashvili, spokesman for the Georgian Ministry of Interior. No casualties were reported, he said. Georgian troops pushed into South Ossetia after separatists attacked Georgian soil, destroying one village and killing several civilians, soldiers and police officers, Alasania said. Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, denied allegations that his country planned to intervene militarily. In comments to the Security Council, he decried the \"blatant aggressive action of Georgia.\" The latest developments follow a week of sporadic clashes between the Georgian central government and authorities in South Ossetia, which declared its independence from Georgia in the early 1990s after a bloody ethnic conflict between Georgians and Ossetians. Alexander Lomaia, the secretary of Georgia's National Security Council, said his country had to act. \"The objective of the operation is to protect the civilian population, to ensure their security and then convince the separatists that there is not a military solution to this conflict,\" he said. Lomaia said Georgian troops were responding proportionately to separatist mortar and artillery attacks on two villages -- attacks he said followed a Thursday evening cease-fire and call for negotiations by Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili. \"There were up to 10 people killed, including peacekeepers and the peaceful population, and up to 23 people wounded, including four of them wounded quite badly,\" Lomaia said. But he said Georgia wants a peaceful solution to the conflict and is leaving the door open to negotiations and has offered the territory \"the widest possible autonomy.\" The official news agency of the South Ossetian government reported heavy shelling in the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali, that left dozens of buildings ablaze. Lomaia said Georgian troops have no plans to reclaim control over the territory as part of the operation launched Thursday night -- but he said how far they advance \"is really dependent on how the situation evolves on the ground.\" \"Obviously, there will be a moment when we will be forced to respond, we will be forced to advance in order to prevent such bombardment,\" he said. \"But at the time being, there is no such aim of the operation.\" Georgia, located on the Black Sea coast between Russia and Turkey, has been split by Russian-backed separatist movements in South Ossetia and another region, Abkhzia. Neither region's government has international recognition. -- Journalist Elene Gotsadze contributed to this report.", "8bda9795dd01c1cd540743bd2677e13607760794": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Protests continued Friday in several California cities, including San Francisco, Palm Springs and Long Beach, over the passage of Proposition 8, which outlaws same-sex marriage. The passage of California's Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriages, has led to a number of protests. The ballot initiative, which passed 52.5 percent to 47.5 percent Tuesday, overturns a May ruling by the California Supreme Court that struck down a 2000 ban on same-sex unions. In San Francisco, an estimated 2,000 protesters marched down Market Street toward Dolores Park. The march stretched out for at least three city blocks, and the protesters completely blocked Market Street's westbound lanes and the eastbound lanes in places. \"I believe that politics and religion should be completely separate,\" protester Eric Rogers told CNN affiliate KGO-TV. \"This has been, actually, one of those lines that has been blurred by that.\" \"It really feels personal. It feels like why would someone not want us to live in love and respect,\" said protester Jayne Dean-McGilpin. A demonstration in Long Beach stretched out for five or six blocks. \"Hate is not hot,\" read a banner at the front of the marchers. About 2,000 demonstrators marched in a peaceful protest in Long Beach, and a few hundred remained in the streets around 10 p.m. (1 a.m. ET), said Sgt. David Marander of the Long Beach Police Department. Marander said Long Beach officers arrested three people after they tried to persuade others to leave the protest route that was described in a permit that organizers obtained for the march. At one point, demonstrators stopped at a street corner for a few moments to allow traffic to cross. Later, demonstrators congregated for about 20 minutes at the intersection of Broadway and Alameda Street, blocking traffic in all directions. The demonstrators then moved on before stopping at the intersection of Long Beach Boulevard and First Street, where many of them sat down in the street. After a few minutes, the demonstrators were on the move again. Police kept a watchful eye on the protesters but did not intervene. In Palm Springs, a crowd of several hundred gathered in front of the city hall, chanting \"Civil rights\" and \"Tax the Church.\" One sign read: \"We will not give up.\" iReport.com: Your thoughts on gay marriage? Several protesters surrounded an elderly looking woman, an apparent Proposition 8 supporter, and shouted at her. No arrests were reported at any of the demonstrations. In Salt Lake City, Utah, about 2,000 demonstrators gathered at Temple Square to protest against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Mormon church strongly supported Proposition 8, which amends California's constitution to define marriage as legal only between one man and one woman. Proposition 8 opponents say the Salt Lake City-based church donated a majority of the money raised in support of the measure. The LDS Church believes it should not be singled out when other groups also supported the proposition. \"It is disturbing that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is being singled out for speaking up as part of its democratic right in a free election,\" the church said in a statement Friday. On Thursday, Roman Catholic and Mormon leaders said their efforts did not target any specific group. The coalition of religious communities and citizens who supported Proposition 8 wanted to preserve \"the bedrock institution of marriage\" between a man and a woman, said Cardinal Roger Mahoney, the Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles. \"Proposition 8 is not against any group in our society,\" Mahoney said in a written statement. About 2,000 protesters picketed Thursday afternoon outside the Los Angeles temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Several groups have petitioned the California Supreme Court to prevent the constitutional revision from taking effect. The American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights have filed a lawsuit contending the ballot initiative was \"improperly used.\" According to the three groups, \"such radical changes\" as outlawing gay marriage cannot be made by ballot initiative, but must, \"at a minimum, go through the state legislature first.\" The groups also argue the measure takes away a \"fundamental right\" from lesbian and gay Californians. The three organizations filed the legal challenges on behalf of Equality California and six same-sex couples who did not marry before Tuesday's election, but would like to be able to wed now. The three groups contend that California must honor the marriages of the 18,000 lesbian and gay couples who have already married. Sunny Hostin, a CNN legal analyst, said Thursday it is unclear whether same-sex weddings that took place before Tuesday are still valid. Referring to those couples, she said, \"I think they really are in a legal limbo, a legal black hole.\" Voters in Arizona and Florida also banned same-sex marriages in ballot initiatives Tuesday.", "d191e20468fc7675fcfa55c33fab1e65405740a0": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's parliament speaker has criticized U.S. President-elect Barack Obama for saying that Iran's development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has outlined where he thinks U.S. policy needs to change. Ali Larijani said Saturday that Obama should apply his campaign message of change to U.S. dealings with Iran. \"Obama must know that the change that he talks about is not simply a superficial changing of colors or tactics,\" Larijani said in comments carried by the semi-official Mehr News Agency. \"What is expected is a change in strategy, not the repetition of objections to Iran's nuclear program, which will be taking a step in the wrong direction.\" In his first post-election news conference Friday afternoon, Obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be \"unacceptable.\" He also said he would help mount an international effort to prevent it from happening. Larijani said that U.S. behavior toward Iran \"will not change so simply\" but that Obama's election showed internal conditions in the United States have shifted. He added that Iran does not mind if the United States provides other Persian Gulf countries with nuclear technology, but \"you should know that you cannot prevent the Islamic Republic [from reaching its goals in the nuclear field],\" according to the news agency. Obama cautioned Friday that it had only been a few days since the election and that he was not in office. \"Obviously, how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is not something that we should simply do in a knee-jerk fashion. I think we've got to think it through,\" Obama said. \"But I have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time. And I want to be very careful that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that I am not the president, and I won't be until January 20th.\" Larijani was speaking two days after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad congratulated Obama, the first time an Iranian leader has offered such wishes to a U.S. president-elect since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. One analyst said the welcome was a gesture from the hard-line president that he is open to a more conciliatory relationship with the United States. Ahmadinejad said Tehran \"welcomes basic and fair changes in U.S. policies and conducts,\" according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency on Thursday. Relations between the United States and Iran have historically been chilly and have been further strained in recent years over Iran's nuclear program. Tehran insists that the program exists for peaceful purposes, but the United States and other Western nations are concerned by Iran's refusal to halt uranium enrichment activities.

About 200 victims of election violence seek safety outside the U.S. Embassy in Harare, Zimbabwe, this month. \"The new executive order significantly enhances our ability to designate individuals in and entities connected to the Mugabe regime,\" Bush said in a written statement that calls the Zimbabwean government under president Robert Mugabe \"illegitimate.\" Just after the announcement, the Treasury Department said it has designated for sanctions 17 entities, including three government-owned or controlled companies used by Mugabe and his government \"to illegally siphon revenue and foreign exchange from the Zimbabwean people,\" as well as one individual. \"This action is a direct result of the Mugabe regime's continued politically motivated violence, disregarding calls from the Southern African Development Community, the African Union and the United Nations to halt the attacks,\" the White House said. \"The regime has also continued its ban against NGO activities that would provide assistance to the suffering and vulnerable people of Zimbabwe. No regime should ignore the will of its own people and calls from the international community without consequences.\" The U.S. has been pushing for sanctions against Zimbabwe since Mugabe ignored a U.N. Security Council appeal to postpone a presidential runoff election June 27. The vote initially was intended to be a runoff between Mugabe and opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai, who did not win the presidency outright in the general election, according to government tallies. But Tsvangirai, of the Movement for Democratic Change, withdrew just before the vote, saying Mugabe's supporters had orchestrated a campaign of beatings, intimidation and murders against Tsvangirai supporters. Earlier this month, Russia and China vetoed a Security Council resolution pushed by the United States, Britain and France that would have imposed international sanctions on Mugabe and senior members of his government. Bush said last week he was \"displeased\" at the vetoes, but the Treasury and State Departments were working on potential U.S. action.

The Treasury Department said he is an Omani national who has close ties to Mugabe and his top officials and uses his company, Oryx Natural Resources, to \"enable Mugabe ... to maintain access to, and derive personal benefit from, various mining ventures in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Under the sanctions, any assets tied to al-Shanfari or to the designated companies that are within U.S. jurisdictions must be frozen, and people living in the United States are prohibited from doing business with them. On Monday, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed an agreement that paves the way for power-sharing talks to take place in the next few weeks. They will be mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki, as a representative of the Southern African Development Community, and Jean Ping, chairman of the African Union Commission. Bush said Friday the United States is ready to provide a \"substantial assistance package, development aid and normalization with international financial institutions\" should those talks result in a new government \"that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people.\" In the meantime, the president said he is authorizing the use of up to $2.5 million from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to assist Zimbabwean refugees and those displaced by the violence. In addition, he said the United States will continue efforts to provide food and medical care to Zimbabweans.", "918d65caaa78102cdbe0173b9aae1c182a79abfc": "(The Frisky) -- Despite the tough economic times, you can't just expect to stop lusting after those Frye riding boots you've had your eye on forever, or that your longtime trusted hair stylist is going to suddenly start cutting her prices. From hobbies to bake sales to your own Web site, there are ways to make extra money in your spare time. The fact is no matter how frugally you learn to live, there are still going to be some things you'll want to splurge on, and that's okay. I mean, this is a recession, after all, not a potato famine. You don't have to give up all your luxuries or switch to low-cost everything; you just have to get savvier about making extra money for those treats you enjoy. But I'm not talking about getting a second job or really working that much harder; a true recessionista knows how to make extra cash for little luxuries while leaving plenty of free time to enjoy them, too. After the jump, seven ways to make more money without taking a second job... 1. Become a focus group participant: An old co-worker turned me on to focus groups about 8 years ago and after I made 75 bucks giving my opinion on a series of coffee ads, I immediately went home, opened the phone book (remember those?), and called dozens of market research companies to get my name added to their databases for future groups. Over the years I've made thousands of dollars telling people what I think about ads, product concepts, packaging, services, and the taste of food and beverages. Once, I even made $200 tasting vodka for an hour. Talk about easy money! Check the \"Etc.\" section of Craigslist for current focus groups in your area, or do an online search for market research recruiting companies and then can call and have your name added to their databases. 2. Use your blog: If you have a blog -- and who doesn't these days? -- you're sitting on valuable real estate. Depending on the size of your readership, you could make anywhere from enough money to buy a magazine and a latte to enough to support your entire family (\u00e1 la Dooce). There are lots of different ways to make money on a blog, from virtual tip jars to product reviews, but the most popular is through running ads. In the past, I've recruited sponsors directly for a niche blog I used to write, but I currently use an advertising program on my personal blog that basically takes care of everything so all I have to do is post regularly and collect my check at the end of the month. Free money for writing about my cats and boyfriend and favorite TV shows! What could be easier? There are a host of ad programs open to anyone, so do your research to find one that's right for you. 3. Sell the stuff you no longer want: When I moved to New York from Chicago a year ago to be with my long-distance boyfriend, I used the opportunity to unload all the crap I no longer wanted or needed. I sold furniture, home goods, clothes, accessories, and my car (no need for one in Manhattan!). In addition to hosting a yard sale where I made about 200 bucks for candles, pots and pans and old Halloween costumes, I used the hell out of Craigslist and eBay, both before my move and after I arrived when I realized I still needed to unload quite a bit to fit into my boyfriend's one-bedroom apartment. I honestly don't miss anything I got rid of (and can't remember what most of it even was), and the money from the sales paid a big chunk of my moving costs. Now that I'm settled in, I like to go through my belongings each season, selling a few items and making room and money for new stuff, like dresses and cute shoes. 4. Make money from your hobbies: From hawking your crafts on Etsy, and selling produce from your garden, to playing piano once a week at a local restaurant, or reading tarot cards at a party, there are innumerable ways to make cash doing the activities you love. The key here is to convince yourself you have a product or skill someone else wants and then search out those people or companies who can pay you for them. 5. Host a bake sale: Remember when we were kids and our parents used to make cookies and brownies and stuff for school bake sales to raise money for a new flagpole or air conditioning in the gym? Well, why not do the same thing now that we're grown-ups and need to raise money for our vacations to Barcelona? I say get a few friends together, bake up a storm, and then sell your goods at a local market, a festival, or even online at a place like Etsy. If you love baking, this is another great way to make money from a hobby...without inhaling all the extra calories eating the goods yourself! 6. Shop and sell: What recessionista doesn't like shopping, right? So instead of giving it up or cutting back, start making money off your great eye and awesome buying skills. Whether you live in an area with fantastic sample sales, or a town with the best thrift and antique stores, chances are you're able to score stuff your recessionista sisters in other parts of the country can't. So make your next shopping spree a moneymaking one and sell your finds for a profit on eBay, or open a vintage shop on Etsy (can you tell I'm a fan of the site?). 7. Pet sit: If you know people with pets, volunteer to watch them -- for a small fee, of course -- the next time they leave town for a few days. Sure, they could kennel them or hire a professional, but most people feel better when they leave their beloved pets (not to mention their house keys) in the hands of someone they know and trust. And, hey, if they have cable and throw in a bottle of wine for your trouble, you'll score a bit of a vacation yourself...and make money for a pedicure, to boot.

With prices rising even more than once a day, shopping is a mathematical proficiency test for Zimbabweans. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe had capped maximum daily withdrawals at 500,000 Zimbabwean dollars -- about 25 U.S. cents, and about a quarter of the price of a loaf of bread. But faced with mounting chaos in a country already in economic free fall, the bank decided last week to raise that limit to 100 million dollars ($50 U.S.) per week. Soldiers were deployed to all banks in anticipation of throngs of people lining up to withdraw money Thursday, when the increase took effect. Wednesday, police chased depositors away and arrested union leaders who planned to protest the limits. Zimbabwe's inflation rate of 231 million percent is the world's highest. In addition, the country is faced with a growing outbreak of cholera that its government declared a national emergency Thursday. The outbreak has killed at least 565 people and sickened more than 11,000, the U.N. Humanitarian Affairs Office said. Medical professionals blame the resurgence of the water-borne disease on the lack of safe water in many parts of the country. The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions said 69 people were arrested across the country during Wednesday's demonstrations. Amnesty International has demanded to know the whereabouts of human rights activist Jestina Mukoko, whom it said was abducted at dawn Wednesday by armed men in plainclothes posing as police. And angry, unpaid soldiers clashed with foreign currency exchangers and some civilians Monday, three days after troops who had failed to get cash from their banks looted shops they suspected to be illegally dealing in foreign currency.", "dba09bf8d6e380add99a720940fa42be72cf95bd": "(CNN) -- What do Copernicus and a Britney Spears look-a-like have in common? Despite centuries separating the two, both have inspired greatness in Poland. Maxim named Joanna Crupa, a Polish/American model and actress, 61st in its 2006 Hot 100 list. Here we look at some of Poland's most famous nationals -- from years gone by to the present day. Many have influenced a world far beyond their country's boundary. Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) Copernicus was a mathematician, astronomer, physician, classical scholar, translator, Catholic cleric, jurist, governor, military leader, diplomat and economist. He is primarily known, however, for his theory that earth is not the center of the universe. His book, \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), is often regarded as the starting point of modern astronomy and the defining moment that began the Scientific Revolution. Copernicus was born in 1473 in Thorn. Thorn was a city in Prussia, an autonomous region in the old Kingdom of Poland. Frederick Chopin (Fryderyk Chopin) (1810-1849) Born in the village of Zelazowa Wola in Warsaw, to a Polish mother and French father, he was regarded early on as a child-prodigy piano virtuoso. He is generally considered to be Poland's greatest composer, and ranks as one of music's greatest tone poets. Always in fragile health, he died in Paris in 1849 from chronic pulmonary tuberculosis. He was only 39. Mari-Sklodowska (Marie Curie) (1867-1934) Marie Curie, a Polish physicist and chemist, is arguably the most famous female scientist. She was a pioneer in the field of radioactivity, the only person honored with Nobel Prizes in two different sciences, and the first female professor at the University of Paris. Her French husband Pierre Curie and both her daughter Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie and son-in-law Frederic Joliot-Curie were awarded a Nobel prizes. Marie Curie was born in Warsaw. In 1891 she moved to Paris to further her studies and work on scientific projects. She found the theory of radioactivity and also found two new elements, radium and polonium (the latter being named after her native Poland.) Karol Wojtyla (Pope John Paul II) (1920-2005) Karol J\u00f3zef Wojtyla was born on 18 May, 1920 in the Polish town of Wadowice. At only 58 years of age, he was the youngest pope elected since Pope Pius IX in 1846. He reigned as the 264th Pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 1978 until his death in 2005. His reign of over 26 years was the second-longest after Pius IX's 32-year reign. He has been the only Polish pope, and was the first non-Italian pope since the Dutch Adrian VI in the 1520s. The pope traveled extensively, visiting over 100 countries, more than any other pope and was fluent in numerous languages: Polish, Italian, French, German, English, Spanish, Croatian, Portuguese, Russian and Latin. He was the victim of several assassination attempts, but later said he forgave the perpetrators. He was chosen twice as person of the year by Time magazine. Andrzej Wajda (1926 - ) Wajda, born in Suwalki, Poland is an award-winning Polish film Director. He received an honorary Oscar in 2000. After the fall of communism in 1989, he was elected as a government senator while he continued his role as artistic director of Warsaw's Teatr Powszechny. His films often raise social awareness and have dealt with a number of subjects including war, communism and murder (based on the murder of his own father by the Soviets in 1940). Wajda married four times. He has one daughter and is currently married to actress Krystyna Zachwatowicz. Roman Raymond Polanski (1933 - ) Polanski is an Academy Award-winning and four-time nominated Polish film director, writer, actor and producer. After beginning his career in Poland, Polanski became a celebrated filmmaker and director of such films as Rosemary's Baby (1968) and Chinatown (1974). Recently Polanski has made acclaimed films such as the Academy Award-winning and Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or-winning The Pianist (2002), and Oliver Twist (2005). Polanski has a tragic personal history. He lived in Nazi-occupied Poland during the Second World War and was persecuted for being Jewish. He escaped death by hiding in a farmer's cow shed, while his mother was murdered in the infamous Nazi death camp at Auschwitz. After surviving the Holocaust and moving to the United States, Polanski married American actress Sharon Tate. In 1969, Tate, who was pregnant at the time, was murdered by serial killer Charles Manson's sect. In 1978, Polanski pleaded guilty in the United States to \"unlawful sexual intercourse\" with a 13-year-old girl. The director fled to France before sentencing. He now lives there and has French citizenship. He cannot return to the United States because he is likely to be imprisoned. Lech Walesa (1943 - ) A former President of Poland and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Walesa is often credited with changing the Polish political system. He founded the organization \"Solidarity,\" the country's first independent trade union, which was pivotal in bringing about the fall of the communist regime. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 for his human rights activism. In 1989, after the fall of the Soviet Union, he persuaded leaders from formerly communist parties to form the first non-communist coalition government. He was president of Poland from 1990 to 1995. In 2000, Walesa once again stood for the presidential election, but received very little support and subsequently announced his retirement. Joanna Krupa (1979 - ) Krupa is a Polish-American model and actress. Born in Warsaw, the daughter of hotelier Steven Krupa, she eventually moved with her family to the United States at the age of five. Krupa has appeared on various magazine covers including FHM, Personal, Inside Sport, Stuff, Steppin' Out, Teeze and Maxim, in which she was named the Sexiest Swimsuit Model in the World. Maxim named her 61st in its 2006 Hot 100 list. She was also voted German Maxim's Model of the Year 2004-2005. She posed nude in the July 2005 issue of Playboy and also did a nude photoshoot for animal rights group PETA. The advertisements all have \"I would rather go naked than wear fur\" as a motto. Krupa has been quoted as saying, \"There is nothing sexy about wearing something that is so obviously tied to senseless pain and killing.\" Robert Kubica (1984 - ) Born in Krakow, Kubica is the first Polish racing driver to compete in Formula One. Since 2006 he has driven for the BMW Sauber F1 team, promoted from test driver to race driver during the 2006 season. In June 2008, he achieved his maiden F1 victory at the Canadian Grand Prix, becoming the 99th F1 racer to win a Grand Prix. Dorota Rabczewska or \"Doda\" (1984 - ) Dorota Rabczewska, or Dorota Rabczewska-Majdan, is often nicknamed Doda or Doda Elektroda or \"the Polish Britney Spears.\" She was born in Ciechanow, and is one of the most famous and successful pop singers in Poland. Doda started her career at the age of 14 and became popular after her participation in a reality TV show \"Bar.\" In 2000, at the age of 16, Rabczewska became the vocalist of the Polish rock band Virgin. In December 2005 and October 2007, she posed nude for the Polish edition of Playboy Magazine. She also posed for CKM Magazine several times. Doda received a Superjedynka award on National Festival of Polish Song in Opole in 2006. In 2007, she left her record company, Virgin, to begin a solo career. Her first solo album was released in 2007 and was certified as gold on the day before its official release. In 2008, her album \"Diamond Bitch\" went double platinum after 60,000 copies of the album had been sold.", "a083028eb71f5aa4b9b65ac99591b149eb3b6a6a": "LONDON, England -- Extra-time goals from Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba gave Chelsea a 3-2  victory over Liverpool to send the London side into a Champions League final showdown against English Premier League rivals Manchester United, 4-3 on aggregate. Didier Drogba (right) and Frank Lampard both found the net as Chelsea secured their final place in Moscow. Lampard, playing his first game since the death of his mother last week, coolly slotted home a 98th-minute penalty and Drogba, who had opened the scoring in the first-half, sent Chelsea to the final in Moscow on May 21 with a timely second goal. Fernando Torres had given Liverpool hope with a second-half equaliser but they failed to finish the job and Chelsea made them pay in a pulsating extra period which also saw Ryan Babel grab a late consolation goal for the visitors. Drogba, who Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez had accused of being a 'diver' prior to the match, looked like a man on a mission to ram the Spaniards words down his throat. The Ivory Coast striker forced Jose Reina to turn his skidding 15-meter effort around the post in the fifth minute. Four minutes later, Liverpool put together their only meaningful move of the opening half when a quick Steven Gerrard pass put Fernando Torres in behind the Chelsea defense. However, the Spanish striker's first touch was not deft enough and although he bore down on Petr Cech, the Chelsea goalkeeper did well to close down his space and options. The wet conditions hampered both sides but it was Chelsea who mastered them quicker. In the 18th minute, Lampard despatched a delightful pass into the path of Drogba but the striker was a meter wide with his shot. Chelsea were in the ascendancy and their supremacy was underlined by Michael Essien's 20-meter effort which had to be collected by Reina at the foot of his right-hand post. Liverpool were struggling to keep pace with the home side and their worries increased when central defender Martin Skrtel was forced off with a knee injury in the 21st minute to be replaced by Sami Hyypia. Reina was forced to punch clear a long-range effort from Ballack but the goal Chelsea had threatened for most of the half arrived in style in the 33rd minute. The architect was England midfielder Lampard. He cleverly split the Liverpool defense to give Salomon Kalou the chance to run on and fire a shot that Reina could only palm into the path of the onrushing Drogba. The Ivorian does not miss such gifts and he sent a low drive fizzing into the net at the near post to give London side a 2-1 aggregate lead. Drogba, clearly hurt by Benitez's criticism of his 'diving', then ran the length of the half to celebrate his goal in front of the Liverpool manager. Chelsea's domination almost brought them a second four minutes before the interval but Michael Ballack's measured free-kick veered just the wrong side of the post. Dirk Kuyt almost hauled Liverpool back into the tie three minutes after the restart but his shot met the outstretched leg of Cech before Ashley Cole cleared. After Lampard's 53rd-minute volley was well held by Reina, Liverpool finally broke their goalscoring hoodoo when Yossi Benayoun carved out a chance for Torres. The Spaniard collected the ball in his stride just inside the penalty area before sliding it beyond the exposed Cech to make it 2-2 on aggregate -- the 64th-minute effort was Liverpool's first at Stamford Bridge in nine games under Benitez. Both sides sought a winner -- but the 90 minutes ended all-square and the contest went into extra-time. Liverpool almost snatched the lead within minutes of the restart but Hyypia's header fell wide of the post with Cech beaten. Chelsea then thought they had done enough when Essien sent a 15-meter effort into the net -- but it was rightly disallowed for offside. However, in the 98th minute, Ballack was brought down by Hyypia inside the box and referee Roberto Rosetti pointed to the spot. Lampard kept his composure to send Reina the wrong way and was in tears as he celebrated with his teammates near the corner flag. Worse was to come for Liverpool when substitute Nicolas Anelka got free on the right and pulled the ball back for Drogba to fire under Reina. An error from Cech gifted Babel a late goal from longe range but Chelsea held on to reach their first ever Champions League final. \"This is something amazing. I am really pleased for the club because we have been looking for this final for too long,\" said Drogba, who admitted that he was   \"disappointed\" by Benitez's pre-match comments. \"Benitez is a fantastic coach and I was a bit disappointed but I think he felt his team was not strong enough and Chelsea were going to beat them. \"I am just happy for my team and I don't want to think about others. It's not good for my image. I'm giving my best to put my team at the top and I think it's not fair but it's finished now.\" Benitez believed his side were in control when they handed Chelsea the initiative in extra-time. The Spaniard said: \"I thought we were very close. We played well in the second half but the third goal killed it. We had control of the game but missd two chances in extra-time.\" Benitez insisted he did not regret his criticism of Drogba, saying: \"I don't think so, when you play a semifinal in the Champions League I don't think you think about anything other than that.\" Chelsea manager Avram Grant admitted he was proud to have succeeded in beating Benitez's Liverpool in the Champions League last four -- something his  predecessor Jose Mourinho failed to manage. \"There is only one special one,\" he joked. \"But this was special against Liverpool. They are a fantastic team and Rafa played it tactically well. \"You need to be clever against him but we did it. We have created history and I am very proud we did it my way -- but I don't like to say 'I' because owner Roman Abramovich created this club. Grant, who has guided his team to a strong end-of-season charge on two fronts, also praised Lampard's efforts in trying times. \"Frank played very well and in my opinion was one of our key players today. It is not an easy thing. He gave everything to the team,\" added Grant.

Clockwise from top left: Sam Thomsen, 13; Josh Fennen, 13; Aaron Eilerts, 14; and Ben Petrzilka, 14. Josh Fennen, 13, Sam Thomsen, 13, Ben Petrzilka, 14 , and Aaron Eilerts, 14, were among 93 Boy Scouts who were chosen by their troop leaders to attend leadership training this week at the Little Sioux Scout Ranch outside Omaha, Nebraska. In addition to the deaths, 48 Scouts and staff members were injured. Friends on Thursday described the fallen Scouts as multitalented, dedicated teens whose enthusiasm for life was matched only by their passion for Scouting. Aaron Eilerts' best friend described him as a \"kindhearted\" person who took his commitment to Boy Scouts very seriously. \"He would do anything that you asked him to do,\" Colby Gochanour, told CNN's Larry King. \"He just helped people.\" As a member of the Humboldt Boy Scout Troop No. 108 in Eagle Grove, Iowa, Aaron used his own money to make pillowcases for hospital patients, Gochanour said. He tried to donate the pillowcases to hospitals during a family vacation to Memphis, where he visited the home of Elvis, one of his heroes, according to a story that was published in the Eagle Grove Eagle last year. Aaron extended the same dedication to making fleece blankets for the Humane Society, according to the Omaha World-Herald. \"He embodied everything Scouting stands for,\" Dawn Sievertsen, principal of Robert Blue Middle School in Eagle Grove, Iowa, told the newspaper. \"He would start these projects to earn badges, but took them very seriously and would continue them long after he earned the badge.\" People who knew Josh Fennen of Omaha said he used many of the skills he learned in Scouting in everyday life. \"We'd go hiking. He was a good hiker. He knew what to do, how to start fires and good with pocketknives,\" Josh's best friend, Jack Cormaci, told affiliate KETV. \"He'd always be there when you needed him, always playing outside.\" Jeff Alfrey, the principal at Andersen Middle School, where Josh recently finished eighth grade, described Josh as inquisitive and confident, with natural leadership qualities, according to the Omaha World-Herald. \"He was a good student, a hard worker, and he was always trying to be creative,\" Alfrey told the newspaper. Sam Thomsen, who was days away from his 14th birthday, divided his time among the Boy Scouts, sports, home-schooling and the Southwest Church of Christ, according to the Omaha World-Herald. Sam's Facebook page, where he last wrote, \"Sam is ready for a week in the great outdoors,\" lists his interests as Jesus, football, video games and the Roadrunners, a basketball team for home-schooled children, according to the newspaper. \"He was always just full-board with everything he did, whether it be church or Boy Scouts or sports,\" Dr. Jim White, pastor of Southwest Church of Christ, told Larry King. \"He always had a wonderful, engaging smile on his face.\" Ben Petrzilka, who just finished seventh grade at Mary Our Queen Catholic School, was remembered as kind and caring. \"He always gave it his best effort. It is a very devastating loss to the school,\" principal Kayleen Wallace told the newspaper. A candlelight vigil was scheduled for Thursday evening at the Durham Scout Center in Omaha, the Boy Scouts said.", "bf6f49b5fd09d942ab409bcda4938a0d61b081b6": "BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China has recalled two tainted leukemia drugs tied to \"adverse reactions\" in patients, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Sunday. The factories involved in the production of the tainted drugs have been closed for investigation. According to Xinhau, the State Food and Drug Administration and the Ministry of Health suspended the production, sale and usage of methotrexate and cytarabin hydrochloride, produced by Shanghai Hualian Pharmaceutical Co., on September 5. There is no indication the drugs in question were ever exported outside of China. On Friday, the two agencies issued a notice saying that vincristine sulfate was the culprit -- an anti-cancer medicine which had been mistakenly mixed with the leukemia drugs, causing leg pains and retention of urine -- Xinhua reported. The factories involved have been closed, while the cause is being investigated.

Bones were unearthed during a seven-month search at an ex-detention post in La Plata, Argentina, officials said. Searchers said they also found a wall with more than 200 bullet holes and an \"important quantity\" of spent ammunition shells on the ground nearby. In some cases, bullets were still lodged in the wall. The announcement was made Tuesday at a news conference by government officials and representatives of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team, better known as EAAF, the initials of its name in Spanish. A team of six professional anthropologists and support crew said it believed the remains were human, but it was unable to determine how many bodies the fragments represented. \"I ask the forgiveness of family members, because I can imagine what the mothers and all who are gathered here will feel, but what we are about to show is not to detail the genocide but so that we have proof for the trials that are to come,\" said Sara Derotier de Cobacho, secretary of human rights for Buenos Aires province. \"But let us not forget,\" she said in a statement, \"that behind every clandestine center there were the names of the repressors. ... So it is very important for all citizens to know those names.\" The detention center was among those used in Argentina during the country's \"Dirty War,\" which started in 1976 when a group of generals staged a coup and started a vicious crackdown against anyone considered a subversive. By the time civilian control of the government resumed in 1983, up to 30,000 Argentines had been abducted and taken to the secret government detention centers, where they were tortured and killed. They are widely called \"los desaparecidos,\" or \"the disappeared.\" Thousands more people were abducted and killed by right-wing dictatorships in other South American countries during the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in Chile and Uruguay. The bone fragments in Argentina were unearthed during a seven-month search at the former detention post in the city of La Plata, near Buenos Aires. In 25 years of searching, this was the first time that human remains were found at a former detention center, said Luis Fondebrider, president of the EAAF. \"We've worked throughout the country and have always found remains in cemeteries, never outside,\" Fondebrider said in the release. The conference was called, he said, because of the extraordinary nature of the find. \"We usually don't hold press conferences about our work or what we find,\" Fondebrider said. \"But we understand that the magnitude of what we have found where the Clandestine Center of Arana was located merits that sometimes we show partial results.\" The searchers determined that bodies had been burned inside graves along with tires, combustibles and other material, Fondebrider said. \"The possibilities of identifying some of these remains is low because of the state they are in,\" Fondebrider said. The searchers will start analyzing the remains next year and are working with two prominent forensic genetic laboratories that specialize in working with remains that are in poor condition, he said. Lending an official air to Tuesday's proceedings, Carlos Stornelli, minister of security for the province of Buenos Aires, and Pablo Buruera, mayor of La Plata, also attended the news conference. \"We are looking for the truth so we can attain justice and construct, from there, the memory of our 30,000 'desaparecidos,' \" Derotier said.", "60988aea27196b8bbbf468746dc3553d93163adf": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A few months ago, it seemed liked nothing could stop Iraqi sprinter Dana Hussain from representing her country in the upcoming Summer Olympics. Iraqi sprinter Dana Hussain was devastated to learn she could not participate in the Beijing Summer Olympics.

Hussain cried for hours after hearing the news, which arrived in the form of a letter to Iraqi officials. \"She hasn't stopped.

Emmanuelle Moreau, a spokeswoman for the International Olympic Committee, said it suspended Iraq's national Olympic Committee in June after the government removed elected officials and put in people the IOC didn't recognize. She said the IOC proposed to the Iraqi government that officials come to the organization's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, \"to discuss possible solutions.\" But she said they didn't respond. \"We're extremely disappointed with the situation. The athletes have been ill-served by the government in Iraq,\" she said. Moreau said Iraq missed a Wednesday deadline for the entry of athletes to compete in archery, judo, rowing and weightlifting.  Watch a historian discuss the Olympics in Iraq under Saddam Hussein \u00bb . She said there is a chance that track and field athletes could compete if the original committee is reinstated. The deadline for the track team to register is at the end of the month. The Games begin August 8. A former official from the disbanded Iraq Olympic Committee said the IOC's decision was justified because the government interfered with the national committee by suspending it. The former official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. He said he believed that the government suspended the committee out of \"jealousy.\" The national committee was making great strides, and the government, namely the Ministry of Youth and Sports, wanted control of it, he said. The seven Iraqi athletes who were to travel to China for the Games' start in August are disappointed by the decision, officials said. They include an archer, a weightlifter, a judoka, two rowers and two sprinters, one of whom is Dana Hussain. Her coach called the decision unfair and said he blames \"everyone\": the Iraqi government and the Iraqi and International Olympic committees.

Bones were unearthed during a seven-month search at an ex-detention post in La Plata, Argentina, officials said. Searchers said they also found a wall with more than 200 bullet holes and an \"important quantity\" of spent ammunition shells on the ground nearby. In some cases, bullets were still lodged in the wall. The announcement was made Tuesday at a news conference by government officials and representatives of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team, better known as EAAF, the initials of its name in Spanish. A team of six professional anthropologists and support crew said it believed the remains were human, but it was unable to determine how many bodies the fragments represented. \"I ask the forgiveness of family members, because I can imagine what the mothers and all who are gathered here will feel, but what we are about to show is not to detail the genocide but so that we have proof for the trials that are to come,\" said Sara Derotier de Cobacho, secretary of human rights for Buenos Aires province. \"But let us not forget,\" she said in a statement, \"that behind every clandestine center there were the names of the repressors. ... So it is very important for all citizens to know those names.\" The detention center was among those used in Argentina during the country's \"Dirty War,\" which started in 1976 when a group of generals staged a coup and started a vicious crackdown against anyone considered a subversive. By the time civilian control of the government resumed in 1983, up to 30,000 Argentines had been abducted and taken to the secret government detention centers, where they were tortured and killed. They are widely called \"los desaparecidos,\" or \"the disappeared.\" Thousands more people were abducted and killed by right-wing dictatorships in other South American countries during the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in Chile and Uruguay. The bone fragments in Argentina were unearthed during a seven-month search at the former detention post in the city of La Plata, near Buenos Aires. In 25 years of searching, this was the first time that human remains were found at a former detention center, said Luis Fondebrider, president of the EAAF. \"We've worked throughout the country and have always found remains in cemeteries, never outside,\" Fondebrider said in the release. The conference was called, he said, because of the extraordinary nature of the find. \"We usually don't hold press conferences about our work or what we find,\" Fondebrider said. \"But we understand that the magnitude of what we have found where the Clandestine Center of Arana was located merits that sometimes we show partial results.\" The searchers determined that bodies had been burned inside graves along with tires, combustibles and other material, Fondebrider said. \"The possibilities of identifying some of these remains is low because of the state they are in,\" Fondebrider said. The searchers will start analyzing the remains next year and are working with two prominent forensic genetic laboratories that specialize in working with remains that are in poor condition, he said. Lending an official air to Tuesday's proceedings, Carlos Stornelli, minister of security for the province of Buenos Aires, and Pablo Buruera, mayor of La Plata, also attended the news conference. \"We are looking for the truth so we can attain justice and construct, from there, the memory of our 30,000 'desaparecidos,' \" Derotier said.", "a885e9c07273094ac3bd8ba156012187205b25f5": "BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- A German cruise liner said Tuesday it plans to fly its passengers over the Gulf of Aden, instead of sailing them through, out of fear of pirate attacks in the region. U.S. Navy image of pirates operating off coast of Somalia in October this year. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises said all 246 passengers and most of the crew aboard the MS Columbus, currently at the start of an around-the-world cruise, will disembark at an undisclosed port, then fly to Dubai to continue their journey. The company called the move a precautionary measure. Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have shot up this year, with pirates staging increasingly bolder attacks on ever-bigger targets. So far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau. Freight and cargo ships, cruise liners, and private yachts have all come under attack. In many hijackings, pirates take the crew and passengers hostage while they demand a ransom. The problem has forced companies like Hapag-Lloyd, that use the Gulf of Aden, to make new plans, including stepping up security or changing their routes. One shipping company announced last month it would bypass the region altogether, sailing instead around the Cape of Good Hope and adding thousands of kilometers to its voyages. Read more about how to solve the pirate problem here. Hapag-Lloyd said a general travel warning for the area, issued by the German Foreign Ministry, played a part in the decision. But the company also said it had asked the German government for naval protection and the request was turned down. Representatives of Hapag-Lloyd and the German Defense Ministry could not immediately be reached for further comment. The passengers on board the Columbus began the first leg of their world cruise November 28 in Genoa, Italy and are due in Dubai on December 17, according to Hapag-Lloyd's Web site. Further stops include Singapore, Bali, Indonesia and Sydney, Australia. Hapag-Lloyd said that after the passengers and most of the crew disembark, the Columbus will sail through the Gulf of Aden with a skeleton staff. The passengers will stay in a five-star hotel in Dubai for three days until the Columbus arrives to take them back onboard, the company said. Both the crew and passengers approve of the safety measure, Hapag-Lloyd said. The U.S. State Department and British Foreign Office advise those traveling near the Somali coast to use extreme caution because of the recent pirate attacks. Last week, the Australian government issued a similar warning about travel to the region. The advice also urged Australian ships \"to apply a robust and layered protective security regime\" when traveling through the area. -- CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.", "96bebebf034d1e3645a7fa4497d9e4ba08ee3490": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice invited the woman set to replace her as the nation's top diplomat, Sen. Hillary Clinton, to dinner Monday night, a State Department spokesman said. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, left, and Sen. Hillary Clinton dined together Monday night. The dinner took place at Rice's home in the Watergate complex in downtown Washington, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. The meeting lasted for two hours, he said. \"They talked just very generally about policy -- the challenges, the opportunities -- talked a little bit about the job of secretary of state, talked about the 'building,' managing a big operation,\" McCormack said. The two dined after Clinton met with members of President-elect Barack Obama's State Department transition team on Monday. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that important information often is exchanged during such dinners between outgoing and incoming secretaries of state. Albright, who was former President Bill Clinton's top diplomat during his second term, said she had a similar dinner with Colin Powell, President Bush's first secretary of state, in 2001.  Watch Albright give her advice to Obama \u00bb . \"I'm sure they had a social part of it, but Secretary Rice told her what the major challenges are, how the department works -- we call it 'the building' -- and, generally, I think they are very nice times,\" Albright said. \"It's just a matter of really turning over the most important job in the world on foreign policy,\" she added. Albright said Clinton will have to get up to speed on a number of issues, including the status of negotiations the U.S. is engaged in, who will be part of her team and how she will work with other members of Obama's national security team. \"I know from talking to her that she has a great sense of excitement and desire to ... reintroduce America to the rest of the world,\" said Albright, who said she thought that Clinton would be \"a very great secretary of state.\" Earlier, Rice said she was looking forward to meeting her successor and said she believes Clinton will do \"a great job.\" \"I talked with her and we're going to sit down, and I'm really looking forward to it. I've known her a long time, and she is someone that I admire,\" Rice told CNN on Sunday. Despite being from different parties -- and Clinton's tough criticism of Bush's foreign policy while she was a Democratic presidential candidate -- Rice has been effusive in her praise of the former first lady. \"President-elect Obama has made his choice, and he's made a terrific choice. Hillary Clinton is somebody of intelligence, and she'll do a great job,\" Rice told ABC News on Sunday. \"She also has what's most important to being secretary of state, and that is that you love this country, and you represent it from a basis of faith in its values. And I know that she will do that,\" Rice added. Obama's decision to tap Clinton as his top diplomat already has brought about changes. On Tuesday, former President Clinton released the corporate sponsors of a Clinton Global Initiative meeting in Hong Kong, a practice he previously has resisted. The sponsors of last week's meeting included CLSA, Laureate, the Roberson Foundation, Citi, the Li Ka Shing Foundation, The Economist, HP, Ogilvy, Suzlon, Thomson Reuters and CNN.

A French army helicopter taking off from French frigate Nivose,  on patrol in the Gulf of Aden. EU foreign ministers approved the mission during their regular meeting in Brussels on Monday. Solana said the operation is \"very important\" because EU vessels will be operating \"in a place in the world that everybody's looking at because of the new problems related to piracy.\" \"It's very important that we have taken that decision to launch it tomorrow,\" he added. The EU naval force will take over the role of escorting United Nations World Food Program vessels carrying food and relief supplies to war-torn Somalia, an EU news release said. Its mandate, which is spelled out in several U.N. Security Council resolutions, also will include \"the protection of vulnerable vessels cruising off the Somali coast, and the deterrence, prevention and repression of acts of piracy and armed robbery off the Somali coast,\" the news release stated. The deployment follows a decision by the European Council in September that established a coordination cell that supported surveillance and protection operations by several member states off the Somali coast. Piracy has become increasingly common in that area this year, particularly in the Gulf of Aden. So far, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau. Those hijacked vessels include an enormous oil tanker, a chemical tanker, and a ship laden with Soviet-era arms, including tanks. The pirates normally hold the ships for ransom. The Somali-based pirates have extended their reach beyond Somalia's coastline. On Saturday, a Dutch-operated container ship outran pirates off the coast of Tanzania, an IMB official told CNN. A luxury cruise ship carrying more than 1,000 passengers and crew successfully outran pirates off the coast of Yemen last weekend. A multinational fleet -- including vessels from the United States, NATO member states, Russia and India -- has been patrolling the Indian Ocean waters near the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Around 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year. In a recent interview provided to CNN, a pirate leader claimed attacks on shipping would continue so long as life in Somalia remained desperate. \"The pirates are living between life and death,\" said the pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah. \"Who can stop them?

Simpson's accomplices in the 2007 robbery at a Las Vegas hotel were given suspended sentences Tuesday by Nevada District Judge Jackie Glass. District Court Judge Jackie Glass sentenced four O.J. Simpson codefendants to probation on Tuesday. The four -- Charles Cashmore, Charles Erlich, Michael McClinton and Walter Alexander -- all turned on Simpson and cooperated in the case against him. Simpson was sentenced last week to at least nine and as many as 33 years in prison in the case. Glass called him \"arrogant\" and \"ignorant.\" Before announcing the suspended sentences Tuesday, Glass said the actions of Cashmore, Erlich, McClinton and Alexander were \"stupid but also criminal\" when they accompanied the former football star to the Palace Station Hotel and Casino on September 13, 2007. But she praised them for taking responsibility for their actions and for cooperating with the state's case against Simpson. Should they violate the terms of their probation, the four could face prison time ranging from 12 months to 84 months, depending on the specific charges against them. The four apologized to the state and the victims in the case before their sentences were read in court Tuesday. Simpson, a former Heisman Trophy winner and record-setting NFL running back, had enlisted the help of Cashmore, Erlich, McClinton and Alexander, along with Clarence \"C.J.\" Stewart, in an effort to get sports memorabilia items that Simpson claimed belong to him from dealers Bruce Fromong and Al Beardsley.

Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said Pakistani security forces had rounded up a number of militant figures. The top military officer in the U.S. on Wednesday said he is \"encouraged\" by Pakistan's recent arrests of \"significant players\" in the Mumbai attacks. U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said the arrests amount to \"first steps\" toward determining who plotted the three day siege last month that killed 160 people in Mumbai, India's financial capital. \"There are more steps to follow,\" he noted. He also thanked India for showing restraint against Pakistan, which it has accused of harboring the terrorist groups behind the November massacre. Zarar Shah, a top operational commander of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, and Zakir Rehman Lakhvi, whose arrest had been reported Tuesday, were among the militant figures rounded up in recent days, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told reporters. Gilani would not confirm the detention of Masood Azhar, the leader of another militant group, Jaish-e-Muhammad. But he said his government has launched its own investigation into India's allegations that the gunmen who killed more than 160 people in Mumbai had links to Pakistan. The acknowledgment came three days after Pakistani security forces raided an LeT camp near Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, in the first sign of government action against Lashkar-e-Tayyiba since the three-day siege of India's financial capital. Both LeT and Jaish-e-Muhammad were formed to battle Indian rule in the divided Himalayan territory of Kashmir, and both were banned after a 2001 attack on the Indian parliament that brought the South Asian nuclear rivals to the brink of war. The United States has listed LeT as a terrorist group with ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. According to the U.S. government, Lakhvi, 47, has directed LeT's military operations in southeast Asia, Chechnya, Bosnia and Iraq. Pakistan's Defense Minister Choudhry Mukhtar Ahmed told CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN, that Lakhvi and Azhar had been arrested on Monday. Azhar has been in Pakistan since 1999, when he was released from an Indian prison in exchange for hostages aboard a hijacked Indian airliner. Indian authorities say the sole surviving gunman in the Mumbai attacks told investigators that he was trained at an LeT camp near Muzaffarabad, along with the nine other attackers who were killed in the three-day siege. A Pakistani security official said the terror raids on banned militant groups are ongoing and have resulted in at least 15 arrests.", "2f8c3a280fb430c7518726c07accbf1226b3fa1e": "(CNN) -- UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has branded the cholera crisis in Zimbabwe \"an international emergency\" and called on the world community to confront President Robert Mugabe, leader of the central African nation. A shortage of clean drinking water has unleashed a cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe. \"This is now an international rather than a national emergency,\" Brown said in a statement Saturday. \"International because disease crosses borders. International because the systems of government in Zimbabwe are now broken. There is no state capable or willing of protecting its people.\" Earlier this week the government of Zimbabwe, which already suffers from severe economic problems and political instability, declared a national emergency following the outbreak, which has so far killed more than 600 people. Cholera, a water-borne disease, is on the increase in nine of Zimbabwe's 10 provinces, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned. It blamed \"poor water and sanitation supply, a collapsed health system and limited government capacity to respond to the emergency.\" Many of those afflicted with the disease have fled to neighboring countries to seek medical help -- which risks spreading the outbreak still further. Brown called on the international community to tell Mugabe \"enough is enough,\" and suggested that the United Nations Security Council meet to discuss the issue. He added that the most pressing issue was to ensure that testing and rehydration equipment and packs reach the right people, as well as for aid agencies to set up a organizational structure in the state capital Harare to confront the disease. \"The people of Zimbabwe voted for a better future. It is our duty to support that aspiration,\" Brown added.   Brown's comments came one day after U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that the outbreak is the latest sign that Mugabe's rule over the country must end. \"It's well past time for Robert Mugabe to leave. I think that's now obvious,\" Rice said during a visit to Denmark. Washington has long called for Mugabe to leave office, with President George W. Bush calling Zimbabwe's runoff presidential election in June a \"sham\" and instructing Rice and other U.S. officials to develop additional sanctions against Mugabe's \"illegitimate government.\" \"The United States will always do anything and everything that it can to help innocent people who are suffering,\" Rice said. \"And we are not going to deny assistance to people in need because of their government. But if this is not evidence to the international community that it's time to stand up for what is right, I don't know what will be. And frankly, the nations of the region have to lead it.\" Rice -- who has just about a month left in office before President-elect Barack Obama's administration takes over -- also called on all African nations to speak up. Asked whether the United States and Europe should try to force out Mugabe, Rice responded, \"Well, without help in the region, it's very difficult to have the tools that will bring about a just resolution in Zimbabwe. The United States and Europe can't do everything alone. Other states are responsible too. And the southern African states should be the most responsible at this point, because they have the most at risk. And the people of Zimbabwe have suffered long enough.\" Supporters of Mugabe, who has come under heavy international criticism for several years, were accused of political intimidation following June's presidential  runoff vote. For months there have been some efforts to build a power-sharing government between Mugabe's ruling Zanu PF party and the opposition movement for Democratic Change, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, to little avail. On Thursday, Mugabe hinted he may form a Cabinet without the opposition and call for early elections. The opposition responded that it would welcome a \"genuine election,\" with international supervision. The 84-year-old Mugabe, who has led Zimbabwe since its independence in 1980 from Great Britain, also suggested he would ignore an international tribunal ruling that declared illegal his government's seizure of farms from white Zimbabweans.", "f43134e70b1cf8c22c560b2de7c64d935c507a72": "(CNN) -- Ghana international Michael Essien has followed goalkeeper Petr Cech in agreeing a new five-year contract with English Premier League side Chelsea.

Richard Yanis allegedly stole three handguns from his father and told police he planned to \"shoot students in the school and then himself\" at Pottstown High School, Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman said in a press release. Yanis, 15, was charged with attempted murder in adult court because juvenile law in Montgomery County excludes crimes committed with a deadly weapon, Ferman said. The investigation began when the teen's father reported that three handguns were stolen from a secured gun locker in his basement, Ferman said. His son allegedly took a Smith & Wesson .357 caliber revolver, a Smith & Wesson .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol and a Colt .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol, Ferman said.

Bob Dole appeared in its commercials in the '90s, before the blue pill with a funny name entered the public lexicon, impotence was hush-hush. Viagra entered the market 10 years ago, bringing once taboo subjects like erectile dysfunction out in the open. Now there's no getting away from it. In-boxes are clogged daily with spam mail promising cheap and instant manliness delivered fast and in bulk. Couples exchange amorous, come-hither looks followed by a lengthy recitation of side effects on TV ads. The pill helped more than 25 million men get their groove back and blasted the topic of erectile dysfunction into the open. \"It's like the nuclear explosion,\" said Dr. Irwin Goldstein, director of Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, California. \"It created sexual medicine. It allowed the taboo to be broken.\" Since the diamond-shaped blue pill debuted 10 years ago, it has become embedded in the public psyche, late-night television jokes and urologists' offices. \"It is one of the revolutionary steps in sexual health,\" said Dr. Ira Sharlip, spokesman for the American Urological Association. \"It ranks with the changes in cultural attitudes about sexuality that were started by [Sigmund] Freud, continued by [William] Masters and [Virginia] Johnson, the two researchers in the '60s, and the work that [Alfred] Kinsey did in the '40s. \"These were the huge steps in the development of our understanding of human sexuality and cultural attitudes of sex.\" Men seldom talked about their bedroom troubles before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Viagra as the first oral medication for erectile dysfunction in 1998. \"We lamented the fact that the men had so much shame about erectile dysfunction, how rarely anyone came for medical attention,\" said Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, an associate clinical professor of urology at Harvard Medical School. Penis injections and vacuum pumps were available, but these treatments weren't appealing. Men with medical conditions such as diabetes, prostate cancer, hyper cholesterol, endocrinological and cardiovascular problems weren't able to enjoy sex, Goldstein said. \"People who couldn't enjoy intimacy before have been given a second life....\" he said.  \"We have had a better life because of it.\" Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling a man to have an erection. The drug does not induce desire and works when the man is sexually aroused, according to Pfizer, the makers of Viagra. Urologists heard from patients who had tried the pill that Viagra made them feel as if they were 20-year-olds again. Anti-impotence drugs Levitra and Cialis have come along since. \"Along with the birth control pill in the '60s, this pill really changed people, society and medicine,\" Goldstein said.  \"It changed the patient-physician relationship. You can walk in and ask about sexual functions. It was a major taboo at some point.\" Dr. Gerald Melchiode, a Texas psychiatrist, agreed that the pill has helped men open up about their sexual health, but finds the commercials a bit much. \"I've never run across men singing about their impotency,\" he said. Since Viagra's appearance on the market, the dialogue about sexual dysfunctions has helped doctors identify other health problems in their patients, doctors say. \"You always hear someone drops dead,\"said Dr. Chris Steidle, a urologist who wrote the book \"Sex and the Heart.\" \"It's not sudden death if you couldn't get an erection. It's a symptom of a heart condition. You wouldn't ignore a stroke, but you would ignore erectile dysfunction -- it's a significant symptom.\" The man's penis is like \"the tip of the iceberg\" or \"the canary in the mines,\" which serve as an indicator of overall health, Morgentaler said. \"There's now good evidence that shows that men with ED who have no other symptoms of anything are at increased risk for heart attacks and strokes,\" he said. Thousands of studies have been conducted on Viagra. \"The pill that thrills\" is also being studied to see whether it gives athletes an edge in competition. It's been studied to see whether it helps women with their sexual health. Despite the deluge of attention, Viagra doesn't work for about 25 percent to 35 percent of men with erectile dysfunction. For others, it has revitalized and strained marriages. Experts say Viagra gave a window into the psyche of men and women. Some complain that sex should be spontaneous and that popping a pill ruins the romance. Eating food decreases the potency of Viagra, and some say the pill forces them to go on a schedule. Another complaint: Having to use Viagra makes a spouse or partner feel undesirable. \"Sometimes their spouse personalizes it,\" said Melchiode. \"Why does he have to take this pill? Aren't I attractive enough? Aren't I sexy enough for him? That's not unusual for the partner.\" Even when Viagra is effective, some men realize that it's not the magic bullet that solves their problems with intimacy, doctors said.  Only about half refill their prescription. \"One has to think beyond just giving a pill to cure sexual problems,\" Melchiode said. \"A typical example is a couple where there's been problems over the years and they can't deal with the problems on a verbal level, so they start withdrawing from one another. They build up a resentment and anger, they have trouble being close to one another and having sex with each other. Just giving them a pill isn't going to touch on all the problems of the resentment and anger.\" Sex, it turns out, is part of a bigger web of relationship issues. Morgentaler, author of \"The Viagra Myth,\" said: \"It's unrealistic that there's a pill that fixes all of these things.\"", "ffd9898acbe737ca2b8864c332f89e27aeb85e60": "SODDY-DAISY, Tennessee (CNN) -- Kat Koonce loves her Saturns. She owns three, and has pictures of them on Saturnfans.com, where she is one of almost 2,500 Saturn devotees who've posted photo albums of their vehicles. Saturn owners show off their Sky roadsters after a Christmas parade in Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, on Sunday. Judy Pearson shows off a photo album of her Saturn Sky roadster the way a grandmother might show off one of her grandchildren -- pictures of vacations and happy times together. The women are exactly the kind of customers General Motors was looking for when it introduced the Saturn brand two decades ago as \"a different kind of car company.\" The brand's slogan is now one word -- \"rethink\" -- but its fate may soon be summed up in another -- \"done.\" General Motors has raised the prospect of eliminating the nameplate as it tries to restructure to regain profitability. \"I just can't stand the thought of them doing away with Saturn,\" said Dianne Pollard of Hixson, Tennessee. She created the Sky Club of Chattanooga, dedicated to the sporty two-seater. General Motors hasn't officially announced the end of Saturn, but in a restructuring plan submitted to Congress, the automaker said it would concentrate resources on four core brands -- Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC. That leaves Saturn, along with GM's Pontiac, Saab and Hummer brands, with a dim future.  See how Saturn owners are devoted to their vehicles \u00bb . Pollard drove her black 2008 RedLine (that's Saturn's name for a turbo) Sky in Sunday's Christmas parade in Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, northeast of Chattanooga. Fellow Hixson residents and Sky devotees Connie Terrell (red 2007 RedLine) and Pearson (dark blue 2007 standard edition) were there, too. All three have owned other, more sedate Saturns than the Sky, which Edmunds.com praises for \"sharp styling, low price and everyday comfort\" and Car and Driver.com calls a \"mini-Corvette\" at around half the price. They were joined by George and Brenda Holloway, who drove their 2007 Sky almost 100 miles from their farm in Centre, Alabama, to join in the parade. \"We thoroughly enjoy the Saturn. Our next vehicle, when we buy one, will be a Saturn,\" Brenda Holloway said. \"This is the only car I've ever owned that you can be driving down the interstate and people pull up beside you and take a picture of it,\" her husband, a retired 20-year Army veteran, said with amusement-tinged pride. But it's not just the cars -- including the original S series sedans and coupes -- that turn people into \"Saturnistas\"; it's also the pleasant buying experience and over-the-top customer service. \"It's a family. It's the Saturn family. And you become part of that family,\" Pearson said. All three Sky owners from Hixson had stories to tell about a sales consultant who went the extra mile or a service call that exceeded their expectations. Pearson said she has owned many makes of cars, including foreign nameplates, and Saturn's treatment of customers beats them all. \"The best experience I've ever had was with Saturn, bar none,\" she said. Koonce, of Dayton, Ohio, used to feel that way, too. But Koonce now says GM might as well kill off the brand, because that would be preferable to the slow death she sees as inevitable. Saturn sold slightly more than 8,000 cars in November and has delivered about 175,000 this year. That's a far cry from the half a million GM had hoped to sell each year when it introduced Saturn. Koonce said she fell in love with Saturn before she was old enough to drive. She became such a familiar figure at her local Saturn dealer and so knowledgeable about its lineup that she was hired as a sales consultant. She and her husband, Nick, met at a Saturn owners' event, their wedding was a Saturn owners' event, and they have owned six Saturns between them. They have brought numerous relatives and friends \"into the Saturn cult,\" said Nick, whose dream is to own a Saturn dealership. Saturn was conceived in the early 1980s as a separate-standing division of GM, with then-unheard-of features: . \u2022 an innovative new plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee; . \u2022 a separate agreement with the United Auto Workers that embraced more teamwork between union and management; . \u2022 the use of plastics instead of metal for many body parts; . \u2022 and a highly personalized consumer experience, including no-haggle buying and \"Homecomings,\" a sort of family reunion for Saturn owners at the Spring Hill campus. The first Saturn came off the Spring Hill assembly line on July 30, 1990. Unfortunately, Kat Koonce said, GM has abandoned what made Saturn different. The cars are now made of metal, and the models all have twins in other GM divisions. Even the original Spring Hill factory has been converted to build Chevrolets instead of Saturns; the Saturn VUE is built in Mexico. So disillusioned was Koonce that she quit her job at the Saturn dealership and went back to college. \"It was a success that became a failure,\" she said. Walter S. McManus, the head of the Automotive Analysis Division of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, says he could see it coming. \"Brand loyalty is overrated,\" McManus stated flatly. \"It is costly to do all the fuzzies, and Saturn's example is clear that it doesn't pay off for what is essentially an economy-car company. Women especially appreciated the Saturn way, but Honda sells more cars to women, despite having a less female-friendly approach.\" Don't tell that to Charlie Eickmeyer, who runs the Saturnfans Web site and has posted a \"Save Saturn\" petition for the site's 35,000 members to sign. And don't tell the Sky Club of Chattanooga. \"I think Saturn really is a different kind of car company, and that is what has brought me back to them,\" Pearson said.", "57134ae4deea60bd791ff29e6678a8f9b4edc52c": "(CNN) -- It's hard to imagine Meryl Streep having second thoughts about tackling any role, but the actress admits that she had doubts about \"Doubt,\" her newest project. The cast of \"Doubt,\" from left: Viola Davis, Amy Adams, Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film -- based on a Tony Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning play by the same name -- examines what happens when a strict nun who heads a Catholic school in the Bronx suspects a charismatic priest of having an inappropriate relationship with a student. \"I actually didn't think it would ever be a movie,\" Streep said. \"It was so thoroughly realized on stage, and it was so minimal. It was hard to imagine how or why you would make a movie out of it.\" But Streep, who plays the terrifyingly severe and determined school principal, Sister Aloysius Beauvier, said she changed her mind when she saw the final product. \"How did they make the play without any children in it? It is just sort of amazing to me, because to me they are sort of the landscape. They are the lambs of the movie. They are the stakes. They are why everybody is passionate.\" Her co-stars are passionate about sharing the screen with a Hollywood legend. Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays the priest targeted by Streep's character in the film, says he \"adores\" her. Amy Adams calls Streep \"a sweetheart.\" Viola Davis says she's \"just fantastic.\" Davis' performance in the movie is generating Oscar buzz, with Streep advising the actress to pick out a dress for the Academy Awards. Davis, who plays the mother of the student at the center of the sexual abuse allegations at the school, said she drew on the experiences of her mom and other women she knows to bring the role to life. She expressed awe about any suggestion of an Oscar nomination. \"It's surreal. I don't know how to respond to that anymore,\" Davis said. \"All I wanted to do was good work. ... Everything else is just the icing on the cake.\" The movie is set in 1964, but the play was written by John Patrick Shanley after the sexual abuse scandal that rocked the Roman Catholic Church several years ago. Hoffman -- who plays Father Flynn, the priest under fire -- said the lurid headlines about molested children weren't even on his mind when he took on the project. \"It is really about something else. If people see it, they will know what I mean about that,\" Hoffman said. Some have suggested that the play served as a criticism of the Bush administration's dogged belief that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Shanley, who won an Academy Award for his screenplay of \"Moonstruck,\" told Entertainment Weekly that the play did have a political point. \"I'm not interested in morality,\" he told the magazine. \"One of my larger premises in doing this play, in what's not said, is that doubt itself is a passionate exercise. I think it's perceived in this culture as something weak or denatured, and that's a huge mistake.\" Adams said she became \"a little obsessed\" with the adaptation of the play to the big screen. She plays Sister James, a nun who expresses her suspicions about Father Flynn's relationship with the student to Sister Aloysius. The movie is a departure for Adams, who became famous for sunnier roles in films like \"Enchanted\" and \"Talladega Nights.\" But she said she doesn't mind being known as an eternally cheerful actress, because that description reflects \"75 percent\" of her real persona. \"There's 25 percent that's probably dark and grumpy and not personable at all, but I keep her at home,\" Adams said. As for Oscar buzz surrounding her performance, the actress said she's keeping her fingers crossed for Streep and Davis to be nominated for their roles in \"Doubt\" but has no expectations for herself. \"It's always fun ,and I would love to. If it doesn't happen for me, it's all right as well,\" Adams said. \"So, the experience of making the film was my get in this case.\"", "cc046329de1ebd5950caf5b5bd51a878c1dcab55": "(CNN) -- One of Zimbabwe's top officials blamed his country's spreading cholera outbreak on what he calls \"a genocidal onslaught\" by Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler -- Britain. Zimbabwean clinics have been overwhelmed by the cholera epidemic, according to aid organizations. \"Cholera is a calculated, racist attack on Zimbabwe by the unrepentant former colonial power, which has enlisted support from its American and Western allies so that they can invade the country,\" Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu told reporters. Britain ruled the country as a colony until 1965. Ndlovu's claims triggered quick and pointed reaction from Britain and the United States. In Washington, State Department spokesman Rob McInturff called Ndlovu's accusations \"patently ridiculous.\" Referring to Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, McInturff said Friday that, \"Mugabe is clearly unwilling to take any meaningful action (to stop the cholera outbreak).\" On Thursday, Mugabe said \"there is no cholera in the country.\" His spokesman later said that Mugabe was sarcastically ridiculing what he believes are Western designs to invade the country. Britain's Africa minister, Mark Malloch-Brown responded by saying, \"I don't know what world he (Mugabe) is living in,\" according to the British newspaper The Guardian. Malloch-Brown made the comment during a one-day trip to South Africa, where he visited a Johannesburg church housing 1,600 Zimbabweans who have fled their country, the newspaper said. \"There is a raging humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe as well as an economic crisis and still there is no representative government able to lead the country out of this disaster,\" he said, according to The Guardian. Cholera has ravaged Zimbabwe, causing nearly 800 deaths and infecting more than 16,000 people, the World Health Organization says. The outbreak could surpass 60 000 cases, according to an estimate by the Zimbabwe Health Cluster, which is a group coordinated by the World Health Organization.  View image gallery of Zimbabwe's cholera crisis \u00bb . Cholera, a bacterial waterborne disease that causes diarrhea, dehydration and, if not treated, death in a matter of hours, is widespread in Zimbabwe but help is not. Like the general Zimbabwean economy, the country's health delivery system is strapped, lacking modern drugs and machinery, while doctors and nurses have been striking for over a month. On Friday, the State Department issued a travel warning for U.S. citizens because of the cholera outbreak and violence that has flared as Zimbabwe's economy has deteriorated. \"The public health system in Zimbabwe no longer provides even basic services due to a lack of staff, electricity, clean water, and medical supplies,\" the travel warning said. \"Americans who fall ill while in Zimbabwe may find it difficult to find treatment.\" At the State Department's daily press briefing Friday, spokesman Sean McCormack said the situation in Zimbabwe will be one of the topics Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will discuss when she visits the United Nations next week. \"The number of cases of cholera -- statements from Robert Mugabe notwithstanding -- is going up, not down,\" McCormack said. \"The crisis has not ended. People's lives are in danger.\" Health experts say the Zimbabwean government can win the battle against cholera only if it imports adequate stocks of water-treating chemicals and disposes of refuse and sewerage properly.  Watch shocking footage of Zimbabwe's humanitarian crisis (Discretion advised) \u00bb . A Doctors Without Borders epidemiologist in Zimbabwe said, referring to the capital city, that \"the scale and sheer numbers of infection, especially in Harare, is unprecedented.\" He said the group has treated more than 11,000 patients since August and has 500 international and local staff members treating people in cholera centers across the country. He said the main reasons for the outbreak are poor access to clean water, uncollected garbage in the streets and burst and blocked sewage systems. \"The fact that the outbreak has become so large is an indication that the country's health system can't cope,\" he said. Meanwhile, in his statement Thursday Mugabe said, \"I am happy to say our doctors, assisted by others and the World Health Organization, have now arrested cholera. So now that there is no cholera, there is no cause for war anymore. Let's tell them (Britain and the United States) that the cholera cause does not exist anymore, if it was cause for war.\" The pro-government Herald, quoting presidential spokesman George Charamba, said Mugabe had been sarcastically reacting to \"calls for intrusive action\" against Zimbabwe from European leaders. Charamba said the country continues to want international assistance to combat the disease and has declared a state of emergency. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change, which rivals Mugabe's ZANU-PF party, issued statements deploring the Mugabe government's \"indifferent and casual approach\" to cholera and saying it was \"alarmed by Mugabe's irresponsible and false remarks\" on Thursday. \"The ZANU-PF caretaker government is in a denial mode. The MDC believes that it is such careless and reckless statements that have not helped the situation,\" MDC said. \"We should be honest with ourselves and with the world. The truth is that cholera remains a major disaster in Zimbabwe,\" the MDC said. In his remarks to reporters in Zimbabwe, Ndlovu -- who said the country's health system is working on the outbreak -- labeled the cholera outbreak \"a serious biological, chemical war force, a genocidal onslaught, on the people of Zimbabwe by the British,\" He also made reference to U.S. President George W. Bush and Rice: \"To the outgoing warmongers, please leave in peace and not in pieces.\" Ndlovu also slammed news outlets including CNN for what he called \"gunboat journalism.\" \"They take photos (of) people dying (in) the DRC and Darfur and say these are cholera victims from Zimbabwe,\" he said, making reference to the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Darfur region of Sudan.", "b3d47460eac09e09a829cb936a232bd79a320a7d": "(CNN) -- A day before Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was busted by federal investigators on corruption charges, he dared authorities to tape his phone calls if they thought he was guilty of anything. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, shown here in 2003, was known as a tireless campaigner. \"If anybody wants to tape my conversations, go right ahead, feel free to do it,\" Blagojevich said Monday outside a Chicago window factory where workers were protesting their layoffs. His comment came in response to a reporter's question about corruption allegations. Authorities had indeed bugged the governor's campaign office and tapped his home phone, catching him talking about alleged plans to sell the U.S. Senate seat left empty by President-elect Barack Obama. During his political career, Blagojevich made headlines. A native Chicagoan, he was thought of as a charismatic guy who always liked to ingratiate himself to the working man. But he was never considered a natural politician, particularly when he first began exploring a run for the governorship in 2002. His father, Rade Blagojevich, was a Yugoslavian immigrant who came to America after World War II. The elder Blagojevich worked in a steel mill to support his family, which was then living on the city's then-downtrodden northwest side. As a boy, Blagojevich held odd jobs -- shining shoes, delivering pizzas -- and worked in Alaska for two summers in his teens. He used the money to enroll in Northwestern University, a prestigious school in Evanston, Illinois, just outside of Chicago. He went on to law school at Pepperdine University, then went back to Chicago after graduation to be a lawyer. Blagojevich later joined the State's Attorney Office in Cook County -- the county in which Chicago is located -- and built a reputation for prosecuting domestic violence cases. During his time as a lawyer, where Blagojevich grew to enjoy the increasing public spotlight, he began flirting with the idea of running for office. He met his wife, Patricia Mell, in 1988 at a political fundraiser for her father, well-known Chicago Alderman Richard Mell. Blagojevich started working in the father's office, married Patricia Mell and had a daughter, Amy. They had another daughter a few years later. He served in the Illinois House from 1992 to 1996, representing the North Side Chicago district before moving on to Congress in 1997. During his three terms in Congress, he helped bring $240 million in federal funds to the Chicago Transit Authority and an additional $10 million to help protect Lake Michigan's shoreline. He grabbed headlines in 1999 when he traveled to Yugoslavia with the Rev. Jesse Jackson to negotiate the release of three American soldiers. Blagojevich met with then-President Slobodan Milosevic, who later faced a war crimes tribunal but died of a heart attack before the proceedings were concluded. Blagojevich set his sights on the governorship in 2002 with an aggressive appeal to the workaday Illinoisan. He portrayed himself as a regular guy who wanted to do right by the middle class. Tirelessly campaigning, knocking on doors and running down-home-flavored television ads, Blagojevich jokingly told voters not to worry about pronouncing his last name right. Just call me Rod, he said. At one point, a staunch supporter of his Republican opponent, Michael P. Flanagan, marveled to the Chicago Sun-Times that he was impressed by the number of appearances Blagojevich was making during the campaign. \"He is one of the most energetic guys in politics today,\" Flanagan said in a Sun-Times profile. \"If he was an athlete, they would test him for amphetamines. He would come up clean -- but they would test him.\" Blagojevich was able to leverage a string of endorsements from popular figures like Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. He also got the support of the Service Employees International Union, the Illinois Federation of Teachers, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. In the 2002 governor's race, Blagojevich rode to victory 7 points ahead of opponent Jim Ryan. Blagojevich commenced his re-election campaign in 2006 by promising not to raise state income or sales taxes during his second term. In May 2008, Blagojevich proposed a $150 million initiative to combat youth violence. In July, he pardoned 19 convicted criminals, including several who had been exonerated, and in August called a special legislative session to consider reducing state construction costs in order to increase money for schools. Earlier this week, Blagojevich was in the news again -- standing beside and supporting the workers suddenly laid off at the Chicago window factory. The employees complained that the layoffs came without the 60 days' notice required by federal law. Speaking to reporters as he stood with the workers, Blagojevich spoke of the need to follow the law. \"We are going to do everything possible here in Illinois to side with these workers,\" he said. \"And it isn't just lending them moral support, but it's ... making sure that we have our court system enforce the federal laws so these workers are getting what they're entitled to under the law and under what is the right thing to do.\"", "6c4e7f28374e4bdbae7aa99688a5c0a8c68c1a2b": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Sen.

CNN has previously reported that the 61-year-old former Senate majority leader from South Dakota would be Obama's choice, but not the announcement date. In November, Daschle said he was excited about the possibility of serving as point person in Obama's effort to change the nation's health care system. Daschle is on the health care advisory group of Obama's transition team and said he plans to write the health care plan that Obama submits to Congress next year. \"I hope to have the plan enacted by next year, and then it will take several years to implement,\" Daschle said last month. Daschle said reforming health care in the United States must be a priority in the current economic climate. \"We can't afford not to do it,\" he said. \"If we do nothing, we'll be paying twice as much on health care in 10 years as we do today.\" Daschle served as Democratic leader in the Senate from 1995 until he lost a re-election bid in 2004. Representing South Dakota, he was first elected as a congressman in 1978 and served in the House until he was elected to the Senate in 1986. He recently wrote a book on health care titled \"Critical: What We Can Do About the Health Care Crisis.\" In the book, he pushed for universal health care coverage to reach 46 million uninsured Americans by expanding the federal employee health benefits program to include private employer plans together with Medicaid and Medicare. Most Republicans oppose any such plan, saying it would give too much power to the government. They've also questioned Daschle's recent work for a Washington lobbying firm. His wife, Linda Daschle, is a registered lobbyist for a firm that includes health care clients. But a source close to Daschle told CNN that Linda Daschle would be leaving the firm at the end of the year to set up her own company focusing on transportation lobbying in order to clear any potential conflicts of interest.

Investigators have sealed off the Anthony home, which shows a large Caylee poster. The sheriff's office in Orange County, Florida, said it is seeking a warrant to search the home of George and Cindy Anthony. Sheriff Kevin Beary said the home has been secured \"pending more investigation.\" The house has the \"possibility of being more of a crime scene later,\" he added. A child's skull was found at about 9:30 a.m. by a utility meter reader who alerted authorities, sheriff's spokesman Jim Solomons said. Investigators, including those from the Anthony case, rushed to the scene, he added.  Watch investigators swarm the scene \u00bb . CNN affiliate WFTV reported that the meter reader picked up a plastic bag at the site and a skull fell out. The remains have been removed by the medical examiner and will be sent to the FBI lab at Quantico, Virginia, Sheriff Beary said. The agency has told its lab analysts that the case is top priority, Beary added. \"If they have to work through the weekend, they'll work through the weekend.\" \"Bottom line, it's real simple, folks,\" Beary said. \"We've recovered this human skull, it appears to be that of a small child, and now the investigation continues. We've got a lot of lab work to do, a lot of DNA work to do, a lot of crime scene work to do. We could be here all night.\"  Watch the sheriff talk about what needs to be done \u00bb . Prosecutors have asked police not to disclose many details surrounding the discovery, Beary said. Caylee Anthony, 3, has been missing since June in a case that has received national attention. Casey Anthony, the child's 22-year-old mother, was charged last month with murder and other offenses. She is being held at the Orange County Jail. The area where the remains were found had been searched as part of the investigation into Caylee's disappearance, he said. But the precise spot where a county meter reader found them -- \"45, 50, 60 feet back\" from the street -- was flooded at the time of the search. No clothes were found with the remains, Beary said. Asked whether the remains could belong to another child, Beary said, \"Not that we know of, but that's always a possibility, and that's why we've got a lot of work to do on this case still.\" Earlier, authorities said the Anthony family had been notified of the discovery. The remains were found \"in very close proximity\" to the Anthony home, Solomons said.  View a map of where the remains were found \u00bb . An attorney for Casey Anthony filed legal papers Thursday afternoon seeking a court order to preserve all evidence collected, and to permit the defense to conduct its own forensic testing. A hearing has been scheduled for Friday morning. In a court hearing earlier Thursday, 9th Circuit Judge Stan Strickland postponed Casey Anthony's trial at the request of defense attorney Jose Baez. The attorney said he had not received all the evidence due him from prosecutors and was not ready to proceed with the January 5 trial. Baez asked Strickland whether the trial could be delayed until March. The judge scheduled a hearing January 15 to consider a new trial date as well as a possible change of venue. Casey Anthony remains in protective custody and has no contact with other inmates, corrections officials said. \"She has been seen by a Corrections Health Services psychologist and her status was reviewed,\" officials said in a statement, adding Anthony was under psychological observation -- which is not the same as suicide watch. Baez arrived at the jail just before noon Thursday and stayed about an hour and a half, officials said. Prosecutors said this month that they would not seek the death penalty against Casey Anthony. If convicted of murder, she could be sentenced to life in prison. Authorities have said Casey Anthony waited about a month before telling her family that Caylee was gone. Cindy Anthony -- Caylee's grandmother and Casey Anthony's mother -- called the Orange County sheriff's office July 15, saying her daughter would not tell her where Caylee was. When questioned, Casey Anthony gave conflicting statements to police, including some that were later disproved, according to hundreds of documents and investigative reports released in the case. She claimed that she dropped Caylee off with a baby-sitter, but when police checked out her story, they learned that the address Casey Anthony supplied belonged to an apartment that had been vacant for weeks. The woman Casey Anthony named as her baby-sitter told police she did not know her. Investigators have said that cadaver dogs picked up the scent of death in Anthony's car, as well as in her parents' backyard. They also said air quality tests conducted by the FBI found evidence consistent with human decomposition and chloroform in the car's trunk. A neighbor told police Anthony had asked to borrow a shovel. Also, an analysis of Anthony's computer found that she had visited Web sites discussing chloroform and had done Internet searches on missing children, according to information released in the case. \"There isn't a motive, and they haven't found a motive,\" Cindy Anthony said Wednesday night on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\"  Watch Cindy Anthony insist her daughter is innocent \u00bb . She added, \"They told us they thought it was an accident, and she's scared and tried to cover it up. They don't feel there's a motive.\" Cindy Anthony stressed that five searches for the girl's body have \"come up with nothing. There's nothing that they have found that, you know, has given them any evidence that Caylee is no longer with us.\" The Anthonys said they believe that the girl is still alive and that someone has her, noting several reports of sightings. Last month, Strickland denied prosecutors' request to impose a gag order in Anthony's case, saying he could not state that continued publicity would pose a threat to her trial or even that a gag order would stem the flood of media attention.

Relatives describe Cynthia Lynch as having a deep need to feel wanted and eager to join groups. Her relatives told investigators that Cynthia Lynch, 43, of Tulsa, Oklahoma, had never been outside her home state, said Capt. George Bonnett of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Department. But she recently took a bus to Slidell, Louisiana, where she was met by two Klan members and taken to a campsite in the woods near Sun, Louisiana, about 60 miles north of New Orleans. Bonnett and Sheriff Jack Strain gave CNN this account of what happened: . During the initiation rite, members of the Klan group, which calls itself the Sons of Dixie, shaved Lynch's head. After 24 hours of drills, including chanting and running with torches, she asked to be taken to town. An argument began and the group's leader, Chuck Foster, allegedly pushed her to the ground and shot her to death without warning. Lynch wanted to leave the campsite because she was homesick, investigators concluded after talking to Lynch's family in Tulsa.  Watch how an initiation rite went wrong \u00bb . Strain told CNN that Foster used a knife to remove the bullet. Other members of the Sons of Dixie helped cover up the slaying for Foster, their leader or \"Grand Lordship,\" Strain added. The attempt to conceal the killing included burning the woman's personal items, Strain said. The new details emerged Thursday as the FBI announced it was assisting local authorities.

Welker. He added that the FBI would \"aggressively investigate\" any leads and urged anyone with information to call the FBI at  504-816-3000 . Sheriff's investigators said they received the intitial tip about the killing from a convenience store clerk. Two of the group members went into the store and asked the clerk if he knew how to get bloodstains out of their clothes, Strain said. The clerk told them no, and called the sheriff after they left. Officials tracked down those two members and arrested them. Authorities established telephone contact with other members of the group who were still at the campsite and let them know law enforcement officials were on their way. They surrendered without incident. Foster was elsewhere in the woods, but he also surrendered, the sheriff said.  Watch report on Klan initiation gone awry \u00bb . The woman's body was found under loose brush along a road several miles from the campsite. At the campsite, investigators found Confederate flags, KKK banners, five Klan robes and an Imperial Wizard robe. Foster, 44, is charged with second-degree murder. He remained Thursday at the St. Tammany Parish jail with no bail set, authorities said. Seven other suspects also remained in jail Thursday, charged with obstruction of justice. Bail for each was set at $500,000. On Wednesday, sheriff's investigators searched a house Foster had rented for the past five years in Bogalusa. They found Klan paraphernalia, documents and computer files. Among the seized documents were membership applications, titles and a chain of command for group members . \"We recovered various documents out of that home that are giving us an indication of the organizational structure and the organizational guidelines of the group,\" Bonnett said. Fred Oswold, chief of criminal investigations for the sheriff's office, said the Sons of Dixie Klan group is small and that most of its members already had been arrested. \"So far we have learned that they were a small group, but they were fairly organized,\" said Oswold, who said his agency is working with the FBI to learn more about the group.

Suleman Ali sold Esgut, his portfolio of Facebook applications, for seven figures in April. The 26-year-old, a former Microsoft employee who helped put together the Windows Home Server product, founded a company called Esgut within months of the debut of Facebook's developer platform in May 2007. Esgut is a portfolio of Facebook applications, and a few of them, like Superlatives and Entourage, became genuine viral hits. In April, Ali sold the 12-employee Esgut to the Social Gaming Network, a Silicon Valley company backed by the likes of Bezos Expeditions, the Founders Fund, and Greylock Partners. He said the price was in the seven figures. But Ali is the first to acknowledge that for upstart social-platform developers, hailed just months ago as the Valley's hottest breed of bright young things, the condition has taken a significant turn for the worse. \"Most people are not counting on anything,\" the lanky and bespectacled Ali said over lunch at an organic restaurant near New York's Union Square in early December. \"They're just operating from day to day.\" When Facebook's developer platform launched, the social network's traffic began to really skyrocket. What had started as a no-frills networking site for students at elite universities became a Silicon Valley buzz factory with legitimate geek credentials. And however gimmicky many of the most popular Facebook Platform apps were, millions of people decided they now had a reason to join the site. The floodgates had opened. Facebook was a phenomenon. When other social networks such as MySpace, Friendster, and Hi5 also paraded out developer platforms, the tech world took it as evidence that there was a big future in building platform applications. More importantly for developers and ambitious tech entrepreneurs, it looked like there could be gobs of money in it; the open, anyone-can-play attitude created the notion that there was enough for everyone. \"The social platform (on Facebook) actually launched the last day that I was at Microsoft...I was quitting without any idea of what I was going to do,\" Ali recalled. His aims for leaving Redmond were starry-eyed. \"I left because I wanted to do a start-up. I wanted to see what I could do out there on my own. And I wanted to care deeply about what I was working on.\" But he had no concrete plans to go the Facebook route initially, he said. \"I ended up in my parents' house in Florida and was kind of bored, and started building Facebook apps just out of restlessness and the desire to do something.\" Then, Ali continued, he went to the Graphing Social Patterns West conference in San Diego in March and met Social Gaming Network founder Shervin Pishevar. At the time, he was looking to raise venture funding but hadn't thought about selling his apps. \"We talked for 30 minutes and he was like, 'You sound like the exact type of people we want at SGN.'\" Ali sold Esgut to Pishevar's company the next month. Widgets buzz turns into hush . Ali got lucky. Even before the reality of the recession set in, the social-platform craze was subsiding. The venture capital buzz about widgets began to quiet over the summer. Some of the sillier novelty apps wore off in popularity. Companies that were snapping up small apps and raising huge amounts of venture capital, like Slide and RockYou, grew intimidatingly bigger--but the glut of independent apps made it more difficult to grab the attention of potential buyers. And after new restrictions, a redesign, and then the social network's focus on expanding through its Facebook Connect log-in service, it became evident that a social-network platform is still a new phenomenon that can change dramatically, and not always to the benefit of little start-ups. \"There's definitely a lot of tightening up,\" Ali said. \"There's a few people that I know that have apps that are relatively small, and they're selling them for valuations lower than what they could've sold them for a month ago, and there are just no buyers in the marketplace. I think they're going to have a hard time selling, period--forget trying to sell at a lower valuation. They're just having a hard time getting rid of them.\" So would he still be able to sell his company as easily now? \"No, probably not,\" Ali admitted. \"If we were the same company we were then, it would be much harder to sell today. I think we would've had to evolve as a company. I think we would need to be generating more revenue than we were.\" But for all his concern about the fate of social-platform developers in a recession, Ali is still strikingly bullish on Facebook--enough so that his newest project is a fund for Facebook stock. He started purchasing it in November, he said, and is meeting with investors in the hopes of purchasing more. He added with surprising gusto that Facebook's decision to delay direct cash-outs hasn't derailed his plan. \"I think that's actually good news for us,\" Ali said. \"I think that means that the price that we pay will actually go down because there are all these employees who intended to sell stock back to Facebook, and now they're not going to be able to sell it to Facebook, (so) they'll have to sell it somewhere else.\" He hopes to keep the stock until Facebook files for an initial public offering, and he still thinks that's on track, too. \"I think it's going to be a function of the economy and when the markets open back up for an IPO,\" he said, and cited target dates that had been provided in interviews by Facebook investor and board member Jim Breyer. \"From a Facebook perspective, I think it'll be ready to IPO in 2011.\" Many critics would say that's wishful thinking, and that the company will sell--to existing investor Microsoft, maybe--for much lower than its $15 billion preferred-stock valuation. But Ali got lucky on Facebook once already, and even in a recession he hasn't given up hope that it could happen again. \u00a9 2008 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

Illinois first lady Patricia Blagojevich was born into a political family. \"Hold up that f---ing Cubs s---. F--- them,\" she allegedly said as her husband, Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, bandied about a scheme to withhold state funds from the Cubs' parent Tribune Company unless the owner agreed to fire certain Chicago Tribune employees. Seven days later, according to the affidavit, she took part in a meeting about whether President-elect Barack Obama would secure a lucrative job for her if her husband appointed Obama's preferred candidate to his vacant Senate seat. U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald has said Patricia Blagojevich is not the target of the investigation of the governor's alleged attempts to sell Obama's Senate seat, pressure the Chicago Tribune and threaten to withdraw funding from a children's hospital.  Watch what prosecutors say was the first lady's role in alleged scandal \u00bb . A glance at her profile on the governor's Web site details a list of philanthropic endeavors, including awareness campaigns for breast cancer, heart disease and food allergies. She also has championed children's health care and literacy, and has parlayed her love for gardening into the State Beautification Initiative. \"As first lady, she works hard to promote initiatives that will help the families of Illinois bring up happy, healthy and successful children,\" her biography says. Blagojevich and her family have been part of the Chicago machine for decades. The 43-year-old mother of two is the oldest daughter of Margaret Mell and longtime Chicago Alderman Richard Mell, whose district includes part of Chicago's Northwest Side, where Rod Blagojevich was raised. Patricia Blagojevich has two siblings, Rich Mell Jr. and Deborah Mell, a gay rights activist and incoming state representative who was arrested in March 2004 while protesting Cook County, Illinois,' refusal to grant her a same-sex marriage license. Deborah Mell had said she would run for the seat of U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel after Obama tapped him as his chief of staff, but she later withdrew from consideration. Richard Mell is a well-known Chicago power player who has served on the City Council since 1975. Rod Blagojevich met his future wife in 1988, at one of the alderman's fundraisers. The couple married in 1990, and Mell put his political weight behind Rod Blagojevich, who quickly ascended the political ranks. Mell has long been credited as choreographer of that rise, which took Rod Blagojevich from the Cook County state's attorney office to the Illinois General Assembly (1992) to the U.S. House of Representatives (1997) to the governor's office (2003). Rod and Patricia Blagojevich did not move into the governor's mansion in Springfield, opting instead to live 200 miles north in Chicago's upscale Ravenswood Manor neighborhood. There, they live with their daughters -- Amy, 10, and Annie, 4. After Rod Blagojevich was elected to the state's top post, a public feud erupted between the governor and Mell. Tensions reached a flash point in January 2005, when Rod Blagojevich reportedly shut down a Joliet, Illinois, landfill owned by Patricia Blagojevich's second cousin. Mell, in an interview with the Chicago-Sun Times, castigated Rod Blagojevich as someone who \"uses everybody, and when there's no more use, he discards them.\" Mell further said that his daughter was wearing \"blinders\" and didn't realize her husband was a manipulative political animal who would \"throw anyone under the bus.\" Mell also leveled a flurry of allegations against his son-in-law's administration -- most notably that Rod Blagojevich's fundraising chief, Christopher Kelly, \"trades appointments to commissions for checks for $50,000\" to the governor's political fund, the newspaper reported. Asked Wednesday if he would discuss his 2005 allegations, Mell responded via e-mail, \"My main concern right now is for my daughter and grandchildren. I would rather not discuss this sad situation in the public venue at this time.\" Reports vary on whether the family feud was ever laid to rest. Though fences were mended two years ago, after Mell's wife died of a terminal brain disease, the Sun-Times reported the bad feelings later resurfaced. Though Mell did not accuse his daughter of improprieties in his well-publicized rant, Patricia Blagojevich has been the subject of scrutiny over her real estate deals, most notably those involving businessman Antoin Rezko. Rezko, who was convicted in the summer on 16 counts, including fraud, money laundering and abetting bribery, is part of this week's allegations against Rod Blagojevich. Federal authorities allege Rezko is one of the conspirators with whom the governor schemed in what Fitzgerald called \"a corruption crime spree.\" The first lady, a licensed real estate broker and appraiser with an economics degree from the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, has not been charged with wrongdoing. Patricia Blagojevich's ties to Rezko came under fire after the Chicago Tribune in 2005 reported that 25 percent of her income in 2004 -- about $38,000 -- came via deals with Rezko, one of the governor's top fundraisers at the time. Aides to the governor said there was nothing nefarious about the business relationship. In October, the Chicago Tribune reported that the first lady's home-based real estate firm, River Realty, had received about $700,000 in commissions since 2000, when Blagojevich began raising funds for his gubernatorial run. Of those commissions, the paper reported, about three-quarters came from \"state contractors, family and others with political ties.\" Among her associates, the Tribune reported, were William Cellini, a key player in the Rezko trial, and Anita Mahajan, who was charged in 2007 with bilking Illinois out of more than $2 million for drug-screening services her firm never performed. The paper reported that Mahajan's husband, Amrish, was a former Blagojevich fundraiser. Despite the reported income, the federal affidavit outlining the charges against Rod Blagojevich states the governor was bemoaning his family's \"financial stress\" and expressing hope that Obama might help alleviate it. A six-figure salary for serving on a corporate or nonprofit board would help the \"struggling\" family, he allegedly said, noting that Patricia Blagojevich's Series 7 license to sell securities makes her an apt candidate for such work. The affidavit says the governor had harsh words for the president-elect should he not help the Blagojeviches. Calling Obama a \"motherf---er,\" the governor scoffs incredulously at the idea of appointing his preferred candidate without a kickback, the affidavit says. \"For nothing? F--- him,\" he said, according to the affidavit. The next day, the affidavit says, Rod Blagojevich firmly ruled out appointing Obama's preferred successor. \"They're not willing to give me anything except appreciation. F--- them,\" the affidavit quotes him as saying. CNN's Eliott C.

Joran van der Sloot awaits transfer from the Netherlands to Aruba in November. He later was released. The exact location of that meeting was not  disclosed, but van der Sloot's attorney, Joe Tacopina, said his client has \"agreed to answer any questions.\" In the video that aired Sunday on Dutch television, van der Sloot, a suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Holloway, told a man he was with the Alabama teen on an Aruban beach when she apparently died and that a friend of his with a boat disposed of Holloway's body. Van der Sloot later said the statements were lies, and on Monday, Tacopina said the video contains \"no admission of a crime.\" The lawyer said facts in the case contradict two assertions van der Sloot made in the video, including that the boat-owner friend mentioned wasn't in Aruba in May 2005.  Watch how video has brought new interest in case \u00bb . Meanwhile, prosecutors are still awaiting a decision from a three-judge appellate panel on the nearby Caribbean island of Curacao as to whether van der Sloot can be arrested in reaction to the video. The chief prosecutor in Aruba, Hans Mos, was denied an initial attempt to arrest van der Sloot by the investigating judge last Sunday. The judge determined that numerous pretrial detentions of van der Sloot in the past have created a \"high bar\" that current circumstances do not meet. The prosecutor appealed the judge's decision on Tuesday, and the appellate panel will have eight days to respond. Holloway disappeared while visiting Aruba with about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama, and was last seen leaving a nightclub with van der Sloot and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe.

The scene of the plane crash in Mexico City was one of panic and confusion, witnesses said. Radar tapes show that the Lear 45 -- carrying three crew members and six passengers from San Luis Potosi -- was flying just 4.15 nautical miles behind a Boeing 767-300 at 6:45 p.m. November 4, Luis Tellez said. The International Civil Aviation Organization calls for a separation of at least 6 nautical miles between a heavy jet like the Boeing and a medium-weight jet like the Lear to ensure that turbulence does not affect the smaller plane's control, Tellez said. The flight controller in Mexico City recognized that the separation was insufficient and, at 6:44 p.m., told the Lear jet to reduce its speed, but \"the Lear jet didn't begin to decelerate significantly until a minute and 12 seconds later,\" Tellez said. \"The transcript of the [cockpit voice recorder] reveals that, in this period, the plane entered a turbulence that surprised the crew members, and the pilot attributed it to the wake of the plane ahead,\" Tellez said. The pilot asked the co-pilot, who had more experience, to take over, but he was unable to regain control, Tellez said. \"We know that the crew recognized the presence of the turbulence provoked by the wake of the plane that preceded it and, immediately after recognizing it, the plane gave a sharp turn and initiated its descent at a pronounced angle that culminated in its impact on the ground,\" he said. The Boeing, which weighs 175 tons, is classified as a heavy plane. The 8-year-old Lear, which weighed 9.5 tons, was classified as a medium-weight plane, though it was on the light end of that scale, Tellez said. \"Therefore, it is more vulnerable than most medium-sized planes to the phenomenon of turbulence,\" he said. Officials said last week that the left engine fell off the plane before it crashed. Lab tests found no traces of alcohol or drugs in either pilot and no evidence of sabotage or explosives, he said. Scrutiny of the wreckage has found no indication that anything was wrong with the plane or its engines, he said. But the investigation did find \"presumed deficiencies\" in the pilot's certification to operate a Lear jet, Tellez said. Audio from the cockpit voice recorder \"shows the lack of familiarity\" of the pilot, Capt. Martin de Jesus Oliva Perez, with the instruments in the cabin, he added. Among the plane's passengers was Interior Secretary Juan Camilo Mourino, the nation's second most-powerful official and a confidant of President Felipe Calderon's. The plane crashed in Mexico City traffic and erupted in flames, killing five people on the ground and injuring 14 in addition to killing the nine people aboard. Tellez said the final report, which will take several months to complete, will include studies carried out in a NASA simulator to confirm whether the wake was responsible.", "61584cc33fdcf488f9dcc0e804ed8cc46779dd86": "(CNN) -- An ancient race that lived 2,700 years ago in the Gobi Desert may have been among the first to use cannabis for medical or religious purposes. Researchers believe an ancient Gushi shaman may have consumed or burned pot for medical or religious purposes. Nearly two pounds of the plant was found stashed in the tomb of a Gushi shaman. It was high in the chemical compounds that provide its psychoactive properties. \"It had evidence of the chemical attributes of cannabis used as a drug,\" said Dr. Ethan Russo, an author of a study published in the Journal of Experimental Botany. \"It could have been for pain control. It could have been for other medicinal properties. It could have been used as an aid to divination.\" The Gushi people were a Caucasian race with light hair and blue eyes who likely migrated thousands of years ago from the steppes of Russia to what is now China. A nomadic people, they were accomplished horsemen and archers. Chinese archaeologists excavating a network of 2,500 tombs near the town of Turpan in the Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region unearthed the shaman's grave, which contained the cannabis, along with a trove of artifacts such as bridles, archery equipment and a rare harp. The shaman is thought to have been about 45 years old when he died. Many of the bodies recovered in the area were found in an incredibly well-preserved, almost mummified condition. The shaman, however, was a skeleton. \"The deceased was laid out on the bottom of this tomb on a little bier,\" Russo said. \"This individual seemed to be very high status because of the variety and quality of the grave goods, including the equestrian equipment, the archery equipment and the large amount of cannabis.\" Russo said no pipe for smoking the cannabis was found in the shaman's tomb. Researchers think he might have eaten the cannabis or possibly put it on a burning fire to create fumes. They don't think it was used to make hemp clothing or rope, as some other early cultures did. Genetic analysis of the plant suggests it was cultivated rather than gathered from the wild. This find is not the first or the oldest example of ancient people using cannabis, but it may be the best studied. \"There may have been older finds of cannabis, but not with this level of scientific investigation attached to them,\" Russo said.", "3613b2756cad74f9310641445b55eb2f02fe0d5b": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A child cries from hunger, but no tears come from her swollen eyes. Zimbabwean clinics have been overwhelmed by the cholera epidemic, according to aid organizations. Malnutrition has left this baby born in Zimbabwe fighting for her life. She is the face of an unfolding crisis in a country once known as Africa's bread basket. Today a loaf of bread costs 35 million worthless Zimbabwean dollars, and people are forced to sift through garbage piles for any morsel of food. Others huddle for warmth around a fire burning inside the shell of a broken-down van. All of these images were captured on video recently smuggled out of Zimbabwe by Solidarity Peace Trust, a South African human rights group. Zimbabwe's government maintains that the situation is being exaggerated by the West in an effort to exert pressure on President Robert Mugabe to leave office. But the World Health Organization (WHO) says the desperate situation has triggered a widening cholera outbreak that has killed 775 people and infected more than 15,000. \"You have to eat in the same place you sleep right next to the buckets, the same buckets that we used as toilets,\" one cholera patient says on the video. \"There is no water to bathe.\"  Watch shocking footage of Zimbabwe's humanitarian crisis (Discretion advised) \u00bb . And little to eat. Women foraging for food in the bush find dry branches with only a few berries. \"This packet of juice will be my supper tonight,\" one woman says. Zimbabwe's main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai -- who is still trying to form a unity government with Mugabe under a recent power-sharing deal -- said the situation can only be addressed once a \"legitimate government\" is in place. \"Once there is a legitimate government, it is up to that government to deal with the problems the country is facing, which are quite wide-ranging,\" Tsvangirai told CNN on Wednesday. \"But the immediate intervention of the health crisis has exacerbated the situation to the extent that it has now become an international crisis.\" The WHO says the current cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe has a high fatality rate because sufferers are either not able to reach health centers in time or because health centers lack the capacity to treat the cases.  View image gallery of Zimbabwe cholera crisis \u00bb . \"The epidemic is clearly on the increase,\" Dr. Eric Laroche, a WHO official in Harare, told CNN on Wednesday. \"I think it's going to last for several months.\" In addition to the WHO, the Red Cross has responded to the outbreak and is sending staff and medical supplies into Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's main hospitals have all but shut down and the small clinics equipped by international aid organizations are overcrowded and unable to cope with the thousands of cholera patients. Health workers inside Zimbabwe believe scores are dying at home. Laroche said the WHO is receiving cooperation from the government, but the health care system is abysmal. \"The quality of the care, the supplies that come inside Zimbabwe, also need to be restored,\" Laroche said. \"So there's a lot of work to do, because the health system is collapsing for the time being.\" One Zimbabwean health care worker, who would not show his face on the video, said he fears the death toll will skyrocket. \"People are dying even at the health institution,\" he said. \"It's beyond control. We are going to witness so many deaths in the coming weeks.\" He expressed frustration that so many people are dying from cholera, a disease that \"is both preventable and curable.\" \"Nobody should die from cholera,\" he said. \"We are quite unfortunate.\" Zimbabwe, already experiencing an economic crisis, was struck with the raging water-borne cholera in August. Health experts say the battle against the disease can only be won if Harare has adequate water-treating chemicals and disposes of refuse properly. Zimbabwe's information minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said Tuesday that the country has enough chemicals to purify water and enough money to buy pipes to mend sanitation lines. He maintained that the outbreak is under control, blaming the West for causing the crisis as an excuse for military intervention. International leaders -- including U.S. President George W. Bush, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Kenyan premier Raila Odinga -- have recently called for Mugabe to step down for failing to contain the cholera outbreak. Frustration inside Zimbabwe is building. Last week, doctors and nurses protested over the lack of medical supplies and other resources at the country's hospitals. Labor unions have protested over the deteriorating economy. Even soldiers once shielded from economic hardships by the Mugabe regime went on a rampage last week when they were unable to access wages from the country's banks. Human rights activist Elinor Sisulu, who has lived and worked in Zimbabwe and now coordinates civil action outside the country, called on African leaders to demand Mugabe step down before Zimbabwe explodes. \"In any population where you have high levels of desperation, anger and ... people arrive at the conclusion that we've tried a peaceful political process and this is not working, then anything can happen,\" she said.

Most Republicans oppose any such plan, saying it would give too much power to the government. They've also questioned Daschle's recent work for a Washington lobbying firm. His wife, Linda Daschle, is a registered lobbyist for a firm that includes health care clients.

Spencer Pearson and his 15-year-old son, Bryce, bought a 150-square-foot van in Germany for their European excursion. Living out of the van meant \"no reservations, no packing and unpacking of suitcases, no strange beds,\" Pearson said. Modern amenities weren't amiss on the van, which included everything from the Internet and entertainment to a complete bath and kitchen, and there were occasional hotel stays and meals out that made the trip more pleasant. The simple life also enticed Deborah Greant and her husband to trade in their Calgary, Canada, home for an RV. Both she and her husband have neuromuscular problems and needed extra help taking care of their large home. Since moving into a 240-square-foot RV, they can manage the house themselves. \"We didn't want to be owned by our things,\" Greant said. \"We jettisoned pretty much everything except things from former generations.\" While two people living in an RV can be tight, imagine a family of six trying to do the same. Mounting living expenses and a job relocation prompted the Chervenkas to sell their home and move into a 32-foot RV. Two pets came along, too. The Chervenkas weren't forced to do this. Their goal was to become debt-free and save money for their children's college educations. When pilot Tim Chervenka got transferred to Charlotte, North Carolina, the family set up camp in a 32-foot RV. The temporary situation turned into a permanent one. The family said goodbye to paying a first and second mortgage and pricey utilities. They now pay only $500 a month, utilities included. \"It's made such an adjustment in our personal life without the juggling,\" Cindy Chervenka said. \"We have so much more family time. It's a good feeling.\" Cindy Chervenka has some advice for others thinking of a drastic downsizing: \"Step out of your comfort zone and try it. We didn't plan on doing this full-time, but once we discovered it, we thought, 'hey we can do this forever!' Until you step out and try it, you'll think it's not doable.\"", "2404916090cce8e9949e22ada3d68b2bf61e43ad": "(CNN) -- The rapper Common wants to take hip-hop in a new direction, he says, and he has an unsuspecting ally -- President-elect Barack Obama. Common says he was looking for a new sound on his eighth album, \"Universal Mind Control.\" Obama \"is going to change hip-hop for the better,\" predicted the rapper, whose eighth album, \"Universal Mind Control\" (G.O.O.D. Music/Geffen), hits shelves Tuesday. \"I really do believe we as hip-hop artists pick up what's going on in the world and try to reflect that,\" he told CNN, outlining his belief that mainstream as well as so-called \"conscious\" rappers -- the more socially aware -- will pick up on what he sees as the more optimistic prospects of an Obama presidency. \"I think hip-hop artists will have no choice but to talk about different things and more positive things, and try to bring a brighter side to that because, even before Barack, I think people had been tired of hearing the same thing,\" he said. Likewise, \"Universal Mind Control,\" with its hook-heavy, synthed-out tracks, represents a \"broadening\" of hip-hop's audience -- one that demands evolution rather than hackneyed revamps of old beats, rhythms and rhymes, Common said.  Listen to clips from the album and Common's interview with CNN.com \u00bb . Not that Common, born Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr., is altogether removed from the temptations of his hip-hop brethren. He serves as a spokesman for Lincoln Navigator and purports on his new album to \"rebel in YSL,\" a reference to designer Yves Saint Laurent. Money is also a weakness, as Common -- No. 14 on Forbes magazine's 2008 list of richest rappers -- regularly invokes the greenbacks he makes and spends. iReport.com: Talk Grammy Awards and more showbiz with Todd . Still, Common has come at hip-hop from a different angle from many of his colleagues. He was generally considered \"underground\" until he linked up with Kanye West, who produced his albums \"Be\" (2005) and \"Finding Forever\" (2007). Even now, while paying homage at mainstream hip-hop's altar, the Chicago-born lyricist also enters parishes where most rappers wouldn't be seen. He's helped front movements for HIV/AIDS awareness and vegetarianism, and he's written two children's books emphasizing the importance of self-esteem. Lyrically, violence has never been his thing; soft-drug use has been mentioned but rarely glamorized; he removed homophobic references from his lyrics years ago; and while there have been hints of misogyny and the occasional N-word in his verses, neither has been a staple of his rhymes. \"I've always been conscious, honestly,\" he said. \"I made a choice on this album, 'Universal Mind Control,' to really make some music that was bright, that would be a little more lighthearted, just because of what was going on in the world.\" Read more from the interview . With a few exceptions, his latest lyrics are consummate Common. In his beat poet's cadence, the 36-year-old rhymesmith aggressively courts the ladies, personifies hip-hop, aggrandizes himself and his hometown (lovingly, \"the Chi\"), and respectfully doles out props to hip-hop's forefathers -- most notably to Afrika Bambaataa on the album's title track.  Hear the title track \u00bb . The album's sound, however, is atypical, moving -- sometimes jerkily -- from club-banger to anthem to ballad to Top 40. The latter even runs counter to the opening verse of \"Everywhere\": \"No pop, no pop, no pop, no pop/We gonna do this thing till the sky just drop.\" But the sound is part of \"a whole new sound and a new movement\" in hip-hop, something he explored out of disdain for repetition and predictability, he said. That might explain Kanye West's relative absence on \"Universal Mind Control.\" The Louis Vuitton don appears on only one track, the pop-drenched \"Punch Drunk Love.\" But West has long been credited, even by Common, with bringing his fellow Chicagoan to the mainstream after \"Be\" and \"Finding Forever\" went gold and leapt up the Billboard 200. Of course, it's not all Kanye, said Common. \"I'm a true believer that it all boils down to the music, because Kanye can endorse something, and if people don't like it they ain't gonna get with it -- regardless of whoever endorses it,\" he said. He compared his working relationship with West to the collaboration he enjoyed with The Neptunes' Pharrell Williams on \"Universal Mind Control.\" Williams, whom Common casually likened to Quincy Jones, pushed him lyrically, much like West did, he said. Between Williams and Mr. DJ -- who composed backbeats for some of OutKast's biggest hits -- Common arrived at the evolution he sought, he added. Common also is plotting a change, or at least a detour, in his career path. Though his past cinematic endeavors have been primarily gangster flicks, Common has landed a role in the upcoming \"Terminator Salvation\" and could play Green Lantern in \"Justice League: Mortal\" should the derailed movie get back on track. \"I would truly love to go increasingly in the acting direction,\" he said. \"My goal is to be a movie star. I want to be at Will Smith's level. I want to be co-leading with Leonardo DiCaprio.\" Fear not, Common fans. The aspiring thespian is confident he can pull off both, though hip-hop might ride sidecar to the silver screen. Acting, he said, seems to improve his music. \"I don't take as much time overthinking it. Actually, since 'Be' I've been working on films and each album has been expanding and increasing, so I feel like I would still make music, but it wouldn't be the main gig,\" he said. Selling albums, Common said, is about more than good music, and though he stands proudly by the music he made pre-West, he concedes he didn't do enough to claw his way up from the underground. \"After you make good, quality music, then it's your job to go out there and promote it and to market it and to get it out there to the people. I feel like I wasn't doing that early on,\" he said. \"Now I am, and I feel like I'm growing as a songwriter and working with producers that are very incredible, so I feel all that is contributing to me getting the recognition that I'm getting.\"", "da1a3a3a0ff29af36ae21485ba1197c7949c0a67": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The conviction of a terrorist doctor in the UK exposes how any section of society can become radicalized, a top police officer said Tuesday. Bilal Abdulla is shown being arrested after the attack at Glasgow Airport. Bilal Abdulla was well-educated and working as a doctor when he carried out his plot to plant car bombs in London -- rather than unemployed or with feelings of being outside or abandoned by society as has been seen before in the UK. Born in southern England, his family moved to Iraq when he was a child. He grew up in the capital during Saddam Hussein's rule and went to the University of Baghdad before returning to Britain to attend Cambridge University. The Cambridge-educated graduate became a doctor working in the National Health Service where the maxim is to treat anyone regardless of the ability to pay. Deputy Assistant Commissioner John McDowall, who heads the Counter Terrorism Command, said Abdulla and Kafeel Ahmed -- who died from burn injuries after he crashed a jeep into Glasgow International Airport, Scotland -- reveal a new type of terrorist. He told the UK's Press Association: \"These individuals were not on our radar and that in itself is very interesting. When you look at the profile of these individuals they are very different from the terrorists we have dealt with in this country before - being professional people. McDowell added they were probably inspired by al Qaeda in Iraq but developed their plan in Britain without help from abroad. \"I think this was a group that was largely self-motivated, came up with the ideas themselves, tutored themselves through the Internet. I don't think they received significant training elsewhere, which is unusual from what we have had in the past,\" he told PA. Abdulla's motive, prosecutors said, was revenge for the bloodshed in Iraq. Prosecutor Jonathan Laidlaw said: 'There is no longer a conventional approach to terrorism. There are no rules to be broken any more, nothing can be taken for granted.\" Abdulla was found guilty Tuesday of conspiracy to murder and conspiring to cause explosions. He will be sentenced to Woolwich Crown Court, London, on Wednesday. The jury rejected his defense that he had planned only to set fire to cars in central London as a way of highlighting the plight of Iraqis.", "47b278801970ecf6b900a8c21118c89f713aa8a3": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- An engine fell off a Mexican government jet before it crashed, killing the second-highest official in the nation, the Cabinet member in charge of the investigation said Saturday. Firefighters at the scene of the crash Tuesday night in Mexico City. Officials also said they have ruled out the possibility that the crash was caused by a bomb. \"There is no trace of explosives on the plane wreckage or the [crash] site,\" said Luis Tellez, Mexican secretary of communication and transportation. Interior Minister Juan Camilo Mourino, former deputy attorney general Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos and six others onboard were killed in the crash. At least five others on the ground died, and others were reported missing. Officials said 40 people were injured. Camilo Mourino and Santiago Vasconcelos had been instrumental in the war on drugs, leading to widespread speculation among Mexicans that drug lords orchestrated the crash. But Mexican authorities have said there is no indication that foul play was involved. The government Learjet 45 was traveling at 500 kmh (310 mph) when it crashed in central Mexico City as it approached Benito Juarez International Airport. Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Mexico's director of airports and auxiliary services, said the jet's left engine fell off when the plane was traveling between 250 and 300 kmh (150 to 186 mph), according to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. An examination of the wreckage indicates that the engines were functioning at high speed, Lopez Meyer said. Tallez said the day after the crash that the Learjet 45 did not explode in the air because when that happens, pieces of the airplane are scattered over a wide area. But the wreckage in this instance was limited to a small area, he said. Tellez also said Wednesday that the pilot did not report an emergency, Notimex said. A recording released Wednesday of what Mexican officials said was dialogue between the pilot and the airport control tower did not appear to have an emergency call from the aircraft. Officials have vowed to make all aspects of the investigation public.

Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, right, and U.S.  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice speak Thursday. \"Carried to its state of conclusion, it will produce a state of Palestine,\" Rice, referring to negotiations in the wake of last year's U.S. summit on Israel-Palestinian peace in Annapolis, Maryland, said at a joint news conference with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, West Bank. Rice is on her eighth trip to the region since the Annapolis summit. On Thursday, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the Bush administration does not \"think that it's likely that it (a peace agreement) would happen before the end of the year.\" Rice said Friday that she realizes the lack of a peace agreement in the months following the Annapolis summit had caused some concerns that talks had stalled or might fail, but \"it's quite the opposite -- the Annapolis process has laid the foundation for the eventual establishment for the state of Palestine.\" The purpose of her current trip, Rice said, was \"to advance the Annapolis process,\" and while she did not speculate on a timetable for the future of the process or offer specifics on peace talks, she added, \"I've seen them move forward a great deal in the past year.\" Both Israeli and Palestinian officials have expressed doubts about achieving a peace agreement before President Bush leaves office, but until this week U.S. officials had been more optimistic in their public comments. Speaking in Israel on Thursday, Rice blamed part of the inability to secure a deal on recent political changes in Israel, which she noted is \"in the midst of elections.\" With Abbas on Friday, she emphasized that the commitment expressed by Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert when they signed an agreement to work toward a peace deal by the end of 2008 is still strong. \"I hope that the tremendous commitment (by both sides) is fully understood,\" Rice said. While Rice did not discuss any impact a new administration in Washington might have on the process, she said, \"The United States really does understand why the Palestinian people want unity.\" Israel in recent months has seen political upheaval. Olmert resigned in September amid allegations of corruption. Kadima Party leader and Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni gave up efforts to form a new coalition government late last month and is seeking to hold early general elections, which could be held in February, Livni's spokesman has said. Olmert will continue to lead as Israel's interim prime minister until a successor assumes power either by forming a coalition in the current Knesset or through general elections. However, it is unclear whether he will be able to strike a deal with the Palestinians before Israel forms its new government.

Much of Male, capital of the Maldives, was flooded following the 2004 tsunami. Mohamed \"Anni\" Nasheed, a former political prisoner, was sworn in Tuesday after he unseated Asia's longest-serving leader in the country's first multi-party elections two weeks ago. He inherits an island nation with several problems. Foremost among them: the very likely possibility that the Maldives will sink under water if the current pace of climate change keeps raising sea levels. The Maldives is an archipelago of almost 1,200 coral islands located south-southwest of India. Most of the islands lie just 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) above sea level. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has forecast a rise in sea levels of at least 7.1 inches (18 cm) by the end of the century. The island was badly hit by the December 2004 tsunami, which killed an estimated 273,800 people and left thousands missing across Asia and Africa. In the Maldives itself, at least 82 people were killed and 26 unaccounted for from a population just over 270,000, according to the Maldives Disaster Management Center. Sixty-nine islands were completely flooded and a further 30 islands half flooded. The capital of Male was also flooded, although sea walls protected it from further devastation. The government has calculated that creating a similar barrier around the rest of the country would cost too much.  Watch Maldives president vow to save the nation. \u00bb . And so the tourist nation, which has white sandy beaches that lure well-heeled Westerners, wants to set aside some of the $1 billion a year it receives from tourism and spend that money on buying a new homeland. \"We will invest in land,\" Nasheed said. \"We do not want to end up in refugee tents if the worst happens.\" Nasheed's government has said that it has broached the idea with several countries and found them to be \"receptive.\" Lands owned by Sri Lanka and India are possibilities because the countries have similar cultures, cuisine and climate as the Maldives. Australia is also being considered because of the vast unoccupied land it owns. Climate change is not the only challenge the new president will have to tackle, though. Other thorny issues include rising unemployment, corruption and a staggering drug epidemic. By some estimates, one of every three Maldivian youth uses drugs. Maldivians also worry that their tiny secular nation of 370,000 Muslims could fall prey to the reach of Islamic radicals. A bombing in Male, attributed to Islamic extremists, wounded 12 tourists in September 2007. \"We have made many pledges,\" Nasheed said in his inaugural address. \"The citizens gave their majority vote to us to implement these.\" Nasheed said he will work to bring affordable housing and medical care for everyone. Twenty-one percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Nasheed, a 41-year-old one-time journalist, was among the fiercest critics of former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who came to power in 1978 and ruled the Maldives for 30 years. He won the six previous elections as the only candidate on the ballot. Nasheed contended that Gayoom ruled with an iron fist, crushing dissent, amassing wealth and stacking his administration with friends and relatives. Gayoom's critics say his government enforced a system of 'apartheid' tourism that banned most Maldivians from nearly 90 luxury resorts. Shortly before election day, an auditors' report said that millions of dollars were improperly accounted for by Gayoom's government. He disputed the findings. Nasheed was arrested several times in the last 15 years and held as a political prisoner. Five candidates challenged Gayoom for the presidency in elections held on October 9. Gayoom said he needed a seventh five-year term to see through the reforms he put in place. But critics said Gayoom instituted democratic reforms -- and legalized political parties -- only after violent protests in 2004 and 2005. Nasheed and Gayoom ended up in a runoff -- with Nasheed winning 54 percent of the votes to Gayoom's 46 percent in the October 28 race. \"No other citizens in the world in modern times have changed a 30-year-old regime so peacefully,\" Nasheed said in address. As the clock struck 12 a.m. Tuesday, Gayoom quietly exited the presidential office. \"I deeply regret any actions on my part ... (that) led to unfair treatment, difficulty or injustice for any Maldivian,\" he said in a farewell speech. \"From anyone who had had to face any such unfair treatment, difficulty or injustice, I sincerely seek forgiveness.\" Maldivians took to the streets in a celebration that carried into the wee hours of the morning. Residents danced to the beats of local bands and feasted on rice and mutton. They decked the cobbled roads of Male with the red-and-green flag of the Maldives and the yellow banner of Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic Party. \"We cannot believe that this is happening. I have spent more than half my life in exile in Sri Lanka,\" said Nasheed's close confidant Mohammed Naseem. Journalist Sumon K.

But what happens when the one disagreeing with you shares your bedroom? Here are ten tips to help you make it to November 4 without resorting to the taser gun: . 1. Assess the situation: While one of you might not care that much, the other might be eating, drinking, and sneezing the party line. Acknowledge who feels most strongly, who's just having fun, and whether or not thoughtful discourse is as likely as pigs (with or without lipstick!) flying. 2. Find common ground: Establish that you each are trying to do what you think is best to move this country forward. Maybe you can even agree on an issue or two, and join forces in talking about your mutual passion. (Note: this becomes less effective if you see eye-to-eye only about oatmeal tariffs.) 3. Establish boundaries: Maybe it's no political talk at the table or no ranting email forwards from Aunt Phyllis. You might even agree that you'll freeze discussion if one of you cries for mercy (a \"safe\" word is good for this: who knew that political arguments were so much like S & M?) Either way, ground rules are essential to keep things from getting ugly. 4. R-E-S-P-E-C-T: Now's the time to channel your inner Miss Manners. Offensive taunts, passive-aggressive digs and -- most certainly-- flying fondue pots are all out of the question. 5. Don't overpersonalize: Your beloved is still, for the most part, who he always was. And the vast majority of those qualities have nothing to do with who gets his hanging chad in the voting booth. 6. Drive to distraction: Now is the time to take up cooking together, not to spend all night with Wolf Blitzer. Choose a classic movie over debate analysis and your 80s playlist over talk radio. And don't even think of bringing your guy to that fundraiser! 7. Find your outlet: If it helps you to hang out in partisan chat rooms all day, have at it. Just make sure you know the difference between blowing off steam and getting yourself worked up, or you're liable to be worse off than you started. 8. Keep it out of the bedroom: Say good night without politics-- unless, of course, the conflict adds some spice! But ixnay on the bouffant wig and red glasses.... as well as the Joe Biden undies. 9. Make an election night plan: Whether you'll be at viewing parties in opposite cities or side-by-side with earpieces and laptops, agree in advance whether you'll spend the evening, and morning, together. Avoid the potential pitfall of letting the night unfold spontaneously -- after all, one of you will be stewing while the other is squealing. 10. Do a reality check: For every couple engaged in a playful red-versus-blue showdown, there's another that must acknowledge red flags about opposing world views. Don't minimize what might be a larger problem of philosophical incompatibility-- or it could be a very long four years to come.

Marchers protest recent U.S. missile strikes on the Pakistani tribal areas. The attack, which occurred in the Mir Ali subdivision in the village of Ali Khel, was one of several to hit the country Saturday. Six people were injured in Saturday's attack, the fourth suspected U.S. strike on Pakistani soil in November. The names of the victims have not been released. It is also not known why the house was targeted. Elsewhere, three people were killed and 11 were injured in an explosion inside a mosque in northwest Pakistan's tribal region, a government official said. The explosion happened just after 4 p.m. (6 a.m. ET), leaving the Hangu district mosque inside Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province in ruins, said Omer Faraz Khan, deputy superintendent of Hangu. He said rescuers were trying to save people trapped under the debris. It was not immediately clear how many people were inside the mosque at the time of the blast. Police were investigating the explosion, which was detonated using a homemade timer, Khan said. Hours later, three bombs exploded about 10 p.m. (noon ET) outside a stadium in Lahore where a music festival was being held, police Inspector Muntzir Kazmi said. A 13-year-old was injured, but it was unknown whether the victim was a boy or girl. This week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson to lodge a formal protest against another suspected U.S. missile strike on its territory, an act Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani called a violation of his nation's sovereignty.  Watch Gilani say his country has had enough of U.S. attacks \u00bb . Wednesday's strike in the Bannu region of Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province left five dead and seven wounded. That attack was farther inside Pakistani territory than previous attacks. The attack targeted a home outside the tribal areas that U.S. intelligence says have become a haven for Taliban and al Qaeda fighters battling U.S. and NATO troops in neighboring Afghanistan. The U.S. government has not acknowledged hitting targets within Pakistan, an ally in the war on al Qaeda launched after the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. However, Pakistan's government has repeatedly complained about the strikes. Gilani took to the floor of the parliament and renewed his condemnation of the attacks Thursday but added that he thinks they will be controlled when President-elect Barack Obama takes office. In October, the foreign ministry summoned Patterson to lodge a \"strong\" protest on continuing missile attacks and said they should be stopped immediately. At the time, a missile strike from a suspected U.S. drone on a compound in South Waziristan killed 20 people. Pakistan's government said the attacks cost lives and undermine public support for its counterterrorism efforts. The U.S.-led coalition and NATO, based in Afghanistan, have been seeking a way to effectively battle militants who are launching attacks from Pakistan's swath of tribal areas along the border. They have become frustrated with Islamabad over the years, saying it is not being active enough against militants, a claim Pakistan denies.

A soldier is welcomed home from Iraq by his son at Fort Stewart, Georgia, earlier this month. The lawsuit, filed by the National Veterans Legal Services Program, accuses the Army of illegally cutting off benefits to thousands of veterans and their families by refusing to assign a proper disability rating to those veterans after they had been discharged with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As a result, the veterans have been denied benefits, including, among other things, lifetime monthly disability payments and free medical care for  themselves and their families. \"I experience firsthand the horrors of war\" said Juan Perez, an Iraq veteran and one of five plaintiffs in the lawsuit. \"My expectation was that the military would be there for me, and my country would be there for me. Instead, the way I was treated felt more like a slap to the face.\" All disabled veterans are assigned a disability rating from zero to 100 percent. According to the Legal Services Program, a rating of at least 30 percent is required to qualify for benefits such as monthly disability payments and free health care. Soldiers receiving less than a 30 percent rating are  entitled only to a one-time lump sum severance payment after being discharged. On October 14, the Defense Department ordered the Army to assign at least a 50 percent rating to all soldiers discharged with PTSD in the future. The lawsuit seeks to provide full benefits to all veterans discharged with PTSD in the past six years. A Rand Corp. study released in April indicated that nearly 20 percent of all military service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have reported symptoms of PTSD or major depression.", "545a6e2afd63930acd466d4023300ee0f99aff87": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A bomb attached to a car carrying an Iraqi army general exploded Saturday afternoon, killing the driver and wounding the general and a bystander, an Interior Ministry official said.

President Bush and Laura Bush welcome Barack and Michelle Obama to the White House on Monday. \"The president and the president-elect had a long meeting, described by the president as good, constructive, relaxed and friendly,\" White House press secretary Dana Perino said in a statement. \"The president enjoyed his visit with the president-elect, and he again pledged a smooth transition to the next administration.\" Perino said the two discussed national and international issues but did not provide specifics of the conversation. Bush also gave Obama a tour of the White House's living quarters, including the Lincoln bedroom. Bush and Obama held a private meeting in the Oval Office, while the first lady gave incoming first lady Michelle Obama a tour of the residence. The president and president-elect walked together along the Colonnade by the Rose Garden before entering the Oval Office together. They briefly waved to reporters along the way. Obama and Bush were not expected to speak on camera after their meeting. The two met in the Oval Office for just over an hour. When President George H.W. Bush hosted President-elect Bill Clinton after the 1992 election, the two talked for nearly two hours. Monday's meeting was a historic formality, but it was also a time for serious talks.

A day earlier, a leader of Obama's transition team said the president and president-elect were expected to discuss \"a broad range of issues,\" focusing on the economy. \"It's clear that we need to stabilize the economy, to deal with the financial meltdown that's now spreading across the rest of the economy. The auto industry is really, really back on its heels,\" transition team leader John Podesta told CNN's \"Late Edition\" on Sunday. Podesta said Obama will push Congress to enact \"at least part\" of an economic package before he takes office in January, but said the problems Americans face need short- and long-term approaches. The president and president-elect also were expected to talk about national security and the war in Iraq. Go inside the Oval Office .

David Craig says there's growing support for recognition of gay unions and gay marriage. LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- My battle for marriage equality began in 1990, after my partner, Brian Binder, and I had a commitment ceremony. The ceremony was held at the end of a conference for Parents and Friends of Lesbian and Gays and was attended by more than 300 friends and members of both our families. We were featured in a couple of books on gay marriage because the concept was so new at the time. We also registered as domestic partners and entered into every possible form of legal recognition available at the time. A few years later, Brian was visiting his parents in Nevada to inform them that he was giving up his battle with AIDS. Something went horribly wrong, and he was rushed to the hospital. I flew there immediately. As his caretaker, I knew his medical condition and had been involved in every medical decision. We had shared the joy of making a commitment to one another and the pain and suffering of a horrible disease. But when I arrived, I was told I could not see him because I was not \"family\" and because my legal documents were valid only in California. Even as I heard him calling out my name, they refused to let me see him because we were not married. Brian died in 1992. In 1995, I helped organize the first Freedom to Marry March in Los Angeles. Ten years later, the idea for A Day Without Gays was conceived. iReport.com: Are you taking part in \"A Day Without Gays?\" I was discussing same-sex marriage with Delia Fine, my colleague at the A&E Network. I proposed a gay version of Lysistrata, an ancient Greek satire about Athenian women who withheld sex from their husbands until they agreed to stop going to war. She replied, \"what if gays went on strike instead?\" and the idea was born. We convinced A&E to produce a movie based on the idea, which became a romantic comedy called \"Wedding Wars\" that aired on the network in 2006. Critics compared the film to \"A Day Without a Mexican,\" which led to the one-day protest by the Latino community called A Day Without Immigrants. In the wake of the passage of Proposition 8 in California, which banned same-sex marriage, I posted the event on Facebook. My fellow organizer, Steve Holzer, inspired by the Latino protests, suggested we call it A Day Without Gays. We soon discovered that other organizers had conceived of the same idea simultaneously, and we all agreed to schedule the protest for December 10, which is International Human Rights Day. A week later, Join The Impact, the group that organized City Hall rallies nationwide November 14, joined forces with us. Our goal is to raise awareness that marriage is a \"basic human right\" as declared by the U.S. Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia, the case that ended race-based restrictions on marriage. We believe that to deny gays and lesbians that right, and the 1,400 state and federal legal and economic benefits of marriage, is discrimination and in violation of the 14th Amendment. We are asking people who support us to \"call in gay\" to their workplace by taking the day off or to shut down their businesses. Our goal is to raise awareness that we are gay and lesbian Americans who work, own businesses, pay our taxes and support the economy to the tune of $712 billion a year, according to an analysis by Witeck-Combs Communications, a public relations agency that specializes in the gay and lesbian consumer market. This is a declaration that we take our rights seriously and demand full equality. Our Facebook site has had a million visitors, and more than 225,000 people indicate that they will or might participate. There are also more than 17,000 postings from participants who have taken the time to debate, support and/or deride these issues. There is still much to do. Thirty states have passed bans on same-sex marriage. Thirty states allow employers to fire someone based on sexual orientation, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Some states have instituted or are considering bans that directly or indirectly prevent gays and lesbians from adopting or fostering children. In addition, the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act by Congress in 1996 denies civil unions what Barack Obama's campaign described as the more than 1,100 benefits of marriage including immigration, taxation, Social Security and veteran's benefits. A recent Newsweek poll reflects that, for the first time, a majority of Americans now believe that gay and lesbian couples deserve recognition, with 55 percent supporting legally sanctioned unions. It found increased backing for inheritance and other rights and found that 39 percent favor gay marriage. The tide is clearly turning in our favor, and I believe that love, equality and support for all families will triumph. In the words of Tony Kushner, \"We will be citizens. The time has come.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Craig.", "1e2e597f0b417b2bc1c5dac6aec33ba4059962e3": "(CNN) -- A biker who posted videos of himself on YouTube performing stunts and speeding at up to 210 kph (130 mph) has been jailed after inadvertently confessing his misdemeanors to police. Sandor Ferenci posted video of himself online performing high-speed stunts. Sandor Ferenci, 28, was approached by police after a motorist saw him speeding on his powerful motorcycle and noted his registration number. When they called at his house in Oxfordshire, England, he unwittingly asked if they had seen his YouTube video -- prompting officers to search the Internet, where they found uploaded video of his hazardous riding. Ferenci was Monday sentenced to 12 weeks' jail after admitted two counts of dangerous driving at Oxford Crown Court. Judge Terence Maher told Ferenci that he had carried out \"lunatic and grossly irresponsible maneuvers at considerable speed,\" according to CNN affiliate ITN.

Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine released the audit on Thursday. The audit, released Thursday by Inspector General Glenn Fine, found the agents routinely submitted the overtime with the blessing of their managers from 2003 through 2007. The report says the excessive overtime totaled $7.8 million. \"The FBI inappropriately permitted employees to regularly claim overtime for activities that are not compensable as work, such as time spent eating meals, exercising more than 3 hours per week, and socializing,\" the report said. The socializing included going to movies and cocktail parties. The FBI promptly responded to the report, acknowledging the overtime policy was designed to encourage FBI employees to volunteer for Iraq duty, but should not have been used and has now been corrected. The 88-page report documenting the overtime issues found the FBI had initially approved the policy of paying for 16-hour days because conditions were harsh, there were few recreational opportunities and employees were always \"on call.\" But the audit said that violates federal pay guidelines. The FBI admitted that \"a flawed system was allowed to develop and remain in place too long,\" but it also sought to explain how the practice started. \"Early in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq FBI managers traveled to those war zones and saw first hand the challenges of a 24/7 threat environment. FBI employees lived with sniper attacks, mortar fire, and roadside bombs as part of their daily work environment. They attempted to adapt a long established domestic pay system for domestic law enforcement to unprecedented wartime assignments for FBI personnel.\" FBI agents in Iraq perform a variety of duties, according to the bureau's Web site. Agents interview suspected terrorists captured by the military; gather intelligence; collect evidence from crime scenes like car bombs or mass graves; and investigate crimes committed by Americans against Iraqis, as well as those that Iraqis commit against their fellow citizens. The inspector general's report said overtime pay was less excessive for FBI personnel in Afghanistan. The report also found that somewhat less excessive overtime was paid to agents from other Justice Department agencies who were sent to Iraq, including deputy marshals, and ATF and DEA agents.", "554d90afd0eac376d5d145f952e69688dd161e0b": "(CNN) -- CNN.com asked its users what they would do if they had all the money they needed.

Here are some of the edited responses that users around the world sent in. Reza Rohani of Tehran, Iran I would develop an NGO for popularization of science in Iran and some Central Asian countries. I would establish a publication house solely for the mentioned purpose and travel around the world to become more acquainted with different cultures and produce information packages and audio-visual documentaries to bring about a better understanding to people in different countries. E. Noonan of Natick, Massachusetts Oh, if I didn't have to work, I would spend my time on my dream of acting. Slogging around New York trying to get auditions, get into stage plays, get an agent -- all that sounds wonderful, as long as there is enough money to live on. Voice-over work and straight plays ... I would be in heaven. Frank Morganti  of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida I'd continue my work as a general contractor as my new hobby and wouldn't worry about money. Eric Scheffer of Bangkok, Thailand Retirees and financially independant people can still be of great use to society and communities. There is, for example, still a lot of poverty in Asia and Africa. Living costs are low, and retirees can live comfortably in Asia or Africa while participating in community work. One can, for example, teach simple things in the villages: hygiene, healthy cooking, etc. They can also give aid and simple loving care to small children. I would like to encourage retirees and financially independant people to become actively involved in such countries, and make a difference. There is no need for us or any healthy retiree to sit around and wait for death. The world needs us. Mandy Sickler of Marion, Indiana I'd finish my last year in college as a social work major and I would pay off all my college loans. Then I wish I had the means to load up a huge plane full of food, water and clothing/shoes to take to underprivileged countries and teach the people how to use the food I brought them. I would bring over educators to teach the people in these places about how to maintain their health. If I could, I would provide every child with the correct physical checkups and immunization shots. But this would be way out of reach for me to do; so if I didn't have to work, I would join the Peace Corps and work my butt off to help in any way I could. Roger Belanger of Tiverton, Rhode Island I'd be involved somehow in the theatre arts. My mid-life crisis hit about 10 years ago at 40 and I became involved in amateur theatre. If I were able to \"walk away from it all,\" I would dedicate my life to the performing arts in some fashion. Robert Madden of Parsons, Kansas . Buy a motor home and become a NASCAR fan on the road at a different track every weekend. Cicely Jette of Boston, Massachusetts I would develop the other side of my brain! I'm a research scientist and spend most of my time on data analysis, organization and logic. If I didn't have to work, I would learn to sing opera, how to speak French and Italian fluently, how to act, and I would spend all my free time in museums. That is ... until I overloaded my right brain and was driven back to the lab. Mark Albert  of Salmon River, Nova Scotia I would do the same as now: stay home with my kids. I have already decided to leave my job to be able to spend time with my kids in the most valuable time of their lives and mine. My wife works and makes enough for me to be able to do so and I am very grateful! Not enough parents stay home to raise their own kids. It rocks! Valerie Cathell of Dumfries, Virginia If I didn't have to work is tough to contemplate; however, I have fantasized about helping kids who are not able to read or are trapped in war-torn areas with no exposure to education. I am an educator currently, and I work in a small private school where funds are scarce. I understand limitations when there is not enough money. I would love to be able to touch the lives of kids who have no idea what an X-Box is or an iPod. Even in our environment, we have parents paying private tuition, who have the means to provide these \"often taken for granted\" things. But that is what they are: things. I worked with my fifth grade class to create a book for children in Uganda last year. After receiving the book, the liaison/facilitator of the program, sent our school a DVD of the children in Uganda. We shared this with our students and they were in awe of the way those kids actually lived. It was a life-changing experience and one that inspired me to seek ways to help others more often. Donald LaMarr Sr. of Antioch, California If I didn't have to work I would spend a significant portion of my time on the streets of Oakland, Berkley, and San Francisco, California, approaching and mentoring potential gang members in a different more positive direction. We have more than 1 million young African-American males who are either unemployed or underemployed who need some direction and someone to show them that there is a different way, a better culture than the gang culture. I  would help guide them back to our educational institutions. I would help to create hybrid educational institutions for the most incorrigible amongst them. These would not be the gladiator training camps that our youth prisons have become. These would be places where education and cultural development become mandatory and punishment for failing or resisting assimilation would be severe. That's what I would spend most of my time doing if I were retired. Jeffrey Young of McKinney, Texas For every person that needed help, I would stop and offer assistance. From one to the next, like a connect-the-dots on the map of the world just to see how I could band-aid my way across the globe in search of myself while making a difference from the smallest to the greatest challenges thrown at me. I would be a constant part of the solution. If I had nothing to worry about financially well, 90 percent of my problems would go away and then I would have the rest of my life to focus on the things that matter. I would go about developing relationships, experiencing the lives of others all while uplifting spirits of the world one soul at a time. I would breathe life from the Himalayas. Ride the currents in the waters of Costa Rica. Listen to jazz in New Orleans. Dip in the hot springs by Vancouver, British Columbia. Really. There is not enough time for me to talk about everything I would do. Instead, trust in that I would never waste a moment learning life all over again. Debra Ross of Rex, Georgia If I were the recipient of a sudden, legal windfall, I'd immediately quit my job and purchase an RV and travel to every state in America driving at a consistent, aggravating 40 mph.

An unidentified man talks on a cell phone in front of the Chung family's shop, Custom Cleaners. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals \"ruled resoundingly in favor of the Chung family and denied Mr. Roy Pearson's appeal of the case completely,\" said Christopher Manning, an attorney for the Chung family, who own Custom Cleaners. \"The D.C. Court of Appeals held that the trial court correctly ruled that Mr. Pearson's claims had no merit whatsoever,\" he added. The Chungs have \"some level of relief,\" Manning told CNN, \"but they won't count Mr. Pearson out for at least trying to torment them further\" with future appeals. \"We are very happy with the result and thank everyone for supporting us,\" Jin Chung said in a statement issued by Manning. \"The past three years have been very difficult, but we hope this nightmare is finally over.\" Pearson initially sought $67 million from the Chungs, calculating the amount by estimating years of legal violations, adding nearly $2 million in common law claims for fraud. The saga began in May 2005, when Pearson took several pairs of pants to Custom Cleaners for alteration as he prepared to start his new job as an administrative law judge. He alleged that among them was a pair of pants from a blue and maroon suit. When he came to collect his clothing, he said, the Chungs tried to give him a pair of charcoal gray pants that were not his. During a two-day trial, Pearson, who represented himself, said that when he took the pants to the cleaners, his financial situation was precarious: He had just been ordered to pay $12,000 in attorney's fees to his ex-wife, and his credit cards were at their limit. He claimed millions of dollars in attorney fees and millions more in punitive damages for what he called fraudulent advertising under the law. He also claimed that a sign in the store's window promising \"satisfaction guaranteed\" was an unconditional warranty that required the defendants to honor any claim by any customer without limitation. The Chungs' attorney argued that no reasonable person would interpret the signs to mean an unconditional promise of satisfaction. District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Judith Bartnoff agreed, ruling that Custom Cleaners did not violate the city's Consumer Protection Act. Manning, whose law firm handled the appeal on a pro bono basis for the Chungs, said the Chungs hope the \"vague and often unfair\" act will be changed \"so that others do not suffer like they did.\" In August 2007, the Chungs dropped their bid to recover legal costs in the hopes that Pearson would drop his appeal. Pearson may request that the appeal be heard again by the entire panel of D.C. Court of Appeals judges, Manning said. He also could petition to the U.S. Supreme Court for an appeal. \"It is the Chungs' hope that Mr. Pearson will not attempt to appeal any further and will end his frivolous and baseless attacks on the Chung family,\" Manning wrote in the statement. \"The 3\u00bd years this case has been pending and appealed have been very difficult for the Chungs,\" he said. \"They lost two of their dry cleaning stores and their realization of the American dream.\" He said the family wants to \"quietly return to their one remaining small dry-cleaning store ... to rebuild their lives.\" Pearson was taken off the bench in May 2007 while the lawsuit was pending and was not reappointed as an administrative law judge when his term expired. He filed a federal lawsuit in May 2008 to get his government job back, accusing city government and others of an \"unlawful demotion and subsequent termination.\" That suit remains pending.

Caylee Anthony, 2, has been missing since June in a case that has received national attention. At a news conference, Capt. Angelo Nieves, an Orange County Sheriff's Department commander, said investigators are looking into whether the tips, called in August 11, 12 and 13, were properly followed up. In one of those phone calls, the meter reader reported seeing a gray bag on the side of the road, Nieves said. On August 13, a deputy responded to the site and did a \"cursory search\" but found nothing, Nieves said. Casey Anthony, 22, faces charges including first-degree murder in the June disappearance of her daughter, Caylee, who was 2 at the time. Remains described as being those of a small child were found last week a half-mile from Casey Anthony's parents' home, in the area where the meter reader first directed police. Nieves said police were getting more information from the tipster and the deputy who responded to the tips. He said the department was investigating the \"thoroughness\" of the deputy's response but would not identify the deputy. The meter reader \"is not a suspect,\" Nieves said. \"He is a credible witness.\" Nieves' latest announcement is raising questions about whether police missed several chances to find remains believed to be Caylee's. The meter reader is not the only one, or the first, to have pointed police toward the site containing the remains. KioMarie Cruz, Casey Anthony's childhood friend, also told police to investigate the same wooded area near Hidden Oaks Elementary School a month before the meter reader, according to CNN affiliate WFTV. In an interview with detectives, according to WFTV, Cruz said that she and Anthony \"pretty much used to hang out there most of our time,\" would \"snack on food for hours\" and went there to \"get away from our parents.\" The sheriff's office followed up on that tip, but the wooded area was covered in floodwaters, preventing a search. Nieves said the water may have been present at the time of the meter reader's tips as well. Nieves also said Thursday that searchers combing the site after the skull's discovery had found \"significant skeletal remains\" consistent with those of a small child on the outer perimeter of the search area. The area will be enlarged, and processing and searching of the site will continue, probably into the weekend, he said. Some of the remains have been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, in an effort to identify them. Authorities have said the remains are believed to be Caylee's, but an identification is pending. Sheriff's spokesman Carlos Padilla said last week that authorities believe the remains are Caylee's for three reasons: No other children have been reported missing in the area; the remains are consistent with those of a child of Caylee's age; and the remains were found near the home of the grandparents, where the 2-year-old and her mother were living just before Caylee disappeared.

Ex-first lady Barbara Bush has been moved out of ICU and into a regular room. Bush, 83, was in good spirits and was joking with hospital staffers, the Methodist Hospital spokeswoman said. She was being fed intravenously. Her doctor said earlier she will be allowed no food by mouth for about a week, to avoid possibly stretching her abdominal area. The former first lady showed up at Methodist's emergency room Tuesday night complaining of severe abdominal pain, Dr. Patrick Reardon, who performed the surgery, told reporters Wednesday. Doctors determined Bush had a perforated ulcer in her duodenum, the first portion of the small intestine after the stomach, he said. In the operating room, doctors thoroughly cleaned her abdominal cavity of any contaminants that had leaked through the hole, described by the hospital as being one centimeter in diameter. Then, doctors repaired the ulcer and sewed a piece of the fat tissue in the abdomen, on top of it to seal it, Reardon said. Bush's husband, former President George H.W. Bush, was with her Thursday morning, but was leaving to attend Thanksgiving dinner with his son Neil, the Methodist Hospital spokeswoman told CNN. The ulcer was biopsied and is benign, Reardon said Wednesday. He suggested it might have been caused by anti-inflammatory medications.

Injured passengers are taken to a hospital after Saturday's accident at Denver International Airport. All 115 people aboard the Continental Airlines jet escaped Saturday evening, and of the dozens who were taken to hospitals, five were still hospitalized Sunday afternoon, said Robert Sumwalt, a National Transportation Safety Board member leading the investigation team. No deaths were reported. Sumwalt said the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were recovered and appeared to be in good condition, though they were covered in soot from the fire. Both recorders were sent to Washington to be reviewed as early as Sunday night. \"We are here for one reason and one reason only, to find out what happened so we can keep it from happening again,\" Sumwalt said. The flight was bound for Houston, Texas, and was taking off about 6:18 p.m. Saturday when it skidded into a ravine and caught fire. Thirty-eight people were taken to hospitals after the accident, airport officials said Sunday. Officials said one of the five people still hospitalized was in serious condition; no one was reported to be in critical condition. Bone fractures and bruises were the most common complaint, and there appeared to be no burn victims, fire officials said. Investigators will interview crew members, review crew training and evaluate several factors, including the weather at the time of the crash and structure of the plane, Sumwalt said. While officials were on the scene Sunday, evidence collection, documentation and measurements will start Monday. \"We are just now beginning our investigation,\" Sumwalt said, adding that short, cold days will be a challenge for the investigators. At a news conference late Saturday, Patrick Hynes, chief of the airport division of the Denver Fire Department, said crews responding to the scene \"had a difficult time narrowing down exactly where the airplane ended up,\" but found it north of a firehouse. When they arrived, firefighters found the Boeing 737 on fire in a ravine about 200 yards from the runway, with its wheels sheared off and fuel tanks leaking, Hynes said. \"They [firefighters] described a surreal scene when they pulled up, heavy fire on the right side of the aircraft, all chutes deployed from both sides of the aircraft, people evacuating and walking up the hillside towards them,\" he said. Hynes said the entire right side of the jet was in flames and \"a heck of a firefight\" followed.  Watch airport official describe scene of accident \u00bb . \"There was significant extension of fire into the cabin portion,\" he said. \"There's significant fire damage inside with the luggage compartment described as melting and dropping down into the seats.\" Hynes said fuel from the aircraft leaked for several hours after the accident. Continental issued a statement saying it was collecting information about the accident. The 115 people on board included five crew members. The airport originally said 112 people were on board, but raised that to 115 on Sunday, saying officials had not counted some children who were not ticketed. Planes resumed takeoffs and landings at the airport after the incident, although Day said a section of the airport will remain closed into Sunday. She suggested passengers call ahead for Sunday departure times, because many flights may be delayed. Passenger Gabriel Trejos described a scene of panic as the plane skidded off the runway while trying to take off. \"Some people were trying to get luggage from the top, [and] the engine was on fire, so I was worried about getting out of there,\" Trejos said Sunday. \"And then we had another guy yelling, 'Oh, the plane's going to blow up!

The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom issued a report citing \"threats and intimidation\" against Chaldo-Assyrians and other Christians, Sabean-Mandaeans and Yazidis. The commission wants the U.S. State Department to designate Iraq as a \"country of particular concern\" -- a status that would allow policy responses, including public condemnations, the denial of state visits, and even sanctions. Spokeswoman Judith Ingram said such a designation would draw attention to the abuses and \"encourage a robust policy response.\" There has been \"reconciliation\" between Iraq's dominant Shiite and Sunni religious groups, but tensions continue to reverberate and that's a concern, the commission said. But the smaller groups don't have \"militia or tribal structures to protect them\" and they \"do not receive adequate official protection.\" \"Iraq's non-Muslim religious minorities -- particularly Christians, Mandaeans and Yazidis -- have suffered religiously-based attacks and other abuses, and have fled the country, at rates far disproportionate to their numbers, seriously threatening these communities' continued existence in Iraq,\" the report said. \"Lacking militias, and in the case of the Mandaeans unable to defend themselves for religious reasons, they are easy prey for extremists and criminals, and they do not receive adequate protection from the authorities.

Swedish truck and bus maker Scania is to reopen a former plant in Iraq. The company, Scania, issued a statement on its Web site confirming the deal to produce 500 trucks ordered by Iraq, with work starting during the third quarter of 2009. The work will be performed in the same Iskandariya factory south of Baghdad where the company's previous operation was housed.

Bilal Abdulla is shown being arrested after the attack at Glasgow Airport. Bilal Abdulla was well-educated and working as a doctor when he carried out his plot to plant car bombs in London -- rather than unemployed or with feelings of being outside or abandoned by society as has been seen before in the UK. Born in southern England, his family moved to Iraq when he was a child. He grew up in the capital during Saddam Hussein's rule and went to the University of Baghdad before returning to Britain to attend Cambridge University. The Cambridge-educated graduate became a doctor working in the National Health Service where the maxim is to treat anyone regardless of the ability to pay. Deputy Assistant Commissioner John McDowall, who heads the Counter Terrorism Command, said Abdulla and Kafeel Ahmed -- who died from burn injuries after he crashed a jeep into Glasgow International Airport, Scotland -- reveal a new type of terrorist. He told the UK's Press Association: \"These individuals were not on our radar and that in itself is very interesting. When you look at the profile of these individuals they are very different from the terrorists we have dealt with in this country before - being professional people. McDowell added they were probably inspired by al Qaeda in Iraq but developed their plan in Britain without help from abroad. \"I think this was a group that was largely self-motivated, came up with the ideas themselves, tutored themselves through the Internet. I don't think they received significant training elsewhere, which is unusual from what we have had in the past,\" he told PA. Abdulla's motive, prosecutors said, was revenge for the bloodshed in Iraq. Prosecutor Jonathan Laidlaw said: 'There is no longer a conventional approach to terrorism. There are no rules to be broken any more, nothing can be taken for granted.\" Abdulla was found guilty Tuesday of conspiracy to murder and conspiring to cause explosions.

But his association with the game and humanitarian work has also helped transform the lives of many others. Jayasuriya's stature and shot-making led to comparisons with India's Sachin Tendulkar. \"Without cricket I would have a small job in my home town. My mother is happy to say my name,\" he told CNN in Hong Kong. His mother's pride in his success has an extra poignancy as Jayasuriya's fame in some part helped his mother survive the south Asian tsunami on December 26, 2004. She was swept away by the first wave and only by calling out to get attention, saying she was Jayasuriya's mother, did a rescuer manage to spot her among the debris and destruction and pull her to safety. Thousands of others, including many of Jayasuriya's friends and neighbors, were not so fortunate, and the impact that the disaster had on Jayasuriya's hometown of Matara and many other parts of Sri Lanka is still felt today. \"Even now when many people hear the word (tsunami), they are still scared. When my mother hears it, she still can't run,\" he said. After nearly 20 years of international cricket, the 39-year-old is now just as happy to put bowling attacks to the sword as well as working as a UN Goodwill Ambassador. \"Coming from Sri Lanka you need to do a lot of charity work and help in anyway you can. People love cricket and they look to cricketers, so as a team Sri Lanka also does a lot for charity. It's a personal commitment,\" he told CNN. On the pitch he has always been just as committed to helping his team. Making his international Test match debut in 1991, he captained the Sri Lankan team for four years until 2003 and hit memorable centuries against every other Test side, bar the West Indies and New Zealand. He retired from the five-day version of the game in 2007. However it was in the one day game that the all-rounder has really made his mark. As part of the Sri Lankan team that won the World Cup in 1996, he played an explosive innings of aggressive shot-making that has been credited with revolutionizing the way in which batsman play the game. In 2005 he became only the fourth batsman to reach 10,000 runs in one-day matches and his current stats stand at 12785 runs from 421 one-day internationals. Having made his name in the 50-over version of the game he's still involved in cricket's latest revolution; the even shorter Twenty20 game that is being touted as the future of popularizing the sport. \"Cricket has changed all over the world. For the public to watch this game we need for it to change. You can now enjoy all that in around 3 hours (with Twenty20). The Indian Premier League (IPL) is good for cricket and good for cricketers. The one-day game will be phased down.\" Throughout his career he's shown his own resilience adapting to changing circumstances on the cricket pitch as well as off it. Before the 2003 World Cup he took the decision not to sign a contract with the Sri Lankan cricket board, citing the loss of potential earnings it would mean for him and fellow players. Despite not being a confrontational personality, the tension between himself and the Sri Lankan cricket board led to his resignation from the captaincy in 2003. With no Test cricket to play this year, Jayasuriya found himself omitted from the Sri Lanka squad for 2008 series one-day series against the West Indies. However his fine form while playing in the IPL -- he ended its inaugural season as the third highest run scorer with 514 runs and hitting 31 sixes -- convinced the selectors to pick him for the upcoming one-day series between Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. \"Looking back I could never have thought I would have come this far. Buddhism helped me a lot. It says that you should take the middle path and you will never go wrong,\" he said. \"But I've done a lot of hard work and everyone, my family and coaches, have given me support. Without that I wouldn't have got here.\" When he does finally retire you can expect Jayasuriya to keep giving all he can to the game and causes he loves so much.", "6b24f125bd26c8a8826c210f5c1748c9a78aa202": "HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- \"Che\" the movie met Che the myth in Cuba this weekend, and the lengthy biopic of the Argentinean revolutionary won acclaim from among those who know his story best. Actor Benicio Del Toro stars in \"Che,\" which details Che Guevara's role in the 1950s Cuban revolution. The movie was screened Saturday in the Yara movie theater in central Havana as part of the 30th International Festival of the New Latin American Cinema. \"Che\" also played Sunday at Havana's Karl Marx Theater. \"Che\" stars Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro in the title role, for which he won a best actor award at this year's Cannes Film Festival. But it's one thing to make a movie about Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara and the Cuban revolution and show it in France, quite another to screen it in Cuba. Speaking to CNN outside the Karl Marx Theater, the bilingual Puerto Rican actor admitted some anxiety. \"This is Cuban history, so there's an audience in there that probably, that could be the biggest critics and the most knowledgeable critics of the historical accuracy of the film,\" Del Toro said.  Watch Del Toro talk about the movie in Cuba \u00bb . It appears he needn't have worried. Audiences gave the movie hearty ovations. And Granma, the official mouthpiece of the Cuban government, gave Del Toro a glowing review. \"Del Toro personifies Che in a spectacular manner, not only his physical appearance but also his masterly interpretation,\" the state newspaper said. After the showing, Del Toro characterized the public reaction as \"sensational, a shot of adrenaline,\" Granma said. \"The dream was to make this movie and to bring it here, where it all began.\" The movie has two parts: \"El argentino,\" which portrays Guevara's role in the 1950s Cuban revolution, and \"Guerrilla,\" which shows Guevara's efforts in Africa and Bolivia, where he was killed in 1967. It was directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also directed Del Toro in the 2000 film \"Traffic,\" for which Del Toro won an Oscar. At 4 hours and 17 minutes, \"Che\" can test viewers' stamina. But that wasn't a problem in Havana. It's a story Cubans know by heart. But this time, it's told by outsiders. Catalina, a history professor who would give only her first name, was a tough critic. \"The movie is well-done. It has good intentions,\" she said. \"But in my opinion, in the first part, the scenes in the jungle seemed a bit like a caricature.\" Though some debated the details of this story they know so well, most -- like a young Guevara lookalike who identified himself only as Daniel -- were pleased. \"It has captured history to perfection,\" he said. \"It has been well thought out and well-created.\" Others, like student Susel Paraza, were torn about seeing their history told by others. \"What hurt me a little,\" she said, \"is that it wasn't us, the Cubans, who thought to make a movie like this but instead a foreign director with foreign actors who have recreated this story very well.\" Other foreign actors have played Guevara, most notably Egyptian-born Omar Sharif in a 1969 U.S. production titled \"Che!\" Soderbergh's \"Che\" has been shown at six film festivals worldwide and will have a limited opening in the United States on December 12. It is scheduled for widespread U.S. distribution starting January 24. Although many may not know Guevara's history, his image is recognized worldwide from a photograph taken by Alberto Korda at a Havana memorial service in March 1960. Titled \"Guerrillero Heroico\" (Heroic Guerrilla), the image of a somber, long-haired and bearded Guevara wearing a beret with a lone star became what the Maryland Institute College of Art called \"the most famous photograph in the world and a symbol of the 20th century.\" The image has been emblazoned on everything from T-shirts to posters and even tattoos. \"There is no other image like it. What other image has been sustained in this way?\" Trisha Ziff, the curator of an exhibition on the iconography of Guevara, asked in a 2007 interview with the BBC. \"Che Guevara has become a brand. And the brand's logo is the image, which represents change. It has becomes the icon of the outside thinker, at whatever level -- whether it is anti-war, pro-green or anti-globalization.\" Guevara was 31 years old when the photo was taken. He has been dead for 41 years, longer than he was alive. Jonathan Green, former longtime director of the UCR/California Museum of Photography, has been quoted as saying, \"Korda's image has worked its way into languages around the world. It has become an alpha-numeric symbol, a hieroglyph, an instant symbol. It mysteriously reappears whenever there's a conflict.

Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan rest at a giant panda research center in Sichuan province on Monday. Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, both four years old, had been living in Ya'an since the May 12 earthquake that damaged their former home in Wolong in Sichuan, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. The pandas ate a meal of steamed corn buns and carrots before they were placed in a truck and taken to the Sichuan capital of Chengdu. From there, they were flown to Taiwan. \"They had a good breakfast to sustain them on the long journey,\" said a Taiwan keeper traveling with the animals to the island, according to Xinhua.

Regularly scheduled commercial flights, shipping and mail between Taiwan and China resumed last week for the first time since the 1949 revolution that brought the Communist Party to power on the Chinese mainland. On Monday, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said China would provide 130 billion yuan ($19 billion) in financing over the next two to three years to Taiwan-based companies doing business in the mainland. Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou has been cultivating ties with Beijing since winning office in March. Ma, a Nationalist, opposes reunification with China but ran on a platform touting the economic benefits of better relations with the mainland. In June -- in the first formal talks between the two sides in almost a decade --Chinese and Taiwanese officials agreed to set up permanent offices in each other's territories. Taiwan separated from China after the communists' victory in the Chinese civil war in 1949. About 2 million Chinese Nationalists fled to Taiwan and set up a government there. Beijing has always considered the island a part of China and has threatened to go to war should Taiwan declare formal independence. China said in May 2005 it would give the island two giant pandas, but their departure was delayed for more than three years. Improved ties between the two sides made the delivery of the pandas possible, Xinhua reported.

Album sales are falling, P2P file sharing is rife, and a plethora of new artists are using the Internet as a platform for gaining international exposure. With the introduction of MySpace Music, three major record labels -- Sony BMG, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group -- are hoping to launch a counter-strike to the technological developments and online activities that have rocked their industry. But, how far can the record labels go towards getting back those good old days where they were uncontested as they reaped the lion's share of profits from the music industry? Experts CNN spoke to for a Just Imagine article had contrasting views on what the coming years hold for the industry. Long-time music industry figure Bob Lefsetz was critical of the new venture. \"Radio on demand, in one's home, in front of the computer, which is what MySpace actually is, is not a sexy alternative to owning what you want and taking it to the beach, to the party, to your workout,\" he said, comparing it with Apple's iTunes and iPod. Lefsetz feels the record labels have to face serious decline, unless they can come up with a new business model. Well-known music artists' rights advocate, educator and industry commentator, Moses Avalon, was more positive about MySpace Music's hopes and the future of the record label industry. Music industry lecturer Andrew Dubber, meanwhile, believed the future would be characterized by change, and that there is no set model for the future of the recording industry. Now, we want to know what you think. Give us your views on the future of the music industry. Do you have a business model you think the record labels should adopt to build a strong future?

A platoon commander in Vietnam, Konrardy was wounded when shrapnel tore through his body. Four comrades carried him to safety in a poncho for more than an hour while the firefight raged. Bob Konrardy says the fallen soldier monument outside his home honors soldiers killed in Iraq like Dave Behrle. \"These four guys went back to help the platoon because they were still fighting, and all four of those guys got killed,\" Konrardy says. \"I felt guilty for 40-something years.\" Two years ago, Konrardy got to thinking: He'd be a Santa of sorts for soldiers in Iraq as a way to help him deal with his conscience. He would collect autographed college and pro footballs, letters from local kids and other mementoes from home to help inspire the troops in Iraq. Then, he would have the goods delivered to his old platoon serving in Iraq, the First Cavalry Division. He initially thought he'd have the material shipped. But his plan changed when the military signed off for Konrardy to deliver the goods in person and work as an embedded journalist for a local paper. The 65-year-old grandpa was about to head to one of the world's most dangerous places.  Watch \"I could have been killed\" \u00bb . \"I wanted to maybe bury some Vietnam demons and just make a difference with this platoon and maybe make up for what I didn't do with my old platoon,\" he says. \"I thought it was going to go one way. It went the other. It made me worse.\" He adds, \"I couldn't sleep before, but now it's worse. I hate to see it get dark. I get extremely nervous. I get uptight. I just don't like to see it get dark. And once it is dark, I'm on edge until it gets dawn.\" Konrardy's story is one of patriotism, heroism and torment -- a war veteran unable to escape what happened in 1965, when he was just 23. \"Here's a guy who is a true American hero in his own right. He was wounded in action in the Iadrang Valley, and he comes into a combat zone 40 years later,\" says Maj. Chris Rogers, the operations officer of the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, when Konrardy embedded with them. \"In my opinion, he's a guy who has done it all -- bled for his own country -- and he's more interested in telling the story of today's generation of young heroes than trumpeting his own horn.\" Konrardy was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder shortly after he retired from John Deere in 2002, when he says his disorder really kicked in. He once sleep-drove to a Wal-Mart about 20 minutes from his home at 3 a.m. He doesn't recall how he got there or how he got home. He only remembers a guy mopping the floor asking if he could be helped. Other times, he'd patrol the neighborhood in the wee hours of the night with his loaded 9-mm pistol on his hip. His counselor with the Department of Veterans Affairs once asked what he would do if the police ever stopped him. \"I said, 'I'll just shoot out his windows and escape and evade back to the house. I think it'd be fun.' She didn't like that answer,\" he says with a laugh. \"So I'm lucky because that's probably what I would've tried to do.\" Konrardy checked himself into a VA facility in Des Moines, Iowa, to get help for his PTSD. He chuckles more when he recounts trying to escape from the place and police approached him. \"I rolled down a hill and started running so they couldn't catch me. They said that was the wrong thing to do.\"  Learn about PTSD and how to get help \u00bb . He says he was then put in an isolation ward for 11 days and nights, and eventually released. It was August 2005. Fast forward to the fall of 2006. That's when Konrardy spoke to his grandson's eighth-grade class about his war experience. They thanked him for serving his country. \"Nobody had ever done that before, for serving in Vietnam,\" he says. He started e-mailing members of the Army's First Cavalry Division as part of his grandson's \"adopt a platoon\" project. He got autographed footballs from the Green Bay Packers and Indianapolis Colts, as well as from the University of Tennessee and University of Georgia. Even the players at local St. Ambrose University chipped in with a football of their own: the game ball from their championship game. \"I just wanted to do something and make up for what I didn't do for my guys,\" Konrardy says. His family gathered for Christmas that year and he told of his plans to travel to Iraq. \"Everybody cried,\" he says. \"I said, 'Hey, this is a chance of a lifetime. I have to go.' \" Quizzed about why a man who was held in a VA facility a couple years earlier was cleared to travel to Iraq, Konrardy laughs. He says CNN is the first to ask  that question. But he adds the original plan was for him to not go into combat. \"On the way over, I didn't think I'd be going out.\" By March 2007, the old warrior's boots were on the ground in Baghdad. His plan was to hand out the 95 pounds of goods and kick back with the soldiers at base camp, collecting their stories and gathering video to give to their families back home. Konrardy handed the St. Ambrose football to a soldier named David W. Behrle, a 20-year-old from Tipton, Iowa. He scooped it up and cherished it. Konrardy was officially in Iraq as an embedded journalist to file blog posts for \"The Quad-City Times.\" He had not intended to go into combat, but that quickly changed. He says the commander said if he wanted to get to know the troops \"you've gotta be proactive.\" Konrardy says he hopped into a Humvee and began patrolling the tight streets of Baghdad with the unit. He was assigned the back right seat for four days. His Humvee once struck a dud of a roadside bomb that blew the tire out underneath where he was sitting. Gunfire erupted. \"Looking back, I'm thinking, 'Wow, I could have been killed,' \" he says. He's still haunted by another time in Iraq -- not because of what happened, but because of what he didn't do. \"I'm going to the bathroom and I hear somebody crying. My first instinct was to be a grandpa: I'm going to go in and I'm going to hold this young kid whoever it is and just say, 'I know where you're coming from. I've been there. Let's just talk.' \" He adds, \"But I chickened out. I didn't do that. Now, I wish I would have.\" A few weeks after he left Iraq, soldiers he befriended were riding in a Bradley Fighting Vehicle on patrol around Baghdad. He says the soldiers had recently saved a young Iraqi girl who had been shot in the head from insurgent crossfire. But on this day, May 19, 2007, a roadside bomb went off, killing all six soldiers inside. One of those killed was Spc. David Behrle, the soldier who loved the football hand-delivered by Konrardy. \"I took that hard. It still bothers me,\" Konrardy says. Outside his Iowa home, a flagpole stands on Konrardy's lawn. A fallen soldier monument sits at its base with a pair of boots, rifle facing down and helmet with the name \"Behrle\" on it. Behrle's family was so moved by Konrardy they had it built for him. Kneeling next to the monument, Konrardy says, \"It reminds me of Dave. But it also reminds me of the Behrle family and how close we've gotten with them and how great they've been in my grieving for Dave and helping me ... try to readjust to the things I went through in Iraq.\" \"They say I helped them; I say they helped me.\" The lifelong Republican recently did something he thought he'd never do: He says he voted for a Democrat for the president of the United States. Thousands of American troops will soon be returning home in need of help just like him. Konrardy, who is still getting PTSD treatment, wishes the rest of the nation could better understand what that's like. \"I just want them to realize the life of a soldier is not what you think,\" he says. \"It changes you for the rest of your life.\"", "4e91d616a08a8dfb97b65898ef146845cf5468b3": "BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- Concerns were growing Wednesday for a polar bear born last month at a German zoo after its twin died and was possibly eaten by its mother.

The surviving twin was doing well, the zoo said, but added that it was concerned the mother may not be able to care for it properly.

Fareed Zakaria says he doesn't think the crisis between Russia and Georgia is likely to be resolved soon. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has accused the United States of orchestrating the conflict in Georgia to benefit one of its presidential candidates. In an exclusive interview Thursday with CNN's Matthew Chance in the Black Sea city of Sochi, Russia, Putin said the U.S. had encouraged Georgia to attack the autonomous region of South Ossetia. Putin said his defense officials had told him it was done to benefit a presidential candidate, but he presented no evidence to back it up. \"U.S. citizens were indeed in the area in conflict,\" Putin said. \"They were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered, and the only one who can give such orders is their leader.\" White House spokeswoman Dana Perino blasted Putin's statements, saying they were \"patently false.\" Russia is trying to counterbalance mounting pressure from the West over its military action in Georgia and its recognition of the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. But Russia's hopes of winning international support were dashed Thursday when China and other Asian nations expressed concern about tension in the region. The joint declaration from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which includes China, Russia, Tajikistan, Kyrgystan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, said the countries hoped that any further conflict could be resolved peacefully. CNN spoke to world affairs expert and author Fareed Zakaria about the Russia-Georgia situation. CNN: Is the crisis between Russia and Georgia likely to get resolved soon? Zakaria: No, positions are actually hardening. The Russians have formally recognized the two regions of Georgia -- Abkhazia and South Ossetia -- and on our program, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, has demanded the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers, to be replaced by European Union peacekeepers. So the two sides are actually further apart than they were 10 days ago. CNN: Who will prevail? Zakaria: It's difficult to see the circumstances under which Russia will withdraw completely. On the other hand, its recognition of the two provinces is a joke. Almost no country in the world has followed them in this recognition. So they might be willing to reverse themselves on this issue. But I can't see them getting out completely. CNN: So Russia wins? Zakaria: Well, even if it wins in the narrow sense, it will lose in a broader sense. Russia's actions have scared all their neighbors, aroused anti-Russian nationalism, driven the Poles, the Ukrainians and so many other countries closer to the West and away from Moscow. Countries around the world have been startled by the Soviet-era tactics. And what have they gained for all this? South Ossetia. I think this will go down in history as a major strategic blunder. The Russians have massively overplayed their hand. CNN: Why did they do it? Zakaria: They would argue that the West pushed and punished them after the collapse of the Soviet Union and that by expanding NATO to their borders, it signaled that it still saw Russia as a rival and relations as competitive. Perhaps there is some truth to their perception, but there were also much broader developments in Russia over the last decade. The rise of Russian nationalism, an anti-Western and anti-democratic movement, the rise of an elected dictatorship, and above all, the rise in oil wealth, which always produces corruption, dysfunction and arrogance. Russia has moved in anti-modern directions, and much of it has nothing to do with what the West did or didn't do. CNN: What should the United States do? Zakaria: Assist Georgia in rebuilding and securing itself. Assure countries like Poland that may be insecure. But also, don't overreact. Russia's blunder is producing a reaction in the region and across the world. Let that play itself out. We should be firm in insisting that they cannot re-impose their rule in Georgia, but there is little to be gained in a total cutoff with Moscow. We have to deal with Russia on many issues, from Iran to North Korea.

Laura Bush and Cindy McCain speak at a shortened first day of the Republican National Convention Monday. The convention, delayed briefly when  Hurricane Gustav hit the Gulf Coast, is also being held later in the year than any nominating convention in history. Check out these tidbits of convention history and political trivia. Location . The Republican National Convention is being held in the Xcel Energy Center, the home of the National Hockey League team the Minnesota Wild. To prepare the Xcel center for the GOP convention, workers removed 3,000 seats and installed more than 25 miles of cable . Sen. Barack Obama gave his first speech as the Democrats' presumptive 2008 presidential nominee at the Xcel Center on June 3. The Twin Cities and Denver have each received $50 million each in federal funds for convention security. No Republican since Richard Nixon has carried Minnesota in a presidential general election -- the longest Democratic streak of any state in the nation. The Delegates . About 2,300 delegates and 2,200 alternates delegates are expected to journey to the twin cities for the event, and the Minneapolis/St. Paul economy is expected to benefit to the tune of $150 to $160 million. The Candidates, past and present . John McCain turned 72 last week; if elected, he'll be the oldest president sworn in to a first term. Two GOP presidential nominees were older than McCain; Ronald Reagan was 73 in 1984 when he was running for his second term and Bob Dole was 73 in 1996. Dole lost that election to Bill Clinton. John McCain was a prisoner of war in Vietnam from 1967 to 1973; his service awards include the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit and a Purple Heart. McCain's father and grandfather were both U.S. Navy admirals; they were the first father and son to achieve that rank. McCain represented Arizona in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 1987; he has served in the U.S. Senate since 1987. McCain was the presidential nominating speaker in 1996 for Sen. Robert Dole. McCain clinched the Republican presidential nomination on March 4 after winning 26 primary season contests. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is the second woman to serve on a major party ticket -- in 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro was the first woman to serve on a major party ticket. Palin is the first woman to serve as Alaska governor; she was elected in 2006, winning the election to the governorship as a maverick reformer willing to distance herself from the Republican Party. McCain first met Palin at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington in February of 2008. Conventions . National political conventions were covered on radio for the first time in 1924, and covered on television for the first time since 1948. 2008 marks the fourth time the parties have held back-to-back conventions; it also happened in 1912, 1916 and 1956.

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called the Israeli army \"cowards.\" The decision on whether to expel Venezuela's charge d'affaires will be taken later Wednesday, said Yigal Palmor, the spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry. On Tuesday, Venezuela expelled Israel's ambassador to Caracas and accused Israel of attempting to carry out \"genocide\" against the Palestinian people. \"In this tragic and indignant hour, the people of Venezuela manifest their unconditional solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people, share in the sadness that overcomes thousands of families through the loss of their loved ones, and extends to them a hand by affirming that the government of Venezuela will not rest until it sees those responsible for these criminal atrocities severely punished,\" the Venezuelan foreign minister said in a statement read by an anchor on state television. The statement added that the government \"condemns strongly the flagrant violations of international law\" by Israel and \"denounces their planned utilization of state terrorism.\" \"For the above-mentioned reasons, the government of Venezuela has decided to expel the ambassador of Israel and some of the personnel of the Israeli Embassy in Venezuela,\" it added. In a news conference broadcast by state-run Venezuelan television, President Hugo Chavez blasted the Israeli military. \"They are cowards,\" he said. \"It's as though a boxing professional were to come here and challenge you to box. Well, how courageous! How courageous is the Israeli army!\" It said that Chavez \"makes a fraternal call to the Jewish people throughout the world to oppose these criminal policies of the state of Israel that recall the worst pages of the history of the 20th century. \"With the genocide of the Palestinian people, the state of Israel will never be able to offer its people the perspective of a peace that is both necessary and long-lasting.\" Mark Regev, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, was unswayed. \"I haven't heard the details yet, but you know the regime in Venezuela has been one of the few countries in the world that gives automatic support to the Iranian extremists, and it doesn't surprise me that they have affinity with groups like Hamas and Hezbollah,\" he told CNN.

David Puckett's nonprofit has provided free artificial limbs, orthopedic braces and care to more than 420 people. But today, thanks to David Puckett and his U.S.-based nonprofit, Morales has new prosthetic legs. Now, he's not only able to walk, but his newfound independence has made it possible for him to move to another town where he could find work. \"He lifted me up to where I am today,\" Morales says. Morales isn't the only person in southeastern Mexico who credits Puckett with changing his life. Since November 2000, the certified, licensed prosthetist/orthotist from Savannah, Georgia, has been providing artificial limbs, orthopedic braces and ongoing care to hundreds in need in the communities of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and Chiapas -- free of charge. \"When someone loses a limb they immediately know what they've lost,\" says Puckett. \"The goal is to restore the healthy self image again so that that person can see themselves whole.\" Puckett first connected with the Yucatan people while volunteering on a mission there as a teenager. Struck by the overwhelming poverty and the physical challenges he saw people facing in the rural communities, Puckett vowed to return and make a difference there. \"When I finally got into the field of orthotics and prosthetics, I said, 'Ah-ha. Now, I know what I can do.' \" His nonprofit, PIPO Missions: Limbs and Braces to Mexico, collects donated, used orthopedic braces and artificial limbs in the United States and crafts new ones from their recycled components. On average, Puckett makes a six-day trip every two months to distribute the custom prosthetics and braces, while also providing ongoing care. \"To deliver an artificial limb or brace without follow-up doesn't help that person in the long run,\" says Puckett. \"We need to make sure that they have what they need to continue living successfully for years to come.\" Over the course of his 41 trips to the region, Puckett has helped more than 420 individuals. He's found that word of his work spreads fast through the villages and people will drive hours to attend his clinics. Puckett's trips are routinely extended to accommodate house calls to immobile residents of distant towns.

The mixed blessing is they'll bring 50 or 100 people that have physical needs,\" says Puckett. \"The difficulty for me is, how do I say no?\" For Puckett, each trip demonstrates the immeasurable impact he is making on people's lives. Stories of previously unimagined independence, confidence and employment greet him from clinical waiting areas, often along with offerings of food, livestock and friendship. When his group helps one person, Puckett explains, it has an effect on an entire community.  Watch Puckett describe how one patient in Mexico crafted himself a homemade foot \u00bb . \"It opens a whole other door for many of these folks to experience the world in a way in which they've never even dreamt of,\" says Puckett. \"And the world has an opportunity to greet them, accept them and welcome them back into society. So, it's a double blessing.\"  Watch Puckett describe how he helped a woman now known as \"the miracle girl\" \u00bb . In between trips, Puckett also spends time soliciting the aid of surgeons, as he frequently encounters physical conditions that require surgery before prosthetic help can be successfully administered. \"If we had a surgeon here, we could see eight to 10 patients in a weekend and change their lives forever,\" he says. \"It's tough for people to make the choice to give up time with their families and a portion of their income to extend themselves in this way.

Bruce Jeffrey Pardo went on a shooting rampage in a Los Angeles suburb on Wednesday, police say. Prime suspect Bruce Jeffrey Pardo, who police said committed suicide hours after he went on a shooting rampage and started a raging house fire in the Los Angeles suburb of Covina, left a rental car with a gasoline canister outside the home of attorney Scott Nord, said Pat Buchanan of the Covina Police Department. Police previously said that Pardo targeted his rampage at his former wife, Sylvia Ortega Pardo, and her family at the family's Christmas Eve party. A divorce between the two was finalized in court on December 18 in a \"somewhat contentious proceeding,\" Covina Police Chief Kim Raney said last week. Police believe Pardo planned to carry out a similar attack at Nord's house as he did at the shooting and house fire that claimed nine lives. Another rented car that Pardo used to flee the scene was found booby-trapped after the shooting, police said. That car burned as the Covina bomb squad was trying to disconnect an explosive device in it, police said. On Saturday, Covina police released the names of the nine people unaccounted for since the shooting and fire. Nine bodies were recovered from the rubble of the house, but authorities said that they are having to work with dental records to establish identities. \"The bodies were so badly burned they cannot be identified any other way,\" said Covina police Lt. Pat Buchanan. The nine unaccounted for include Sylvia Pardo, her parents, her sister, her two brothers, both brothers' wives, and a nephew. Ages of the nine range from 17 to 80, police said. On Monday night, police said Pardo's mother had also planned to attend the Christmas party, but didn't go because she was sick. Pardo had a contentious relationship with his mother, according to Buchanan, because she attended the couple's divorce hearing and had sided with Pardo's ex-wife. The shooting and fire left 10 children orphaned and three others lost one parent.

From the day of his commissioning, John McCain was a respected Naval officer who made decisions on which the lives of others depended. As an elected public servant, he earned the respect of colleagues in both parties as a man to follow when there is a tough call to make. John McCain's life is a story of service above self. Forty years ago in an enemy prison camp, Lt.  Cmdr. McCain was offered release ahead of others who had been held longer. His wounds were so severe that anyone would have understood if he had accepted. John refused. For that selfless decision, he suffered nearly five more years of beatings and isolation. When he was finally released, his arms had been broken, but not his honor. Fellow citizens: If the Hanoi Hilton could not break John McCain's resolve to do what is best for his country, you can be sure the angry left never will. As the father of seven sons and daughters, John has the heart of a protector. He and his wonderful wife, Cindy, are adoptive parents. John is a leader who knows that human life is fragile ... that human life is precious ... that human life must be defended. We have seen John McCain's commitment to principle in our nation's capital. John is a steadfast opponent of wasteful spending. As president, he will stand up to the high-tax crowd in Congress and make the tax relief permanent. He will invest in the energy technologies of tomorrow and lift the ban on drilling for America's offshore oil today. John is an independent man who thinks for himself. He's not afraid to tell you when he disagrees. ... No matter what the issue, this man is honest and speaks straight from the heart. Last year, John McCain's independence and character helped change history. The Democrats had taken control of Congress and were threatening to cut off funds for our troops. In the face of calls for retreat, I ordered a surge of forces into Iraq. Many in Congress said it had no chance of working. Yet one senator above all had faith in our troops and the importance of their mission, and that was John McCain. Some told him that his early and consistent call for more troops would put his presidential campaign at risk. He told them he would rather lose an election than see his country lose a war. That is the kind of courage and vision we need in our next commander in chief. My fellow citizens, we live in a dangerous world. And we need a president who understands the lessons of September 11, 2001: that to protect America, we must stay on the offense, stop attacks before they happen, and not wait to be hit again. The man we need is John McCain. When he takes office next January, John will have an outstanding leader at his side. America will have a strong and principled vice president in the governor of the great state of Alaska, Sarah Palin. In the time the Oval Office has been in my trust, I have kept near my desk reminders of America's character -- including a painting of a West Texas mountain lit by the morning sun. It reminds me that Americans have always lived on the sunrise side of the mountain. We are a nation that looks to the new day with confidence and optimism. I am optimistic about our future, because I believe in the goodness and wisdom of the American people. I am optimistic because I have faith in freedom's power to lift up all of God's children and lead this world to a future of peace. And I am optimistic about something else: When the debates have ended, and all the ads have run, and it is time to vote, Americans will look closely at the judgment, the experience, and the policies of the candidates, and they will cast their ballots for the McCain-Palin ticket. While I am not with you in the Twin Cities on this wonderful night for our party, with Laura Bush speaking, you have clearly traded up. I am so proud the American people have come to know her gracious presence, her determined spirit, and her loving heart. Laura has been a fantastic first lady. Thank you, Laura, and thanks to all of you in the hall tonight. God bless you, and God bless America.", "4928ccf044e057744c301e4b4c1c278ac0109523": "(CNN) -- Venezuela expelled Israel's ambassador to the country Tuesday and accused Israel of attempting to carry out \"genocide\" against the Palestinian people. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called the Israeli army \"cowards.\" \"In this tragic and indignant hour, the people of Venezuela manifest their unconditional solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people, share in the sadness that overcomes thousands of families through the loss of their loved ones, and extends to them a hand by affirming that the government of Venezuela will not rest until it sees those responsible for these criminal atrocities severely punished,\" the Venezuelan foreign minister said in a statement read by an anchor on state television. The statement added that the government \"condemns strongly the flagrant violations of international law\" by Israel and \"denounces their planned utilization of state terrorism.\" \"For the above-mentioned reasons, the government of Venezuela has decided to expel the ambassador of Israel and some of the personnel of the Israeli Embassy in Venezuela,\" it added. In a news conference broadcast by state-run Venezuelan television, President Hugo Chavez blasted the Israeli military. \"They are cowards,\" he said. \"It's as though a boxing professional were to come here and challenge you to box. Well, how courageous! How courageous is the Israeli army!\" It said that Chavez \"makes a fraternal call to the Jewish people throughout the world to oppose these criminal policies of the state of Israel that recall the worst pages of the history of the 20th century. \"With the genocide of the Palestinian people, the state of Israel will never be able to offer its people the perspective of a peace that is both necessary and long-lasting.\" Mark Regev, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, was unswayed. \"I haven't heard the details yet, but you know the regime in Venezuela has been one of the few countries in the world that gives automatic support to the Iranian extremists, and it doesn't surprise me that they have affinity with groups like Hamas and Hezbollah,\" he told CNN.

This enormous raw emerald was being kept in a Las Vegas, Nevada, warehouse. The \"Bahia Emerald\" -- one of the largest ever found -- was reported stolen in September from a secured vault in South El Monte in Los Angeles County.  The report was made by someone who claimed to own the giant gemstone, Los Angeles Sheriff's Lt. Thomas Grubb said. Federal court papers showed the emerald has been at the center of a dispute between a California man who claimed ownership, a company he contracted with to sell it, and a potential buyer. Detective work traced the Brazilian stone to a Las Vegas, Nevada, warehouse, where the person in possession claimed to be the rightful owner, Grubb said. A federal judge ordered the sheriff to hold the 180,000-carat emerald until he can sort the case out, Grubb said. Investigators suspect someone used falsified papers to remove the stone from the secured vault in California, although no criminal charges have been filed, Grubb said. While Grubb said it was his understanding the stone had been appraised at $370 million, the value is unclear. The company hired by the owner to sell it said in court papers it had received a $19 million offer, which the company wanted to accept. It alleged the gemstone's owner then tried to go around the broker to sell the emerald to the same buyer for $75 million. At one point, the emerald was listed for sale on eBay for a \"buy it now\" price of $75 million.", "b0c97a4e917d1d78113ef144bdae41e99db2c328": "MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- A NASA report on the last minutes of Space Shuttle Columbia cited problems with the crew's helmets, spacesuits and restraints, which resulted in \"lethal trauma\" to the seven astronauts aboard. Columbia crew members were killed when the shuttle broke apart upon re-entering Earth's atmosphere. But the report also acknowledged that \"the breakup of the crew module ... was not survivable by any currently existing capability.\" The spacecraft broke up while re-entering Earth's atmosphere near the end of its mission on February 1, 2003. The NASA report found the astronauts knew for about 40 seconds that they did not have control of the shuttle before they likely were knocked unconscious as Columbia broke apart around them.  Watch more details from the report \u00bb . The report also found that while crew members were wearing their pressurized suits, one astronaut did not have on a helmet, three were not wearing gloves and none lowered the visors before the module lost cabin pressure. One astronaut also was not seated. \"In this accident, none of those actions would have ultimately made any difference,\" said former shuttle program manager Wayne Hale, now a deputy NASA administrator. The graphic, 400-page investigative report relied on video, recovered debris and medical findings, supplemented with computer modeling and analyses. It also includes many recommendations to make space travel safer for future astronauts. A shuttle-program source told CNN the families of the astronauts who died were brought in specifically to look at the report and even in some cases to help with its preparation. The report took more than five years to complete. \"The members of this team have done an outstanding job under difficult and personal circumstances,\" said Johnson Space Center director Michael L. Coats. \"Their work will ensure that the legacy of Columbia and her heroic crew continues to be the improved safety of future human spaceflights worldwide.\" Columbia broke apart some 200,000 feet over Texas -- just minutes before it was to have touched down in Florida. The shuttle's wing was damaged on takeoff when a large piece of heat-reflecting foam ripped off and gouged a hole in it. During re-entry, the hole allowed atmospheric gases to burn the wing and destroy the spacecraft. The oldest orbiter in the fleet, Columbia had just completed a 16-day science mission.  Watch the view from the command deck as the shuttle enters the atmosphere \u00bb . Killed were commander Rick Husband, pilot Willie McCool, payload commander Michael Anderson and mission specialists David Brown, Kalpana Chawla, Laurel Clark and Ilan Ramon, an Israeli Air Force colonel who was Israel's first astronaut. By request of the families of the Columbia astronauts, NASA released the report between Christmas and New Year's so that the astronauts' children would be at home where they could discuss the findings with their families in private, said former shuttle commander Pam Melroy, deputy project manager for the investigation team. \"It was a way for us to work through our grief about the accident,\" said Melroy about compiling the report. \"This was one of the hardest things I've ever done.\" The report stated that \"after the crew lost consciousness due to the loss of cabin pressure, the seat inertial reel mechanisms on the crews' shoulder harnesses did not lock. \"As a result, the unconscious or deceased crew was exposed to cyclical rotational motion while restrained only at the lower body. Crew helmets do not conform to the head. Consequently, lethal trauma occurred to the unconscious or deceased crew due to the lack of upper body support and restraint.\" Another section of the report focused on the pressure suits used by the space shuttle crew on launch and re-entry. It said the suits were not part of the initial design of the orbiter and that depressurization \"occurred so rapidly that the crew members were incapacitated within seconds, before they could configure the suit for full protection from loss of cabin pressure.\" Melroy said investigators took some comfort in data that suggests the Columbia crew died abruptly and without suffering. \"Of course, we were relieved,\" she told reporters during a NASA conference call Tuesday afternoon. \"It is a very small blessing, but we'll take them where we can find them.\" The NASA team's report evaluated every aspect of the crew cabin infrastructure, including the design of the safety belts and helmets worn by the crew. The report also included recommendations to improve spacecraft design and crew safety. Those recommendations cover a broad range of subjects from crew training, procedures, restraints and individual safety equipment to spacecraft design methods and recommendations regarding future accident investigations. \"By learning these lessons and ensuring that we continue the journey begun by the crews of Apollo 1, Challenger, and Columbia, we help to give meaning to their sacrifice and the sacrifice of their families,\" the report stated. \"It is for them, and for the future generations of explorers, that we strive to be better and go farther. The report will have little if no effect on the nine remaining space shuttle flights to come. NASA is mothballing the shuttle program in 2010 as it begins a new program, Constellation, designed to send astronauts back to the moon. There is expected to be about a five-year hiatus in manned U.S. space flight as NASA transitions to the new program, which it hopes will launch in 2015.

Two-thirds of people polled think Present-elect Barack Obama's stimulus package will help the economy. Fifty-six percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday said they favor the stimulus package that President-elect Barack Obama is proposing; 42 percent were opposed. Obama is pushing Congress to pass the plan soon after he's inaugurated on January 20, to help jump-start an economy mired in a deep recession. The poll also indicates that two-thirds of the public thinks the stimulus package will do just that, with 17 percent saying it will help the economy a lot and another 50 percent feeling that it will help the economy somewhat. Twenty-one percent say the stimulus package won't help the economy very much and 10 percent say it won't help at all. But Americans seem to be split on whether they'd like more government regulation of business and industry, with 39 percent saying there's too much government regulation and an equal amount saying too little. Twenty percent said the amount of government involvement is just right.  Watch why most Americans back the bailout \u00bb . \"Attitudes toward government have not changed since 2006, when the economy was still in pretty good shape,\" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \"Most still say the government is doing too much that should be left to individuals and businesses, and trust in government is still low.\" On the other hand, he said, \"with the economy in such poor shape, government action to stimulate the economy seems to get an exemption to the general concerns about big government.\" There also appears to be a divide between the parties when it comes to government involvement. \"Six in 10 Democrats want to see the federal government do more,\" Holland said. \"But three-quarters of Republicans would like to see a smaller government. The tiebreaker is independents. A majority of the independents polled say that government is doing too much that should be left to individuals and businesses.\" The poll also suggests that a declining number of Americans trust the government to do what's right. iReport.com: What should Obama do first? Twenty-two percent of those polled said they trust the government to do what's right most of the time. That's down 6 points from when the question was asked two years ago. Sixty-six percent said they trust the government some of the time, and 9 percent said they never trust Washington. On the opposite end of the spectrum, 3 percent said they can always trust the government to do the right thing.

Laborers work on a construction site in a fishing village in Indonesia's Aceh on December 21. Hundreds of thousands were left homeless and jobless after the tsunami, and poor and isolated communities were left even worse off. Today, new schools have been constructed, and armies of workers -- many of them volunteers -- have cleared and rebuilt homes and towns, and helped get people back to work. \"The tsunami, despite being a horrific event, also provided a lot of opportunities for those countries,\" said Jonathan Cauldwell, chief of UNICEF's Tsunami Transition Support. \"It brought a peace dividend within Banda Aceh (Indonesia) where you still see peace in an area which had long term localized conflict in place. It allowed those areas to be built up as well, to have investments in the infrastructure in the social sectors ...,\" he added. Agencies such as UNICEF said that while the immediate emergency was over, they remain committed to improving the lives of millions of children across the region. \"The lessons of the tsunami will never end. The funding will end, we can complete the construction, we can complete the project, but the intervention never ends ...,\" Cauldwell said. Oxfam International, which said it will close its response to the tsunami at the end of December, said it has provided housing to tsunami survivors in Aceh, helped restore the livelihoods of people in India and Sri Lanka, and funded the reconstruction of eight tsunami-affected secondary schools. \"The money we received allowed us not only to help meet the immediate emergency needs of tsunami-affected populations, but also to try to address the factors that made them vulnerable: not least poverty and a lack of influence over their own lives,\" Barbara Stocking, chair of the Oxfam International Tsunami Fund Board, said in a statement. \"What has been achieved is astounding. Hundreds of thousands of people are now living in better conditions than they were in before the tsunami ...,\" she added. UNICEF said the basic needs of children affected by the tsunami have been met -- more children are going to school as a result of improved facilities, and better nutrition, post-natal care and other life-saving interventions are helping those countries worst hit transition to developing regular services and programs. But long-term improvement of water and sanitation is critical, the agency said, and so is building new schools that are better able to withstand earthquakes. According to UNICEF and Oxfam, the response to the tsunami and the lessons learned have changed the way they deal with such emergencies. It highlighted the need for better coordination among partners and other organizations, and contributed to reforms in the way humanitarian relief is delivered.", "d2e96584b92ac662f67b605cc2505456d93f446d": "(CNN) -- Cyclist Chris Hoy has been knighted in the United Kingdom New Year Honors list, while every British gold medallist from the Beijing Olympic Games has also been rewarded.

A gas-compressor and gas-holder station in Mryn, Ukraine. Gazprom said it had cut supplies to Ukraine Thursday. Gazprom had been threatening the move, saying months of negotiations with Ukraine had failed to resolve the issue of outstanding payments. The company says Ukraine owes about $2 billion for past natural gas deliveries. Ukraine also disputes the new price set by Gazprom for 2009 deliveries, which was initially more than double the price from 2008. Gazprom has reassured the rest of Europe that its natural gas supply, which runs through Ukraine, will not be affected by the dispute with Kiev. Thursday, a Gazprom spokesman said on Russian state television the company had actually increased the deliveries to the rest of the continent. \"Gazprom will continue supplying gas for its consumers in Europe at full volume,\" the company's chief executive, Alexey Miller, said. \"We have an effective transit contract.\" Without natural gas, some Ukrainians could be in for chilly days and nights. The temperature at midday Thursday in Kiev was 25 degrees Fahrenheit (-4 degrees Celsius), with a forecast high of only 32 F (0 C) and snow predicted overnight.  Watch a report on Gazprom's threats to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine \u00bb . Ukraine's state-controlled energy company, Naftogaz Ukrainy, said Thursday it is ensuring domestic natural gas needs are covered by taking gas from underground storage facilities. \"All of Ukraine's consumers are fully secured,\" the company said in a statement. In Washington, the White House urged a resolution Thursday. \"The United States would like to see a restoration of normal deliveries,\" White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said. \"The parties should be resolving their differences through good-faith negotiations, without supply cutoffs.\" The frigid weather is of particular concern, the White House said. \"We urge both sides to keep in mind the humanitarian implications of any interruption of gas supply in the winter,\" Johndroe said. Naftogaz Ukrainy also disputed Gazprom's claim that it owes for past deliveries, saying Thursday it has paid its debt to Gazprom in full, though it declined to give a figure. Another part of the dispute centers on Gazprom's price hike for 2009 gas deliveries. Gazprom had wanted to more than double Ukraine's payments, but Wednesday it offered a lower price. Ukraine, which currently pays about $100 per 1,000 cubic meters, balked at the figure offered, saying it simply can't afford to pay the new price. It is the second time in three years Gazprom has threatened to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine. The company made good on its threat on January 1, 2006, but turned the supply back on a day later. Russia is the world's biggest producer of natural gas and supplies Europe with more than 40 percent of its imports -- mainly via the pipelines through Ukraine. Naftogaz said in its statement Thursday that it would ensure the uninterrupted flow of Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine, but only under existing arrangements. It indicated some gas deliveries to Europe could be halted in Ukraine if Naftogaz fails to reach a new agreement with Gazprom. Although gas is still flowing to Europe, there are also concerns in Russia that the amount could be reduced if Ukraine siphons off some of the gas headed to the west. Naftogaz said it will continue negotiating with Gazprom to address the issues.", "69edff3a8e78207d641d6ba3a7deaa684f867b7c": "(CNN)  -- An Israeli patrol boat struck a boat carrying medical volunteers and supplies to Gaza early Tuesday as it attempted to intercept the vessel in the Mediterranean Sea, witnesses and Israeli officials said. The Dignity arrives in Tyre, Lebanon, after it was reportedly rammed by an Israeli military vessel Tuesday. CNN correspondent Karl Penhaul was aboard the 60-foot pleasure boat Dignity when the contact occurred. When the boat later docked in the Lebanese port city of Tyre, severe damage was visible to the forward port side of the boat, and the front left window and part of the roof had collapsed. It was flying the flag of Gibraltar. The Dignity was carrying crew and 16 passengers -- physicians from Britain, Germany and Cyprus and human rights activists from the Free Gaza Solidarity Movement  -- who were trying to reach Gaza through an Israeli blockade of the territory. Also on board was former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney. Penhaul said an Israeli patrol boat shined its spotlight on the Dignity, and then it and another patrol boat shadowed the Dignity for about a half hour before the collision. One patrol boat \"very severely rammed\" the Dignity, Penhaul said. The captain of the Dignity told Penhaul he received no warning. Only after the collision did the Israelis come on the radio to say they struck the boat because they believed it was involved in terrorist activities, the captain said. But Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor denied that and said the patrol boat had warned the vessel not to proceed to Gaza because it is a closed military area. Palmor said there was no response to the radio message, and the vessel then tried to out-maneuver the Israeli patrol boat, leading to the collision.  Watch Penhaul describe the boat damage \u00bb . The captain and crew said their vessel was struck intentionally, Penhaul said, but Palmor called those allegations \"absurd.\" \"There is no intention on the part of the Israeli navy to ram anybody,\" Palmor said. \"I would call it ramming. Let's just call it as it is,\" McKinney said after the boat docked in Lebanon. \"Our boat was rammed three times, twice in the front and one on the side.  Watch Cynthia McKinney discuss the collision \u00bb . \"Our mission was a peaceful mission to deliver medical supplies and our mission was thwarted by the Israelis -- the aggressiveness of the Israeli military,\" she said. The incident occurred in international waters about 90 miles off Gaza. Israel controls the waters off Gaza's coast and routinely blocks ships from coming into the Palestinian territory as part of an ongoing blockade that also applies to the Israel-Gaza border. Human rights groups have expressed concern about the blockade on Gaza, which has restricted the delivery of emergency aid and fuel supplies. Tuesday's collision was so severe, Penhaul said, that the passengers were ordered to put on their life vests and be ready to get in lifeboats. The Dignity began taking on water, but the crew managed to pump it out of the hull long enough for the boat to reach shore. \"It could have ended with people drowning if they hit us more square on,\" Dignity's captain, Denis Healey, said. \"It could have gone down in minutes.\" Palmor said the vessel refused assistance after the incident. The boat was carrying boxes of relief supplies, volunteers and journalists to Gaza, the Palestinian territory that has been subject to an intense Israeli bombing campaign since Saturday. Israel Tuesday lambasted McKinney -- the Green Party's 2008 candidate for the U.S. presidency and a former Democratic congresswoman from Georgia -- for taking part in the maritime mission. In a written statement, the Consulate General of Israel to the Southeast, based in Atlanta, Georgia, said McKinney \"has taken it upon herself to commit an act of provocation,\" endangering herself and the crew. \"We regret that during this time of crisis, while Israel is battling with the terrorist organization of Hamas and defending its citizens, that we are forced to deal with Ms. McKinney's irresponsible behavior,\" the statement read. The trip was the Free Gaza Solidarity Movement's sixth in as many months. Israel launched airstrikes against Gaza on Saturday in what Defense Minister Ehud Barak called an \"all-out war\" against the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has ruled the territory since 2007. The Israeli military says its goal is to stop a recent barrage of rocket fire from Gaza into southern Israel.  Watch the chaos in Gaza and Israel \u00bb .

Cristiano Ronaldo shows emotion after being named the FIFA World Player of the Year for 2008. Especially the ones in England. In the days leading up to the awards ceremony, there were various rumors circulating that the Manchester United star was going to be pipped by Leo Messi on Tuesday night. I was asked several times in London whether I really thought Ronaldo was going to win. Whether he really deserved it. It was as if many in the British press didn't want him to take home another award. Do you think Cristiano Ronaldo is shown enough respect? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. The fierce attack on his lifestyle by the tabloids after he crashed his Ferrari last week just accentuated the fact that in the UK, he still has earned little respect. Never mind that he was about to become the first Premier League Player to win this prestigious award. Never mind he has been the competition's biggest ambassador and promoter overseas. Too many in the English media, he was still a diver on the field, and a petulant rock star off it. Now I am not going to sit here and say that my compatriot Cristiano is perfect. He isn't and he makes mistakes. But the same can be said about Wayne Rooney or any of the other English internationals. When Rooney charges down the referee and shouts obscenities in his face without even being booked, as was the case in last weekend's match against Chelsea, is he called arrogant or petulant? No. When he goes seven or eight matches without a goal, is he suddenly branded overrated? No. So all I am asking for here is a little respect. If Ronaldo was English, I am sure in the eyes of the British press he would be virtually untouchable, but although he's not, just give him a break. After all, he had an incredible 2007/2008 season which saw him score 42 goals in 49 matches and win virtually every major trophy on offer. And he's a great ambassador for the game.

South African captain Graeme Smith led from the front with 75 as his team wrapped up victory. Captain Graeme Smith hit a fluent 75 as his side successfully passed a modest victory target of 183 on the final day at the MCG to take an unassailable 2-0 lead. It was the South African's first-ever Test series triumph in Australia and victory in the third and final match in Sydney will see them leapfrog the home side at the top of the global rankings. Hashim Amla (30 not out) scored the winning runs shortly after lunch as South Africa became the first team to overcome Australia at home since the West Indies in 1992-93. South Africa were never under any pressure in their run chase and did not lose a wicket until just before lunch when the inspirational Smith was trapped leg before wicket by Nathan Hauritz. Smith had dominated a 121-run opening stand with Neil McKenzie, hitting 10 boundaries. McKenzie struggled to a half century and survived strong lbw shouts from Brett Lee, who was bowling despite an injured foot that will keep him out of the Sydney Test. South Africa's victory was set up by a brilliant maiden Test century from JP Duminy, who shared a stunning 180-run ninth wicket partnership with pace bowler Dale Steyn. It gave the tourists a priceless 65-run lead on first innings before man of the match Steyn worked his magic with the ball as Australia were bowled out on the fourth day for 247 in their second innings. The pugnacious Smith was virtually lost for words in his victory speech. \"It has been such a special moment for all of us, it has been an incredible team effort,\" he said. \"I have been smiling non-stop since we hit the winning runs. \"To be 2-0 up after this game was something we only dreamt of.\" South Africa won the first Test in Perth from an unlikely position, chasing 414 for victory for the loss of only four wickets.", "2a3a35e8f66a570abaa94c5876140a93de17d52f": "(CNN) -- Anyone who doubts Roland Burris' qualifications to serve as the next senator from Illinois may want to head to Chicago's Oak Woods Cemetery.

Under the seal of the state of Illinois and the words \"Trail Blazer,\" Burris, 71, has listed his many firsts in granite, including being the state's first African-American attorney general and the state's first African-American comptroller.

Tevez has been advised by Argentine coach Maradona to leave Old Trafford at the end of the season. Maradona watched United trounce Chelsea 3-0 last weekend at Old Trafford where striker Tevez remained on the bench despite a rousing reception when he went on a touchline warm-up during the game. \"I saw the Manchester United match. They won, but did so without Tevez. This situation is not good for him. For sure, certain things are happening which mean his departure is nearing,\" Maradona told Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport. \"Italy, and Inter (Milan) in particular, would be great for him. Among other things, the fact that his contract is soon to expire facilitates a change of shirt.\" Weekend reports claimed that United manager Alex Ferguson has already pinpointed Lyon's French international striker Karim Benzema as his chief summer target. Benzema, whose contract runs until 2013, made his mark against United in a Champions League tie last season when he scored in a first leg tie. He hit the target 20 times as Lyon secured a seventh straining French League title and he has netted five times in this season's Champions League. Lyon are said to be willing to cash in at the right price with Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid also monitoring the situation. Media reports said Lyon would want around \u00a340 million (45 million euros) for Benzema  while the asking price for Tevez -- he joined United on a two-year loan -- is likely to be around \u00a332 million. Tevez, who hit the headlines during two seasons in Brazil with Corinthians, has struggled to retain a starting place at Old Trafford following his controversial stay at West Ham. He has indicated he would respond positively to any approach from Real Madrid, but is sure to take on board the advice of Maradona who twice led Napoli to the Serie A title after joining the Italian club from Barcelona. Meanwhile, West Ham face a fresh inquiry after the FA and Premier League launched an investigation relating to dealings with Tevez's representatives after the club had initially been fined \u00a35.5m for breaching league rules over third-party agreements. It follows the findings of an arbitration tribunal in favour of Sheffield United and against West Ham last year which decided Tevez should not have been able to play for the Hammers at the end of the 2006-07 season.

His most recent book is \"The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader.\" Peter Bergen says it's crucial to correctly frame the nature of a war before beginning it. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama and his foreign policy advisers and speechwriters are wrestling with one of the most important speeches of his presidency, his inaugural address. One of their toughest conceptual challenges is how to describe and recast what the Bush administration has consistently termed the \"war on terror.\" The dean of military strategists, Carl von Clausewitz, explains the importance of this decision-making in his treatise \"On War\": \"The first, the supreme, the most decisive act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish...the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, nor trying to turn it into something that is alien to its nature.\" Clausewitz's excellent advice about the absolute necessity of properly defining the war upon which a nation is about to embark was ignored by Bush administration officials who instead declared an open-ended and ambiguous \"war on terror\" after the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001. Bush took the nation to war against a tactic, rather than a war against a specific enemy, which was obviously al Qaeda and anyone allied to it. When the United States went to war against the Nazis and the Japanese during World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt and his congressional supporters did not declare war against U-boats and kamikaze pilots, but on the Nazi state and Imperial Japan. The war on terror, sometimes known as the \"Global War on Terror\" or by the clunky acronym GWOT, became the lens through which the Bush administration judged almost all of its foreign policy decisions. That proved to be dangerously counterproductive on several levels. The GWOT framework propelled the Bush administration into its disastrous entanglement in Iraq. It had nothing to do with 9/11 but was launched under the rubric of the war on terror and the erroneous claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The theory was that he might give such weapons to terrorists, including al Qaeda to whom he was supposedly allied, and that he therefore threatened American interests. None of this, of course, turned out to be true. The Bush administration's approach to the war on terror collided badly with another of its doctrines, spreading democracy in the Middle East as a panacea to reduce radicalism. It pushed for elections in the Palestinian territories in which, in early 2006, the more radical Hamas won a resounding victory, propelled to power on a wave of popular revulsion for the incompetence and corruption of the Fatah party that had dominated Palestinian politics since the 1960s. Imprisoned by its war on terror framework, the Bush administration supported Israel in a disastrous war against Hezbollah in Lebanon in the summer of 2006. Hezbollah is not only a terrorist group but is also part of the rickety Lebanese government and runs social welfare services across the country, yet for the Bush administration its involvement in terrorism was all that mattered. As is now widely understood in Israel, the war against Hezbollah was a moral and tactical defeat for the Israeli military and government. Events in the current Israeli incursion in Gaza will determine whether history repeats itself. Under the banner of the war on terror, the Bush administration also tied itself in conceptual knots conflating the threat from al Qaeda with Shiite groups like Hezbollah and the ayatollahs in Iran. In 2006, for instance, President Bush claimed that \"the Sunni and Shiite extremist represent different faces of the same threat.\" In reality, Sunni and Shiite extremists have been killing each other in large numbers for years in countries from Pakistan to Iraq. The groups have differing attitudes toward the United States, which Sunni extremists attacked in 1993 and again on 9/11, while Shiite militants have never done so. So, how to reconceptualize the GWOT? Contrary to a common view among Europeans, who have lived through the bombing campaigns of various nationalist and leftist terror groups for decades, al Qaeda is not just another criminal/terrorist group that can be dealt with by police action and law enforcement alone. After all, a terrorist organization like the Irish Republican Army would call in warnings before its attacks and its single largest massacre killed 29 people. By contrast, al Qaeda has declared war on the United States repeatedly -- as it did for the first time to a Western audience during Osama bin Laden's 1997 interview with CNN. Following that declaration of war, the terror group attacked American embassies, a U.S. warship, the Pentagon and the financial heart of the United States, killing thousands of civilians without warning; acts of war by any standard. Al Qaeda is obviously at war with the United States and so to respond by simply recasting the GWOT as the GPAT, the Global Police Action Against Terrorists, would be foolish and dangerous. What kind of war then should the United States fight against al Qaeda? For that we should learn some lessons from the conceptual errors of the Bush administration. Nine days after 9/11, Bush addressed Congress in a speech watched live by tens of millions of Americans in which he said that al Qaeda followed in the footsteps \"of the murderous ideologies of the 20th century...They follow in the path of fascism, Nazism and totalitarianism,\" implying that the fight against al Qaeda would be similar to World War II or the Cold War. For the Bush administration, painting the conflict in such existential terms had the benefit of casting the president as the heroic reincarnation of Winston Churchill and anyone who had the temerity to question him as the reincarnation of Hitler's arch-appeaser, Neville Chamberlain. But this portrayal of the war on terror was massively overwrought. The Nazis occupied and subjugated most of Europe and instigated a global conflict that killed tens of millions. And when the United States fought the Nazis, the country spent 40 percent of its gross domestic product to do so and fielded millions of soldiers. In his inaugural address, Obama should say that the United States is indeed at \"war against al Qaeda and its allies,\" but that as Roosevelt said in his inaugural address in 1933, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. If Americans are not terrorized by terrorists, then the U.S. has won against them. Al Qaeda and its allies are threats to the United States and Americans living and working overseas, but they are far from all-powerful. Barring an exceptional event like September 11, 2001, in any given year Americans are more likely to die of snake bites or lightning strikes than a terrorist attack. Despite the hyperventilating rhetoric of Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda's amateur investigations into weapons of mass destruction do not compare to the very real possibility of nuclear conflagration that we faced during the Cold War. There are relatively few adherents of Binladen-ism in the West today, while there were tens of millions of devotees of communism and fascism. Obama should also make it clear that instead of the Bush formulation of \"Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists,\" the Obama administration doctrine will be, \"Anyone who is against the terrorists is with us.\" After all it is only al Qaeda and its several affiliates in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Algeria and allied groups such as the Taliban that kill U.S. soldiers and civilians and attack American interests around the globe. Everyone else in the world is a potential or actual ally in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates, because those organizations threaten almost every category of institution, government and ethnic grouping.

Heavily armed Nigerian rebels pose a constant threat to oil pipelines in the country. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), a rebel group, said \"detonation engineers backed by heavily armed fighters\" sabotaged two of Shell's pipelines early Monday. After a helicopter flyover of the area, Shell confirmed that parts of its large Nembe Creek \"trunk line\" were damaged, company spokeswoman Caroline Wittgen said. The company shut down some production \"to limit the amount of crude that will spill into the environment,\" she said. Hours later, it declared \"force majeure,\" a legal term meaning it could not meet its supply obligations in the region because of the attack. \"[Shell] is working hard to repair the line and restore production,\" Wittgen said. Nigeria is the fourth-largest supplier of oil to the United States, and attacks by rebels have helped fuel the year-long spike in crude oil prices. It's one of many factors pushing up the price of gas in the U.S., where one in every 10 barrels of oil comes from Nigeria. MEND -- the largest rebel group -- has targeted foreign oil companies since 2006. It has bombed pipelines and kidnapped hundreds of foreign oil workers, typically releasing them unharmed, sometimes after receiving a ransom payment. MEND hopes to secure a greater share of oil wealth for people in the delta, where more than 70 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day. Its attacks on oil facilities have taken a toll. \"Anytime a pipeline is affected, anytime any production gets shut down, you see oil prices jump up one or two dollars a barrel just because there is no slack in the system,\" said Jim LeCamp, a senior vice president with RBC Wealth Management, which manages assets for wealthy clients worldwide. Exxon and Shell are two of several companies that have been extracting 2 million barrels of oil a day in Nigeria. Recent rebel attacks on oil pipelines in the Niger Delta have cut overall production by roughly 10 percent -- meaning 200,000 fewer barrels of oil on some days. That decrease in production comes at a time of increased demand from oil-hungry regions such as China, Russia and Latin America. \"Anytime there's a disruption there, it really affects the system,\" LeCamp said in a recent interview with CNN.", "f5ba7bfd3a297c525fb15e4f5caa15f355da81f1": "(CNN) -- Russian energy monopoly Gazprom on Wednesday said it would stop natural gas deliveries to Ukraine over a dispute about payments. Gazprom chief executive Alexei Miller accused Ukraine of using the issue as \"a political bargaining chip.\" Gazprom chief Alexey Miller said talks with Ukraine have been \"unproductive\" and accused Ukraine of using the issue as \"a political bargaining chip.\" \"The talks with Ukraine haven't brought any concrete result ... Gazprom hasn't received any money from Ukraine as payment for the supplies of Russian gas,\" Miller said in a statement on the Gazprom Web site. The state-controlled Gazprom said supplies to its other European customers would not be affected by Ukraine's cut-off, which the company said would take place at 10 a.m. Thursday (2 a.m. ET). Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko also assured the European Union that there would be no disruptions in deliveries, the Kiev Post reported. Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko called \"for every effort to be made for the earliest possible signature of an agreement with Russia,\" Yuschenko energy security commissioner, Bohdan Sokolovsky, told the Russian news agency Interfax on Wednesday evening.  Watch a report on Gazprom's threats to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine \u00bb . It is the second time in three years Gazprom has threatened to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine. The company made good on its threat on January 1, 2006, but turned the spigots back on a day later. Russia, the world's biggest producer of natural gas, supplies Europe with more than 40 percent of its imports -- mainly via pipelines that cross the former Soviet republic of Ukraine. Ukraine owes Gazprom about $2 billion for past natural gas deliveries. Ukraine's state-controlled energy company, Naftogaz Ukrainy, initially denied it owed the payment to Gazprom, but later retreated from that claim. The Kiev Post reported Tuesday that Naftogaz said it had paid $1.5 billion toward the debt, but Gazprom said it had not received the payment. Also at issue is Gazprom's contract for 2009 deliveries. Gazprom had wanted to more than double Ukraine's payments, but on Wednesday offered a much lesser payment of $250 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas. Ukraine, which currently pays about $100 per 1,000 cubic meters, balked at that figure. \"We have heard a negative reply to the offers from the Russian side on the favorable terms of gas supply to Ukraine in 2009, and we are getting the impression that there are political forces in Ukraine which have a strong interest in the gas standoff between our two countries,\" Miller said.", "890deccbe5bef58962617b66983fe74c8b65986c": "(CNN) -- A Louisiana teenager whose 2006 arrest in the racially charged \"Jena 6\" assault case drew thousands of protesters tried to commit suicide days after a separate arrest last week, a police report says. Mychal Bell was released in September 2007 and later agreed to a plea deal in the beating of a classmate. Mychal Bell, who was arrested last week after allegedly stealing clothes worth $370 from a department store, told investigators he shot himself Monday evening \"because he was tired of all the media attention,\" the report says.   The high school senior's mother and his grandmother also told an investigator that he'd indicated \"he did not feel like he could live anymore\" because of media coverage of the shoplifting allegations, according to the report. Earlier, Bell's attorney, Carol Powell-Lexing, told CNN that Bell's family told her he'd accidentally shot himself while cleaning a gun. According to the police report, however, an officer responded to a 911 call from his grandmother's Monroe, Louisiana, home, where Bell lives. The grandmother, Rosie Simmons, told the officer that she had hidden the gun after the shooting \"for Mychal's safety so he did not try to shot [sic] himself again,\" according to the report. Bell, 18, suffered a wound to the upper right chest, the report says. Powell-Lexing told CNN that Bell had surgery Monday night, and Monroe police Sgt. Cassandra Wooten said the wound was not life-threatening. Bell was being treated Tuesday at a hospital in Shreveport, Louisiana. In December 2006, Bell was one of a half-dozen black teenagers who faced felony charges in the beating of a white classmate in the town of Jena, Louisiana, an incident that followed months of racial tensions in the community of about 3,000 people. The case of the \"Jena 6\" drew national attention from civil rights groups that said the charges were excessive, and an estimated 15,000-plus people turned out for a September 2007 rally in Jena on the youths' behalf. Bell eventually pleaded guilty to battery in a juvenile court and later moved to Monroe, about 70 miles north of Jena. On Christmas Eve, Bell was arrested at the Pecanland Mall in Monroe and charged with shoplifting, simple battery and resisting arrest, Monroe Police Lt. Jeff Davis said Tuesday. Bell was released on $1,300 bond, and the case was assigned to city court.  Watch CNN's Sean Callebs report on the case \u00bb . On Monday, Simmons and Bell's mother, Melissa Bell, told investigators they heard a gunshot from the teenager's room and found him on the bed, according to the police report. \"Rosie and M. Bell stated Mychal had made comments over the past two days that because of the current media attention he had because of a shoplifting arrest he did not feel like he could live anymore,\" the police report says. Monroe police Lt. Jeff Harris said investigators do not know whose gun Bell used. Bell's Christmas Eve arrest came after security guards at the shopping center were told Bell and a male friend were seen stuffing clothing into a bag in a menswear section of Dillard's, according to the investigative report. Once spotted, the men split up, police said. Bell, chased by security guards, ran from the store to a parking lot, where he tried to hide under a car, Davis said. As a store security officer tried to pull Bell out, \"Bell swung his arms wildly\" and hit the guard with his elbow, the report says. Davis said the guard was hit in the face. Bell admitted to the thefts, which police said included four shirts and a pair of jeans, Davis said. The merchandise was photographed by store security and returned to stock, he added. Bell was taken to jail and booked. Davis said the second man escaped. Powell-Lexing told CNN her client went to the mall with someone to return a shirt, for which he had a receipt. The person with Bell did the shoplifting, and Bell was caught in the middle, the attorney said. Powell-Lexing said Bell has been trying to stay out of trouble since the Jena arrest, and that he has been on the verge of getting a college football scholarship. Bell attends a Monroe high school, but has not been allowed to play high school football since his arrest in Jena, where he was a running back. In April, after his move to Monroe, Bell told CNN that he wanted to keep his life on the straight and narrow in part because of the support he received during the Jena case. \"I feel like [after] all the people came down and supported me [and] gave money to the defense fund, I feel like ... if I would do something now, I would let the whole country down,\" he said.

Former transit officer Johannes Mehserle is charged with homicide in the death of Oscar Grant III. Johannes Mehserle, 27, appeared in a packed Alameda County courtroom, with his supporters separated by a courtroom aisle from relatives of shooting victim Oscar Grant III and other spectators. Mehserle is charged with shooting Grant, 22, in an incident that spurred violent protests in Oakland after being captured on video. Mehserle resigned his job as a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer days after the shooting, and he was arrested in Nevada earlier this week. Thursday's proceedings took less than five minutes, with Mehserle appearing behind heavy windows in an enclosure out of view of all but a handful of spectators. Superior Court Judge Robert McGuinness ordered the ex-officer held until his next hearing, scheduled for January 26.

A small aircraft drops a ransom payment during a flight over the Sirius Star on Friday. \"The supertanker VLCC Sirius Star is currently under way to safe waters,\" Andrew Mwangura of the Kenya Seafarers Association said in an e-mail. Mwangura said all 23 crew members of the Sirius Star, the largest ship ever hijacked by pirates, are safe and in good health. They are citizens of Croatia, Great Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia. \"Anytime a ship is released, it is positive news,\" said Cmdr. Jane Campbell of the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. \"But too many people see it as a ship and its cargo being released. When merchant mariners are released, it is always good news.\" The ship is a VLCC, or \"very large crude carrier.\" According to the Fifth Fleet, the tanker is more than three times the size of a U.S. navy aircraft carrier. Pirates seized the supertanker November 15. The tanker was carrying two million barrels of crude oil worth about $100 million. The Liberian-flagged tanker is owned by Vela International Marine Ltd., a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabian-based Saudi Aramco. Saleh K'aki, president and CEO of Vela International, said in a statement, \"We are very relieved to know that all crew members are safe and I am glad to say that they are all in good health and high spirits. This has been a very trying time for them and certainly for their families. We are very happy to report to their families that they will be on their way home soon.\" Mwangura said it would have been a \"disaster\" if the pirates had fired guns aboard the ship, harming the cargo or igniting a fire. \"The capture of the Sirius Star raised the specter of an environmental disaster should the hijackers decide to turn the ship into a weapon or foreign navies attempt to release it by force,\" he said. The pirates had been expected to release the supertanker after receiving the ransom payment Friday, but four pirates drowned after their skiff capsized in rough seas while they were leaving the Sirius Star, according to a journalist who spoke to one of the pirates on board.  Watch ransom being parachuted to ship \u00bb . There were five pirates in the skiff and one survived, the journalist said. The bodies of the other four were recovered, he said. The pirates told another journalist they received $3 million in ransom money but lost part of it when the skiff capsized. \"Initially, the gunmen were demanding $25 million for its release but the latest reports indicate that the demand had been lowered to below $3.5 million,\" Mwangura said. Meanwhile, pirates also have released the MV Delight, an Iranian chartered ship carrying wheat from Germany, Mwangura said. It was captured in November. Details were not immediately available. Hijackings off East Africa are a cause of growing international concern, spurring a number of international navies to patrol the pirate-wracked Gulf of Aden. Dozens of ships have been attacked in the gulf by pirates based in a largely lawless Somalia in recent months.  See how pirate attacks are on the rise \u00bb . Campbell said the number of attacks may have gone up in recent months, but the number of successful hijackings has gone down. She attributed that to measures taken by merchant ships, such as vigilant keeping of watch and evasive ship maneuvers, and the increased naval presence in the at-risk areas. Campbell stressed, however, that they are only preventive measures. \"Piracy is a problem that starts on the shore,\" she said. \"The international community needs to address the situation on the ground in Somalia.\" CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.", "15050103702a56981c082c69c415f8667f1f2115": "Editor's note: For 85 years, Yankee Stadium has hosted some of the greatest  moments in sports. On Sunday, the Yankees will play their last game before the stadium is torn down. Former Yankee pitcher Jim Bouton played on the 1963 American League All-Star team and in two World Series. He wrote the classic baseball book, \"Ball Four,\" named as one of the \"Books of the Century\" by the New  York Public Library, and has been a sportscaster and actor. For Bouton's web site, click here . Jim Bouton was photographed as a rookie in 1962 at Yankee Stadium, before the renovation of the ballpark. EGREMONT, Massachusetts (CNN) -- I'll never forget my first day in The House that Ruth Built:  April 9, 1962, the day before opening day. I made the team that spring as a non-roster player, having pitched in the Texas League (AA) the year before. And I had just turned 23. The Yankees had scheduled an afternoon workout, but I was so excited that I couldn't sleep and I drove in from my parents' house in New Jersey at 7 in the morning. After introducing myself to a skeptical guard, he led me down two flights of stairs and through a hallway, where I was greeted by the clubhouse man Pete Sheehy (who died in 1985 and for whom the room is now named). The Yankee clubhouse in 1962 was like a large subterranean living room. A wall-to-wall grayish green carpet muffled all sound, and the overhead lighting was subdued. Three walls of walk-in wood lockers faced a wall of large frosted windows that cast shafts of light from the street above. Everything was painted a muted gray green to match the carpet, including the exposed ductwork in the ceiling above. A cleat-dented wooden stool sat in front of each locker. And hanging in the lockers, with military precision, were the classic Yankee uniforms. \"Your locker is right here by the door,\" said Pete. I couldn't help smiling when I saw Whitey Ford's nameplate just one locker away. I asked Pete if this was the same room that Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig and all those guys used. He pointed to a locker across the room where he used to bring \"a bi-carb and coffee\" each day to the Babe. Pete returned to his duties and I touched my uniform reverently. With no one around, I decided to try it on. Perfect fit. I adjusted my hat in a mirror. That looked good, too. iReport.com: Share your memories of Yankee Stadium . Then I grabbed my glove and went out to the field -- you know, just to get oriented. After sitting in the dugout a few minutes, I trotted out to the mound. Looking up at the three tiers of stands was like being in the Roman Coliseum. Of course, I had to toe the rubber and look in for the sign. Fortunately, at that hour of the morning, it was just me and the pigeons. What would it be like to pitch there when the stands were filled with people? My big chance came on May 7, 1962, in the second game of a double-header against the Washington Senators, in front of a real crowd that included my Mom and Dad, my brothers and a whole bunch of neighbors from New Jersey. I was thrilled and scared at the same time -- maybe a little more on the scared side. I walked the bases loaded with nobody out. Then I fell behind 3 and 1 on the fourth hitter. My next pitch was a little bit high and manager Ralph Houk stepped out of the dugout - either to calm me down or remove me from the premises. But the umpire, bless him, called it a strike and Houk stepped back into the dugout. The inning seemed to last forever, but I finally got out of it and ended up pitching a complete game shutout. Maybe the worst shutout in history - 7 walks and 7 hits. After the game Houk said to me, \"any more shutouts like that and we're going to need a new bullpen.\" The best part was when I walked into the clubhouse after the game. I arrived a few minutes late because I'd done a TV interview in the dugout. And when I opened the door, there was a path of white towels leading to my locker -- and Mickey Mantle was laying down the last towel. This is my favorite memory of Yankee Stadium. Unless it was Mantle's 9th inning walk-off home run in '64 World Series that beat the Cardinals 2-1, which also happened to be my first World Series win. After that it was all down hill. In 1968 a sore arm got me traded to the Seattle Pilots for a bag of batting practice balls. That's the year I kept a diary that became Ball Four -- a book that also mentioned Mantle hitting a home run with a hangover -- which got me banned from Old Timers Day at Yankee Stadium for 28 years. My eventual return to Yankee Stadium came after my son Michael wrote a letter to the New York Times, saying the Yankees should let bygones be bygones and invite me back. It was such a beautiful letter the Yankees were embarrassed into inviting me. After 28 years, Yankee Stadium was a different place -- a strange and garish place. A makeover in 1973-75, under the new owner George Steinbrenner, added cantilevered stands that destroyed the elegant upper fa\u00e7ade, and exterior elevators which spoiled the view of the of the lower facade. Inside, the grayish green carpet was now bright blue and featured a giant Yankee logo. The honest ceiling with its exposed pipes was now a dropped ceiling with stark white tiles. Everything was painted blue and white -- the Yankee colors, get it? Now, instead of restoring the stadium, they're going to tear it down. Raze the clubhouse where Pete Sheehy made coffee for Ruth. Destroy the dugout where Stengel slept. Bulldoze the field where Mantle roamed and level the mound where Larsen pitched the only perfect World Series game. And they're going to build an underground parking garage on the site! This will no doubt be \"The Garage that Ruth Built\" -- which could produce a reverse \"Curse of the Bambino.\" If you check the current standings, you'll see this may already be happening.

Watch Berretta describe the landing \u00bb . As the plane headed down toward the river, the cabin was mostly silent, he said. \"After he told us prepare for impact, it was pretty evident we were not going to make the runway.\" At first, it felt like the plane was gliding, Berretta said, as if no engines were working. \"People started praying, and there was a lot of silence, and the realization that we were going in was really hard to take in at that moment,\" he said. As the plane started to go down, some passengers shouted to those in exit rows to be prepared to quickly open the doors. Berretta spent that time contemplating the chances of surviving a water crash. \"I think that [it] certainly went through my mind that this probably very much could be it,\" he said. Then the plane hit the water. Panero said the impact felt like a car crash. Some said that as the plane hit, there were extremely loud noises. \"The plane was jockeying about, spinning a bit,\" Berretta said. \"Then all of a sudden, it was 'Get out, get out now,' \" Panero said. Jeff Kolodjay was sitting in seat 22A right next to the engine believed to have caused the plane to go down. \"The plane started filling with water pretty quick,\" he said. \"It was scary. There was a lady with her baby on my left-hand shoulder, and she was crawling over the seats.\" Upon impact, passengers left behind their coats and luggage. They grabbed life vests and seat cushions and headed toward the exits. \"It seemed like it lasted an eternity,\" Berretta said.

Watch Panero describe what he saw and heard \u00bb . \"But there was a couple of people who kind of took charge and just started yelling to calm down, just to get everybody out,\" he said. \"Once people realized that we were going to be OK, everybody kind of calmed down and just tried to get out of the plane to safety.\" Passengers began to group themselves on the wings to stay out of the frigid water. When they were safely out of the plane, Berretta said, there was one more moment of fear. \"Our raft was tethered to the plane, and we worried we might go down with the plane,\" he said. \"But we were able to get a knife off a rescue boat and cut the tether.\" More than anything, passengers wanted to thank the crew. As Berretta exited the plane, he said that besides a few passengers remaining, the crew and pilot stayed behind to make sure everyone was out. \"I think the pilot, he did a great job,\" Berretta said. \"I think it was as good of a landing as you can make in a river.\"", "b313cdebb8f09af65296e8f186d9ca1e407e2a88": "LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- Royal Dutch Shell said Tuesday that it may not be able to meet its oil supply obligations in Nigeria after an attack on its major pipeline. Heavily armed Nigerian rebels pose a constant threat to oil pipelines in the country. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), a rebel group, said \"detonation engineers backed by heavily armed fighters\" sabotaged two of Shell's pipelines early Monday. After a helicopter flyover of the area, Shell confirmed that parts of its large Nembe Creek \"trunk line\" were damaged, company spokeswoman Caroline Wittgen said. The company shut down some production \"to limit the amount of crude that will spill into the environment,\" she said. Hours later, it declared \"force majeure,\" a legal term meaning it could not meet its supply obligations in the region because of the attack. \"[Shell] is working hard to repair the line and restore production,\" Wittgen said. Nigeria is the fourth-largest supplier of oil to the United States, and attacks by rebels have helped fuel the year-long spike in crude oil prices. It's one of many factors pushing up the price of gas in the U.S., where one in every 10 barrels of oil comes from Nigeria. MEND -- the largest rebel group -- has targeted foreign oil companies since 2006. It has bombed pipelines and kidnapped hundreds of foreign oil workers, typically releasing them unharmed, sometimes after receiving a ransom payment. MEND hopes to secure a greater share of oil wealth for people in the delta, where more than 70 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day. Its attacks on oil facilities have taken a toll. \"Anytime a pipeline is affected, anytime any production gets shut down, you see oil prices jump up one or two dollars a barrel just because there is no slack in the system,\" said Jim LeCamp, a senior vice president with RBC Wealth Management, which manages assets for wealthy clients worldwide. Exxon and Shell are two of several companies that have been extracting 2 million barrels of oil a day in Nigeria. Recent rebel attacks on oil pipelines in the Niger Delta have cut overall production by roughly 10 percent -- meaning 200,000 fewer barrels of oil on some days. That decrease in production comes at a time of increased demand from oil-hungry regions such as China, Russia and Latin America. \"Anytime there's a disruption there, it really affects the system,\" LeCamp said in a recent interview with CNN.", "67d3beb0dd9ca7e0553bff4f37171e8c9d394285": "(CNN) -- In style and substance, Barack Obama is looking like he could be a different president than the candidate voters got to know during the campaign. Barack Obama has taken on a more somber tone as he prepares to take office. His message of changing the country has been replaced by one of repairing the country as he inherits crises that demand immediate action. \"I want to be realistic here,\" Obama said in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"Not everything that we talked about during the campaign are we going to be able to do on the pace that we had hoped.\" During the campaign, Obama stressed fixing the economy as one of his top priorities, but his recent language has taken on an urgent tone. Obama painted a dire picture of the economy last week, warning that if Congress does not take \"dramatic action\" on his economic aid package as soon as possible, the nation would face devastating long-term consequences. \"For every day we wait or point fingers or drag our feet, more Americans will lose their jobs. More families will lose their savings. More dreams will be deferred and denied. And our nation will sink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse,\" he said. It's a far cry from what voters heard from Obama the Democratic candidate, who inspired roaring crowds of thousands by telling them, \"This is our moment. This is our time.\" But with the economy in a recession and people afraid for their financial future, Obama's soaring campaign rhetoric has given way to grim reality. And as if the economic crisis weren't enough, Obama has an international crisis awaiting him as well. The president-elect said Sunday that the suffering on both sides of Gaza's borders has led him to ramp up his commitment to working for a peace deal in the Middle East. These urgent items on Obama's agenda are forcing his team to reconsider some campaign pledges. Just as soon as he went from presidential hopeful to president-elect, Obama warned the nation of tough times ahead and lowered expectations that he would be the one to solve it all.  Watch more on the expectations for Obama \u00bb . \"We know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime -- two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century,\" he said on the night of his election victory. \"The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there,\" he said. He told voters that change couldn't happen without them, \"without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice.\" He reiterated that same message this weekend, explaining what it's going to take to reform the government. \"Everybody is going to have to give. Everybody is going to have to have some skin in the game,\" Obama told ABC. iReport.com: What should Obama do first? Some of the pledges Obama might have to rethink include his proposal to give some homeowners a 10 percent tax credit, an idea that has little support in Congress. During the campaign, Obama also told voters, \"I don't believe in running up debt for the next generation.\" But just last week, he acknowledged that the cost of the economic recovery plan he is pushing would be \"considerable\" and would \"certainly add to the budget deficit in the short term.\" Obama has not put a price tag on his stimulus package, but observers have estimated it would cost in the neighborhood of $800 billion. Obama also has proposed repealing the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy, but now it's more likely that the president-elect will delay any tax increases on the wealthy until 2011, when the tax cuts expire. Some of the maneuvering is aimed at attracting Republican support for the incoming president's recovery plan, but that could set up an early battle in the now heavily Democratic Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for example, is adamant about seeing those tax cuts repealed. iReport.com: What does Obama's presidency mean to you? Obama says everyone will have to sacrifice, and that includes Congress, too. Some political observers say the economic crisis that Obama is inheriting is raising the stakes to get a move on his recovery plan -- even if Congress isn't 100 percent behind it. \"This strengthens Barack Obama's hand with the Congress and with the public. It's so urgent, that it's going to be very, very hard, I think, for people who don't like parts of this package to vote against it,\" said David Gergen, CNN's senior political analyst. And while the public is well aware of the economic battle ahead, Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ed Rollins said Obama has little time to wait. \"You've got to have results,\" Rollins said, \"He doesn't have four years to get it done. He has two years. If there's not improvements dramatically in two years, you have a midterm election, and certainly by the second part of this first term, this economy better be moving.\" CNN's Jim Acosta, Kristi Keck and Christine Romans contributed to this report .", "e96f6af54a156f2c21b11c626a9ea60e8a4d760f": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There was no shortage of superstars in Washington this week, including the middle school students of Atlanta, Georgia's Ron Clark Academy.

An age-progression photo shows what Adam Herrman would like today, as a 21-year-old man. Sheriff Craig Murphy would not disclose details about the residence or why authorities want to search it. He said his department will also search on an area of the Whitewater River, in southern Kansas, on Saturday near where Adam Herrman was last seen. Adam was 11 when he went missing in 1999. He was living in a mobile home park in Towanda, a town about 25 miles northeast of Wichita, with his adoptive parents, Doug and Valerie Herrman, authorities said. Wichita attorney Warner Eisenbise, who is representing Adam's adoptive parents, said the couple believed Adam had run away and didn't report him missing. They \"really rue the fact that they didn't\" report him missing, he said Monday. A few weeks ago, an undisclosed person contacted the Wichita-Sedgwick County Exploited and Missing Child Unit, expressing concern about Adam, the sheriff said. The Herrmans told Eisenbise that Adam ran away frequently, the attorney said, and they believed he was either with his biological parents or homeless. Although the Herrmans did not report him missing, \"they were very worried about him,\" Eisenbise said. In an interview published Tuesday in The Wichita Eagle, Valerie Herrman said Adam ran away in May 1999 after she spanked him with a belt. She said she was upset but doesn't remember why, The Eagle reported. The couple never reported Adam missing, Valerie Herrman told the paper, because they feared authorities would take Adam and his siblings away because of the spanking. The couple adopted his two younger siblings as well, according to The Eagle. \"We love him, and we made a terrible mistake\" by not reporting him missing, Doug Herrman told The Eagle. The couple said they searched the mobile home park and other areas for two days after Adam left. \"Then we came to the conclusion that the police probably have him, and they're coming to us, probably to get us in trouble,\" Doug Herrman told the newspaper, but the \"police never came.\" Authorities have searched an empty lot in the Pine Ridge Mobile Home Park where the family lived. There, police found an \"answer\" to one of their questions, Murphy said Monday without elaborating. Eisenbise said that on December 15, authorities also searched the Herrmans' homes in Derby, outside of Wichita, and took the couple's computer, he said. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has released an age-progression picture that depicts Adam as he might appear now: a young man with blue eyes and light-colored hair. Adam had been placed in the Herrmans' care when he was about 2, Murphy said Monday. He had been named Irvin Groeninger III when he was born June 8, 1987, Murphy said, and it was not clear when his name was changed. His biological parents relinquished their rights as parents about two decades ago, and Adam and his siblings were put in foster homes, CNN affiliate KWCH reported. \"I thought what I was doing for them was in the best interest of the children, and evidently it wasn't,\" Irvin Groeninger, Adam's biological father,  told KWCH. \"If he was still in my custody, this would have never happened.\" Adam's sister, Tiffany Broadfoot, 22, said she had last seen her brother about 14 years ago at a birthday party. \"He had the cutest little round face, little-bitty freckles right up here on the tip of his cheek,\" she told the station.

Commuters drive along a road in downtown Beijing, China, on Thursday. The Chinese government revised its growth figures for 2007 from 11.9 percent to 13 percent this week, bringing its estimated gross domestic product to $3.4 trillion -- about 3 percent larger than Germany's $3.3 trillion for the same year, based on World Bank estimates. Beijing is expected to release its 2008 GDP figures next week. Although the world's top economies, the United States and Japan, are in recession, the most pessimistic estimates for China's growth in upcoming years runs about 5 percent. That could allow China's GDP to overtake Japan's, currently $4.3 trillion, within a few years. The U.S. economy, the world's largest, was about $13.8 trillion in 2007. The World Bank's estimate of China's economic growth is about 7.5 percent. But China has seen a sharp decline in exports in November and December as other major economies struggle, and the bank's analysts say rates below 6 percent could worsen the rest of the world's slump.

A man carries drinking water through the flooded streets of Gonaives, Haiti, on Monday. Nine of the deaths were attributed to Fay, 79 to Gustav, 183 to Hanna and 70 to Ike, said Abel Nazaire, deputy head of Haiti's Civil Protection Service. The country's fragile infrastructure was overloaded after the storms and officials were concerned that the floodwaters could spread disease, Sophie Boutaud de la Combe, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, said Tuesday. Gonaives, on the west coast, is one of the hardest-hit cities. This week, Gonaives was knee-deep in filthy water and reachable only by water or air, with many of Haiti's bridges destroyed and roads flooded. \"My home is destroyed. I have no place to live with my kids. Everything I had just washed away,\" Roselene Josef told CNN.  Watch desperate survivors in Gonaives \u00bb . Another survivor said, \"The flood washed away everything. I couldn't save anything. They should just move this city. Floods always destroy it.\" Aid workers warned of a deepening humanitarian crisis as attempts to deliver aid were frustrated by logistical problems. The U.S. Navy's USS Kearsarge arrived in the waters off Haiti on Monday to support the U.S. Agency for International Development's efforts to assist after the devastation. The vessel will help move cargo and equipment between affected cities and will deliver relief supplies, said the U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command. But Monday, the Kearsarge wasn't able to deliver anything to Gonaives, because the ship's scout helicopters couldn't find a suitable place for supplies to be unloaded, according to The Associated Press. A U.S. Coast Guard ship carrying 35 tons of relief supplies arrived Saturday in Gonaives. The U.S. cutter was preceded by a ship carrying U.N. relief supplies, including 19 tons of high-energy biscuits, 50,000 bottles of water and water purification tablets, which arrived Friday in Gonaives, said Myrta Kaulard of the United Nations' World Food Program. CNN's Karl Penhaul watched as U.N. troops handed out scant supplies of food and water to a long line of Haitians.  The line became chaotic, with people fighting over supplies.  Watch the devastation Penhaul found in Haiti \u00bb . Hundreds of people had taken shelter in a school. They told Penhaul they had not received relief aid in a week. An official in Gonaives told the AP on Monday that nine people had died in shelters, including two children. It was not clear if they had died of starvation or some other cause, Daniel Dupiton of the region's civil protection department told the AP. When floodwaters were at their highest, some residents camped out on their roofs, their clothing and blankets hung over the sides of buildings. Some people \"have lost really everything. ... These are not rich people, these are people who were really struggling [already] against high food prices,\" Kaulard said. U.S. Navy Capt. Frank Ponds said he had flown over part of southern and northern Haiti. \"I saw towns that were completely flooded,\" Ponds said. \"I saw infrastructure, such as bridge[s] and roads, totally wiped out.\" The eye of Hurricane Ike never touched Haiti earlier this week, but the storm system did bring heavy rains and winds to Gonaives and other towns. Jean Pierre Guiteau, executive director for the Red Cross in Haiti, said 52 people were killed when a river burst its banks in the mountain town of Cabaret near the capital, Port-au-Prince.

An artist's sketch shows Ignacio Ramos, left, and Jose Compean. The prison sentences of Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean will now end March 20. Ramos had received an 11-year prison sentence; Compean had received a 12-year term. They began serving their sentences in January 2007. The Office of the Pardon Attorney was still reviewing the clemency request when Bush made his decision, Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said. \"The president has reviewed the circumstances of this case as a whole and the conditions of confinement and believes the sentences they received are too harsh and that they, and their families, have suffered enough for their crimes,\" a senior administration official said. \"Commuting their sentences does not diminish the seriousness of their crimes. Ramos and Compean are convicted felons who violated their oaths to uphold the law and have been severely punished,\" the official stated. \"This commutation gives them an opportunity to return to their families and communities, but both men will have to carry the burden of being convicted felons and the shame of violating their oaths for the rest of their lives.\" The official noted that both Democratic and Republican members of Congress have supported a commutation, including President-elect Barack Obama's incoming White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, and Texas GOP Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn. The head of the labor union representing Border Patrol agents told CNN Radio he was \"grateful\" that Bush commuted the sentences but questioned why the prison terms won't end until March 20. \"I would be quite curious to learn why they have to wait another two months for an unjust sentence,\" said Rich Pierce, president of the National Border Patrol Council. He said the union's ultimate goal would be for the men to get their Border Patrol jobs back. The shooting happened February 17, 2005, on the border southeast of El Paso, Texas. During their trial, Ramos and Compean said the illegal immigrant, Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila, had brandished a gun while actively resisting arrest. Aldrete-Davila, however, said he was unarmed and was attempting to surrender when Compean attempted to beat him with a shotgun. Aldrete-Davila was shot while fleeing toward the Rio Grande. Ramos and Compean were ultimately convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon, lying about the incident and violating Aldrete-Davila's Fourth Amendment right against illegal search and seizure. After receiving immunity to testify in the case against the two agents, Aldrete-Davila was arrested in 2007 on charges of bringing more than 750 pounds of marijuana into the United States. The case quickly became a political flash point, with advocates of tighter border controls defending the agents and civil liberties groups saying that the agents had used illegal and excessive force against Aldrete-Davila. Bush has granted 189 pardons and 11 commutations over his eight years in office, far fewer than Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan in their two-term administrations. During the final months of the Bush administration, speculation has swirled around the question of whether former vice presidential aide Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby would be granted the presidential favor. Libby was convicted in March of 2007 of four counts of lying and impeding a federal investigation into the leak of information that revealed that Valerie Plame was a covert CIA operative. Among the more notable people who have applied for -- but not received -- some form of clemency are: former Rep. Randall \"Duke\" Cunningham, R-California, who was convicted of receiving bribes; publishing executive Conrad Black, who was found guilty of fraud; former junk bold salesman Michael Milken, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud;  and former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers, convicted of accounting fraud. The parents of John Walker Lindh, who was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty to supporting terrorists in Afghanistan, held a news conference in December urging Bush to commute their son's sentence. There is a long tradition of presidents issuing pardons and commutations during their final days in office. Clinton pardoned fugitive financier Marc Rich during his last hours in office, setting off a firestorm of controversy. A commutation reduces a convict's prison term, but the conviction remains on the person's record. A pardon, however, wipes the slate clean by erasing the record of the conviction. A president has the sole authority to grant clemency to whomever he chooses, although a Justice Department office usually reviews applications and makes recommendations after considering such standards as a person's degree of remorse and ability to lead a responsible and productive life after release. Those applying for a pardon through the Justice Department are required to wait at least five years after their conviction or release from confinement.", "85b3821389a8fd80d3a8c81370b0639c7fc1924a": "BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN)  -- At least 59 people were killed in a fire that broke out early Thursday at one of Bangkok's most upscale nightclubs, where about 1,000 revelers were ringing in the new year, Thai police said. Rescue officials work at the scene of the fire in Thailand. Most of the dead were Thai, but foreigners have been identified, among them from Australia, the Netherlands, Nepal and Japan, police said. Another 100 people were believed injured. The fire, at a club called Santika, started at about 12:35 a.m. (1735 GMT), police told CNN.

General Edwin Donayre, right, meets with Peruvian President Alan Garcia in Lima, Peru, last year. Chilean President Michelle Bachelet met Monday morning with her domestic advisers to discuss the matter after the Peruvian general appeared unrepentant over the weekend, the Chilean government reported on its Web site. Peruvian President Alan Garc\u00eda had called Bachelet last week to say that the statements by Gen. Edwin Donayre are not the official policy of Peru. Bachelet said at the time she was satisfied with Garc\u00eda's explanation and it was \"up to the government of Peru to take measures.\" Donayre made the remarks in 2006 or 2007 at a party at a friend's house, said CNN affiliate station TVN in Santiago, Chile. The video was downloaded to YouTube in February and surfaced a week ago to wider attention. \"We are not going to let Chileans pass by,\" Donayre says in the amateur-quality video as he offers a toast. \"Chilean who enters will not leave. Or will leave in a coffin. And if there aren't sufficient coffins, there will be plastic bags.\" Tensions rose over the weekend when Donayre, who is scheduled to retire Friday, was widely quoted in Peru and Chile as saying that he will not be forced to resign early due to external pressure. \"I was named commander general under a presidential mandate and I can only be relieved under such an order. Not by necessity nor under pressure from another government,\" Donayre said, acording to the Peruvian Andina news agency. Further heightening tensions, Donayre was quoted as saying that Peruvian citizens have a right to say whatever they want at private functions. \"I want to express and specify that it was not a speech nor a public act,\" Andina quotes the general as saying. \"The situation in which what happened at a private gathering was spread worries me.\" In the video, Donayre is surrounded by other uniformed army officials as well as people in civilian dress. It is not clear from the video in what context the general was making his comments. Nor was it clear in what forum Donayre made his comments over the weekend. After Bachelet's meeting with top aides Monday, government spokesman Francisco Vidal declined to say whether Chile's ambassador to Peru would be recalled in light of Donayre's weekend statements. \"General Donayre's declarations in the past 24 to 48 hours only convince us that we are right and that our government's posture is reasonable,\" Vidal said on the Chilean government Web site. In Peru, meanwhile, a member of Congress, Gustavo Espinoza, is under investigation, suspected of sending Donayre's videotaped comment to Chilean press and politicians. A political opponent said Espinoza has an \"unpatriotic attitude,\" the Andina news agency said. \"I would not have expected this conduct from any Peruvian, much less a member of Congress,\" said Aurelio Pastor. Espinoza is already serving a 120-day suspension for leaking a private conversation with another member of Congress, Andina said. Peruvian Defense Minister \u00c1ntero Flores-Ar\u00e1oz told reporters Saturday that relations between the two nations will be repaired, calling the Donayre incident \"a bump in the road.\" Flores-Ar\u00e1oz also said that Donayre's remarks about Chileans used \"improper terms\" that are not shared by the Peruvian people, Andina said. Peruvian Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Garc\u00eda Belaunde made similar assertions last week. Peru has not taken any measures against the general. His retirement Friday is required by law at the end of his two-year appointment as the army's top chief. Donayre has been the subject of an investigation in recent weeks concerning the use of 80,000 gallons of fuel under his control as commander of the southern military region in 2006. Chile and Peru have a long history of animosity, having fought in the War of the Pacific from 1879 to 1883. Hard feelings linger to this day. More recently, the two nations nearly came to war in 1975 when left-wing Peruvian leader Juan Velasco, who was backed by Cuba, wanted to invade Chile, which was led by right-wing Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The invasion was called off and Velasco was deposed in a coup a short while later. Tensions rose again when Peru discovered a Chilean spy mission, but war was averted. This year, the World Court agreed to look at an issue concerning Peruvian claims to a disputed maritime area.", "bea9b42b57ca3e76bf645bba90c167298b4d54a0": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There was no shortage of superstars in Washington this week, including the middle school students of Atlanta, Georgia's Ron Clark Academy.

When the crowd cheers, I feel like we did a good job,\" said Willie Thornton, a seventh-grader. \"I feel a lot of adrenaline afterwards.\" The students have met the Kenyan Boys Choir, who told their American counterparts what kind of animals they might see when the Ron Clark students travel to Kenya on a school trip in June. At another luncheon, the sixth- and seventh-graders were thrilled to catch a glimpse of actor Ed Norton, the man who played the Incredible Hulk. But he didn't compare to singer Beyonce, who closed Sunday's star-studded Lincoln Memorial concert and drew giggles and shouts. The kids gained notoriety just before the election when they appeared on CNN, singing \"You Can Vote However You Like.\" They became media favorites overnight, appearing on several networks and shows. Dressed neatly in their school uniform of khaki pants, light blue shirts and navy blue blazers, they discussed the Iraq war, the economy and taxes with the composure of adults. Their teacher, Ron Clark, known for his innovation, has used pop music to teach his students. He once changed the words of Rihanna's infectious hit \"Umbrella\" to teach geography. \"You have to give students something they can identify with, something that catches their enthusiasm and spirit,\" he said. \"I'm so proud of them all. They've taught me a lot.\" Before founding his school in the rough neighborhood of South Atlanta, Clark taught in Harlem, where he penned \"The Essential 55,\" a rule-book for educators that caught Oprah Winfrey's eye. She talked about it on her show, and it soon became a New York Times bestseller. This past Christmas, Clark received another gift from the talk show host: $365,000. Winfrey donated $1,000 for each day of the year. Clark has said that the money will help provide scholarships for a year. The teacher said he plans to incorporate Barack Obama's inauguration into lessons throughout the rest of the school year. \"Our school is about politics and world issues and helping the kids understand that they have an important role in all of that,\" he said.

About 30 people are missing, the official news agency Agencia Brasil said, citing civil defense officials. Earlier reports had indicated as many as 100 people were dead. In addition, more than 54,000 residents have been left homeless, and another 1.5 million have been affected by the heavy rains, the state news agency reported. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced he will release nearly 700 million reais ($350 million) on Wednesday, Agencia Brasil said. About 50 federal police are being dispatched to Santa Catarina state, where most of the deaths and damage have occurred, Agencia Brasil said. The authorities will help look for victims and provide security for local businesses. Military police reported that four grocery stores were looted this week in the Santa Catarina city of Itajai, the news agency said. The rain-fueled flooding resulted in a declaration of public calamity in six municipalities -- Gaspar, Rio dos Cedros, Nova Trento, Camboriu, Benedito Novo and Pomerode, Agencia Brasil reported. Another seven municipalities have declared states of emergency -- Balne\u00e1rio de Pi\u00e7arras, Canelinha, Indaial, Penha, Paulo Lopes, Presidente Get\u00falio and Rancho Queimado, the news agency reported. Eight communities are cut off from the rest of the nation and have no water and electricity, Civil Defense officials said. The flooding has blocked more than 20 roads, and emergency supplies of food, water and coats are being brought in by helicopter. Health Minister Jose Gomes Temporao was scheduled to tour the affected areas Wednesday to meet with Santa Catarina Gov. Luiz Henrique da Silveira and announce emergency measures. The governor has called the situation the worst catastrophe in the state's history. Complicating matters, the flooding also ruptured a pipeline carrying gas between Brazil and Bolivia on Sunday night, interrupting the flow of gas in part of the country's southern region, Agencia Brasil said. Heavy rains have brought flooding to many parts of Central and South America. In Colombia, at least 34 people have died, and another eight are missing, officials said. About 50,000 people suffered damage to their property in northwestern Colombia after the Cauca River overflowed following heavy rains. The Cauca -- a tributary of the Magdalena River, the largest in Colombia -- broke through its levees Tuesday and flooded the town of Nechi, in the province of Antioquia, about 248 miles (400 kilometers) north of Bogota. In Panama, rains have caused damage in the provinces of Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui and Colon. The Panamanian Red Cross said in a release Tuesday it is offering aid to about 5,000 people.

Ann Nixon Cooper was born in 1902, a time when women and black people were denied the right to vote. \"I could go and maybe would go, but I'm not looking forward to it,\" says the 106-year-old former socialite. What if Obama came to her house and asked her in person to attend? Cooper perks up and a big smile spreads across her face. \"Oh, yes, of course I'm ready to go!\" It's been a whirlwind ever since Obama mentioned the African-American centenarian in his victory speech Tuesday night. Throngs of media -- from the BBC to a Japanese station to national news outlets -- have descended on her Atlanta house. Strangers have stopped by too. She's taking it all in stride. She stayed up later than usual, until about 3 a.m., after Obama's speech and the phone began ringing off the hook. She had been tipped off by the Obama campaign that he'd say something. \"Somebody told him what to say and what to do and he followed through,\" she says.  Watch \"I'd be proud to meet him as anybody else\" \u00bb . Cooper -- who was born during a time when women and black people couldn't vote -- fully understands the significance of Obama's victory. \"Things are changing, changing, changing, and I look for more change now that it's the first black president in victory of faith over fear,\" she says. \"Don't you know, that's quite something to be proud of.\" What would she tell Obama if she ever meets him? \"I wouldn't have anything special to say about Obama. I enjoyed listening to him, but that's all,\" she says. \"I would be proud to meet him as anyone else.\" She and her late husband, prominent dentist Dr. Albert Cooper, raised four children in her house. The home was a center of Atlanta's black society and the scene of many parties. She knew Martin Luther King Jr. when he was just a boy and was close with his mother. She sometimes refers to Obama as \"that young man.\" In his victory speech, Obama praised Cooper's fight. The president-elect had learned of her story two weeks earlier after CNN profiled her when she went to the polls to vote early. Obama called her soon afterward.  Watch Obama talk about Cooper in his victory speech \u00bb . \"This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations,\" Obama told the tens of thousands of supporters who had gathered in Chicago on Tuesday night. \"But one that's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing -- Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old. \"She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons -- because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin. \"And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America -- the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can.\" Cooper watched Obama's speech from her home. \"Yeah, I knew he was talking about me -- I had been told that he would be saying these things.\"  See images of Cooper's early voting extravaganza \u00bb . She added that her late husband \"would be elated\" a black man will be president. \"Yeah, he'd be so tickled to death,\" she said. \"We looked forward to changes. Everybody looked forward to a better life.\" One of her grandsons, Albert B. Cooper, said the family has been overwhelmed with pride since Tuesday. \"It was a bigger honor than you could ever imagine to be mentioned in Obama's speech. For her to be used as an example of the strength -- and all the changes that have gone on within the black community -- is stunning. We were touched and proud and I can't come up with the words,\" he says. \"It's an amazing thing.\" Ann Cooper has called Atlanta home since the 1920s. She co-founded a Girls Club for African-American youth and taught community residents to read in a tutoring program at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King preached. Celebrities, including the late singer Nat King Cole, often dropped in to visit. One time many years ago, a young student from Morehouse College stopped to visit. He spoke of dreams to become a filmmaker. That man, it turns out, was Spike Lee. \"It's been a house with a heap of living going on in it,\" Cooper said. Born in 1902 in Shelbyville, Tennessee, Cooper danced the electric slide up until the age of 103. She has recently slowed down after suffering several heart attacks and a fractured hip. On a typical day, Cooper spends hours watching television in her wood-paneled sitting room. Her favorite shows are \"The Price is Right,\" \"Oprah\" and \"Dancing with the Stars.\" Three of Cooper's four children have died; her surviving daughter is 83. She has 14 grandchildren living and many great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren. When CNN first interviewed her in October, she said she only had one thing left to see in this world. \"I ain't got time to die 'cause I've got to see a black president,\" she said, giggling with excitement. \"I've got to see that.\" Now, she says, \"I would be very proud if I could just meet and shake his hand.\"", "3d44a33804a7c3afea8e317ee1dd6496932389f2": "(CNN) -- Newspaper front pages around the world were unanimous Wednesday in celebrating the momentousness of Barack Obama's inauguration as U.S. President. Readers browse newspapers Wednesday in the Philippines. \"Let's rebuild America,\" said the front page of France's Le Figaro, over a photograph of a smiling Obama swearing the oath of office. \"The Promise,\" said Liberation, hailing the \"United States of Obama.\" \"Remaking America,\" said the Daily Telegraph in the UK -- a theme carried by many other newspapers worldwide -- while the Daily Mirror preferred: \"Reborn in the USA.\" The Sun showed a picture of Obama's seven-year-old daughter Sasha giving her father the thumbs-up with the headline: \"You're the Daddy.\" \"At last it was the day, the hour, even the second that millions of Americans, \"and not just Americans, have waited for impatiently ever since November, and in many cases for much longer than that. The crowds in Washington were extraordinary evidence of the momentous public potency of the moment,\" the Guardian gushed in its editorial. Many international newspapers focused on the powerful symbolism and unifying power of the arrival of an African-American U.S. president on the world stage. \"We're a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and non-believers,\" said the headline on the front of the Times of India, taking a line from Obama's inaugural address. Japan's Asahi Shimbun said: \"He is expected to play the leading role in changing the world in which racial and religious confrontations continue to rage in defiance of the ideal expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\" \"He is as much symbol as substance, an icon for the youth and a sign of deliverance for an older generation that never believed a man with his skin color would ascend those steps,\" said the International Herald Tribune. But many papers urged Obama to get to work immediately to address the urgent problems already piled up up in his intray. \"This wasn't the occasion for his most soaring of speeches. It was instead an oration rooted in the immediate challenges. It was directed at two audiences: a hopeful but anxious one at home, and an uncertain but hopeful one overseas, the UK's Times said. Speaking of the economic problems on a scale not seen since the Great Depression, China's Xinhua said: \"Like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, Obama, the new president, will get a rare opportunity to leave a sweeping and long-lasting imprint on the U.S. economy.\" The Times of India called on Obama to continue the so-called \"war on terror\" by pursuing Pakistani-based militant groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba which New Delhi blames for last year's terror attacks in Mumbai. \"For the sake of the world's security, Obama must press Islamabad to clamp down on these groups and close down their bases, something that the Bush administration failed to do for most of its run.\" Meanwhile, Germany's Der Spiegel sounded a note of caution about the weight of expectation now resting on Obama's shoulders: \"The catchword of the election campaign was 'change.'The new message to his followers is: 'Be patient.'\" And there was little lament for the passing of the presidency of Obama's controversial predecessor, President George W. Bush. \"He entered the White House promising to heal division by being a 'uniter, not a divider.' He leaves it today as one of the most divisive and least popular presidents in US history,\" the South China Morning Post said. For Obama, according to the UK's Independent, the challenge in office will be to strike a balance between the \"poetry\" of his campaign for election and the tough \"prose\" of government. \"Beautiful rhetoric alone cannot change the world. So perhaps the most encouraging aspect of the address was the new President's willingness to spell out the scale of the problems facing America and the \"hard choices\" that lie ahead for him and the country,\" the paper said. \"An old American aphorism has it that politicians campaign in poetry, but govern in prose. We can be sure that the poetry will continue to flow from an orator as gifted as President Obama. But now begins the difficult task of getting the prose right too.\"", "45256ff2b93cf1e595bea999c3ee61088a86e585": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- He's the man who has just rejected offers of up to $700,000 a week in wages -- but who really is Kaka? And what has he done to deserve so much money? Wanted man: Kaka overcame a spine fracture before getting to the top of world football. Born in Brazil in 1982, Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite, or \"Kaka\" as he is more commonly known, is a footballer with Italian club AC Milan. His name, Kaka, is believed to come from a brother, who began calling him that due to his inability to say his proper name -- Ricardo. Said to be an amazing talent from a very young age, the attacking midfielder began his career with Sao Paulo at the tender age of eight, and had signed his first contract before his 16th birthday. Do you think Kaka should have stayed at AC Milan or taken the money at Manchester City? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. However, when all seemed set for a perfect career, Kaka suffered a serious, potentially paralyzing injury from a swimming pool accident in 2000. The then 18-year-old fractured a vertebra in his spine -- an injury that many thought could have ended his career and even prevented him from walking again. Kaka did recover though, and it's something that the deeply religious Brazilian has put down to the help of God, and ever since has given some of his income to his Church. Once recovered, he didn't waste time in getting his career restarted. By January 2001 he had made his debut in the Sao Paulo senior team and led the team to its first Torneio Rio-Sao Paulo championship. The following year he was a part of the Brazil team which won the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and in 2003 his talents had attracted the interest of European clubs and he signed to AC Milan for euro 9 million ($12 million) per season, and remains under contract with them through 2013. Since then he's won the Serie A, UEFA Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup with AC Milan, while on a personal level he won the 2007 Ballon d'Or Award for the best player in Europe and the FIFA World Player of the Year 2007 -- among many other awards. His international performances have continued to be strong -- and he has now scored 23 goals for Brazil. Such is his influence inside and outside of football, that Kaka was named in the Time 100 most influential people in 2008. Outside of the game Kaka has continued to be a devout Christian. He married his long-time partner Caroline Celico in 2005, and they had their first child in June 2008. Oddly, the current season (in which he finds himself being offered the biggest football salary ever) hasn't been as profitable for Kaka. The 26-year-old has struggled with a groin injury and has not managed to combine as smoothly within the AC Milan team compared to previous seasons. Still, that did not seem to worry Manchester City -- or Real Madrid, and for now at least, the $150 million transfer effort remains the biggest in football's history.", "a8f6508736c136a450a79a10b42545e177a58c28": "Editor's note: The n-word appears in this piece because CNN feels the context in which it is used is pertinent to the story of James \"Little Man\" Presley. James \"Little Man\" Presley has worked in the cotton fields of Sledge, Mississippi, since he was just 6 years old. SLEDGE, Mississippi (CNN) -- James Presley stands amid chopped cotton, the thick Mississippi mud caked on his well-worn boots. A smile spreads across his face when he talks about voting for Barack Obama and what that might mean for generations to come. His voice picks up a notch. He holds his head up a bit higher. \"There's a heap of pride in voting for a black man,\" he says. At 78, Presley is a legend of the past living in the present and now hopeful for the future. A grandson of slaves, he's one of the few men left in America so closely tied to his slave past, still farming cotton on the same land as his ancestors. He's picked cotton since he was just 6 years old. He and his wife of 57 years, Eva May, raised 13 children and six grandchildren in a cypress-sided house in the middle of cotton fields in northwestern Mississippi. He was a sharecropper most his life, but rarely qualified for food stamps.  Watch \"Obama, he come up like\" \u00bb . His father died in 1935 when he was 5, and he had to step up and be the \"Little Man\" of the house, a nickname that has stuck seven decades later. He's lived a raw-knuckled life where hope moved at a molasses-slow pace. The last time he had hope for a better future was four decades ago -- first with President John F. Kennedy and then with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Obama has changed everything to the poor in these parts. iReport.com: What does Obama's presidency mean to you? \"I'm a church man,\" he says. \"And I kind of figured this here is about like it was with Moses with the children of Israel. On that day, when he gets to be president, we're all going to be rejoicing.\" Does he have plans to celebrate on Inauguration Day? \"Oh man, it's gonna be nice. I believe we're gonna have a good time,\" he says. \"I never thought one would get there.\"  See photos of the weather-beaten home where Little Man raised so many children \u00bb . As the nation prepares for Obama's inauguration on January 20, CNN.com traveled to Sledge, Mississippi, a forgotten town of about 500 people in the heart of the Mississippi Delta that some consider to be the birthplace of blues in America. Nearly 20 percent of residents over the age of 60 live below the poverty line, according to the 2000 census. That number nearly doubles, to 37.5 percent, for residents under the age of 19. About three-quarters of the population are black. Two-thirds of the people here make less than $35,000 a year. Presley says the fact the nation will have a black president will have a ripple effect in poor communities like his. For the first time ever, he says, black parents and grandparents can tell youngsters in rural America that through education, anything is possible -- that the White House isn't just for white folks. Three of his children graduated from college. Two have died -- one as a youth, one as an adult. It never gets easier, he says, no matter what age they die. Obama has already brought inspiration to future generations of his own family. \"I might be dead and gone, but it's going to be a good thing to me, because I know that they ain't gotta go through what I went through. They'll have a better time, a more joyous time, than what I had when I come along. It is gonna be grand to them and to me, too.\" \"He knows what it is to come up without a father and what it is to come up for what you work for,\" Presley says. \"Me and the poor man coming up, we had to work for what bread I got.\" Presley shifts back and forth on his feet as he speaks. His flannel shirt and oil-stained jeans seem befitting of his life on the farm. He peers out from a camouflage hat, the fuzzy ear flaps pulled up over his head. He speaks in an accent as thick as the mud on his boots. His hands speak to decades of hard labor. His fingers appear swollen with overworked muscles. The skin seems about a quarter-inch thick. If his hands could speak, he says, \"They'd be crying, instead of talking, for what they've been through.\" \"You see how rusty and rough they are. They've been through something, ain't they?\" At 6-foot, 2-inches and 214 pounds, Presley has what seems an odd nickname. \"They call me Little Man,\" he says. He wears the nickname with pride. The youngest of three sisters and four brothers, he says that after his father died in 1935, he became the \"Little Man\" of the house. \"I was tall, but I was small. So they called me Little Man,\" he says. He doesn't remember much about his father. He can't recall the day he died or the sound of his voice. He was too young. He never met his slave grandparents either. They died long before he was born. But the fact they were slaves still stings. \"That doesn't make you feel too good, you know, to be sold like a cow. But back then, they couldn't help it. So I reckon I'm just glad that things come out better like it is now.\" A thick fog hangs over the fields on this day. Presley pauses. He scans the fields and says, \"I think about the good times and the hard times.\" \"When I started farming, we planted with hands ... and hauled it to the gin by wagon, a mule and a wagon. One bale at a time,\" he says. He worked the fields when he was 6, the age of a typical kindergartner these days. \"I was making 50 cents a day, from sunup to sundown.\" \"Back then, you know, I didn't get no schooling. I had to get out, come home and break the land, cut the stalks, plow the land and get it ready for the crop.\" Presley has a total of four years of education, classes that he took in between growing seasons. His mother taught him to read and write, but he admits even to this day he struggles with both. When it comes to life as a black man -- a sharecropper -- in Mississippi, he says it's tough to explain how difficult it was. He points to a nearby bluff and says that when he was just a boy, a black man was lynched from a tree. \"I never saw him hanging up there,\" he says. \"All I seen was the tree.\" Blacks were segregated from whites. They couldn't go to the same schools. They had separate water fountains. Blacks couldn't go in the front doors of businesses. And just about everywhere you went, he says, racism was rampant. \"You go into a place, and they say, 'Nigger, get outta here.' You don't want nobody telling you that. You're a citizen around town. If you're a citizen, I'm a citizen like you,\" he says. \"It makes you feel mighty bad.\" \"When I was a young boy, they was bad about that, calling you that.\" He registered to vote for the first time in 1959 and cast his first presidential ballot for Kennedy. He says he's voted in every presidential election ever since. \"We felt like we were moving on up when we voted for him,\" he says. When Kennedy was assassinated, \"everybody was kind of sad on that day, because he looked like the first president that had come in and was trying to help the poor folks.\" King brought hope, too. \"He was the only hope that we were looking for -- to bring us out,\" Presley says. But when King was killed on April 4, 1968, he says, it \"put us right back where we was.\" \"It was pitiful that day,\" he says. \"Everybody around here was in mourning.\" He says Obama has brought inspiration to blacks in these parts, the likes of which hasn't been seen since 1968. \"With Obama coming in, it's gonna be another Martin Luther King helping us,\" he says. \"Maybe in the next 40 years, we'll be better off.\" He says Americans should never take their voting rights for granted. He was 30 years old before he first voted. \"It means a lot to me, because I can put in for who I want to be president and who not to be president,\" he says. \"So I just feel proud that I can vote.\" Before parting on this day, Presley gives a tour of the weather-beaten, four-bedroom house where he raised his 13 children and six grandkids. The wood-framed house was the first home he ever lived in with running water, a bathroom and electric stove. The now-abandoned house is dilapidated, many of its windows broken, its doors barely hanging on hinges. \"I've had a good life, despite the hard times. I sure did,\" says Presley, who is retiring after 72 years of working the fields. What's his message to the world? \"The important thing in life is to try to live and do the best you can,\" he says. \"We done had it bad. Let us help give our children a better life, our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren. Let's try to give them a better life than we had. But anyway, just keep the good work going, is all I say.\"", "33fe4319881cf2ebc225ad0e0914429a6fdf3175": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A child cries from hunger, but no tears come from her swollen eyes. A Zimbabwean family bury their relative, who died of cholera, 25km from Harare, Zimbabwe. Malnutrition has left this baby born in Zimbabwe fighting for her life. She is the face of an unfolding crisis in a country once known as Africa's bread basket. Today a loaf of bread costs $35 million worthless Zimbabwean dollars, and people are forced to sift through garbage piles for any morsel of food. Others huddle for warmth around a fire burning inside the shell of a broken-down van. All of these images were captured on video recently smuggled out of Zimbabwe by Solidarity Peace Trust, a South African human rights group.  Watch the disturbing images \u00bb . Zimbabwe's government maintains that the situation is being exaggerated by the West in an effort to exert pressure on President Robert Mugabe to leave office. But the World Health Organization (WHO) says the desperate situation has triggered a widening cholera outbreak that has killed 775 people and infected more than 15,000. \"You have to eat in the same place you sleep right next to the buckets, the same buckets that we used as toilets,\" one cholera patient says on the video. \"There is no water to bathe.\" And little to eat. Women foraging for food in the bush find dry branches with only a few berries. \"This packet of juice will be my supper tonight,\" one woman says. Zimbabwe's main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai -- who is still trying to form a unity government with Mugabe under a recent power-sharing deal -- said the situation can only be addressed once a \"legitimate government\" is in place. \"Once there is a legitimate government, it is up to that government to deal with the problems the country is facing, which are quite wide-ranging,\" Tsvangirai told CNN on Wednesday. \"But the immediate intervention of the health crisis has exacerbated the situation to the extent that it has now become an international crisis.\" The WHO says the current cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe has a high fatality rate because sufferers are either not able to reach health centers in time or that the health centers lack the capacity to treat the cases. \"The epidemic is clearly on the increase,\" Dr. Eric Laroche, a WHO official in Harare, told CNN on Wednesday. \"I think it's going to last for several months.\" In addition to the WHO, the Red Cross has responded to the outbreak and is sending staff and medical supplies into Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's main hospitals have all but shut down and the small clinics equipped by international aid organizations are overcrowded and unable to cope with the thousands of cholera patients. Health workers inside Zimbabwe believe scores are dying at home. Laroche said the WHO is receiving cooperation from the government, but the health care system is abysmal. \"The quality of the care, the supplies that come inside Zimbabwe, also need to be restored,\" Laroche said. \"So there's a lot of work to do, because the health system is collapsing for the time being.\" One Zimbabwean health care worker, who would not show his face on the video, said he fears the death toll will skyrocket. \"People are dying even at the health institution,\" he said. \"It's beyond control. We are going to witness so many deaths in the coming weeks.\" He expressed frustration that so many people are dying from cholera, a disease that \"is both preventable and curable.\" \"Nobody should die from cholera,\" he said. \"We are quite unfortunate.\" Zimbabwe, already experiencing an economic crisis, was struck with the raging water-borne cholera in August. Health experts say the battle against the disease can only be won if Harare has adequate water-treating chemicals and disposes of refuse properly. Zimbabwe's information minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said Tuesday that the country has enough chemicals to purify water and enough money to buy pipes to mend sanitation lines. He maintained that the outbreak is under control, blaming the West for causing the crisis as an excuse for military intervention. International leaders -- including U.S. President George W. Bush, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Kenyan premier Raila Odinga -- have recently called for Mugabe to step down for failing to contain the cholera outbreak. Frustration inside Zimbabwe is building. Last week, doctors and nurses protested over the lack of medical supplies and other resources at the country's hospitals. Labor unions have protested over the deteriorating economy. Even soldiers once shielded from economic hardships by the Mugabe regime went on a rampage last week when they were unable to access wages from the country's banks. Human rights activist Elinor Sisulu, who has lived and worked in Zimbabwe and now coordinates civil action outside the country, called on African leaders to demand Mugabe step down before Zimbabwe explodes. \"In any population where you have high levels of desperation, anger and ... people arrive at the conclusion that we've tried a peaceful political process and this is not working, then anything can happen,\" she said. -- CNN's Nkepile Mabuse in Johannesburg, South Africa contributed to this report.", "b4a18030df64c45d6cc6ee2eea097e2acb962755": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Troubled pop star Amy Winehouse spent the night in a London hospital after suffering a reaction to a medication she was taking at home Monday night, according to her spokeswoman. Amy Winehouse's husband was recently jailed for 27 months. Tracey Miller said she could not say what medication was involved. A statement from University College Hospital said Winehouse had been kept in overnight for observation. She had a comfortable night and was released Tuesday morning, the statement said. London Ambulance Service said it transported the singer after being notified of \"an adult female taken unwell.\" Winehouse's spokesman in London, Chris Goodman, told the British Press Association that he had not been told what was wrong with the 24-year-old singer, who is well known for her song \"Rehab,\" describing the singer's reluctance to enter a clinic. The pop singer was investigated this year after a London tabloid made public a leaked home video that showed her smoking something in a glass pipe minutes after she was heard saying she had just taken six tablets of the anti-anxiety drug Valium. Police declined to file charges. The singer has battled drug addiction and spent about two weeks in a rehabilitation clinic in January. Winehouse won five Grammy awards this year -- three for \"Rehab\" as well as Album of the Year and Best New Artist.

A medical helicopter landed near Forrest City, Arkansas, on Saturday after striking a bird. The chopper's pilot made a \"safe landing\" in that state after hitting a bird while returning to Baptist Health Center in Little Rock, Arkansas, hospital spokesman Mark Lowman said. \"I think the pilot just made a judgment call to set it down,\" Lowman said of the landing, which happened at 6:15 p.m. Saturday near Forrest City, Arkansas. Video footage taken by CNN affiliate WREG showed a bird hanging out of a hole torn into the paneling on the chopper's nose. Part of the helicopter's windshield also was broken. The pilot was slightly injured during the landing, and the other two crew members on board were uninjured, Lowman said. Federal aviation officials are investigating, and the helicopter is not expected to be grounded for long, he said. The helicopter was returning from a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, where the crew had taken a patient. The incident came two days after a US Airways jetliner was forced to land in New York's Hudson River, apparently after striking a flock of birds. Shortly after the jet took off from New York's LaGuardia airport on Thursday, the crew reported seeing a flock of birds. Seconds later, the cockpit voice recorder captured the sounds of loud \"thumps\" and both of the plane's engines failed.

On his long-running syndicated talk show, he debated issues including abortion and the death penalty, and his MSNBC show was canceled in 2003, he maintained, because of his antiwar stand. Phil Donahue, right, made \"Body of War\" about disabled veteran Tomas Young, seated. Now the former talk show host has co-directed and co-produced an independent film, \"Body of War,\" about a disabled Iraq war veteran, Tomas Young, who questions the conflict's rationale. Young joined the military after the September 11 attacks and was sent to Iraq. After less than a week there, he was shot in the spine, paralyzing him from the waist down. \"Body of War\" is the story of his coming home and adjusting to his new reality. The film has earned excellent reviews and was named best documentary of 2007 by the National Board of Review. It airs on The Sundance Channel on Tuesday night.

In the middle of the most sanitized war of my lifetime, nobody sees this pain. These people are all below the radar. What you see in our film is a drama taking place behind the closed doors of thousands of homes in this country.

We're going to show a clip right now. (Begin video clip) Tomas Young: When I made the phone call on September 13, it was because I saw the pictures of [President Bush] standing on top of the pile, saying that we were going to smoke the evildoers out that did this to us.

She was the campaign manager for the Al Gore-Joe Lieberman ticket in 2000 and wrote \"Cooking with Grease.\" Donna Brazile says Barack Obama's inauguration is a huge milestone in the fight for equal rights . WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Today Barack Obama will be sworn in as the 44th president of the United States of America. This is the day for which so many prayed, so many marched and so many more sacrificed. This is a day of jubilation and celebration. This is the day to rejoice and recommit ourselves to restoring the American dream for us all. Barack Obama's election offers our country the opportunity to open a new chapter that will allow us to turn the corner on past prejudices and racial politics. When Sen. Obama announced his candidacy for president in 2007, most people, black and white, thought it would be, at best, an interesting sideshow. After Obama's victories in the early primaries, there came the controversial videos of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, broadcasting a racial divisiveness that cast even greater doubt on an Obama candidacy. But the senator moved quickly to reassure people that Wright's jaundiced view of America did not reflect his own. Americans wanted to move beyond racial categorization and the politics of division. Obama understood that. And so did the voters. But African-Americans didn't believe it. Seventy-one percent of black voters had never thought a black candidate for president would get elected in their lifetime, according to a national poll released in November by CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Yet 59 percent of white respondents said they had thought it was possible. Obama did not just win the caucuses in Iowa  -- a state with a white population of more than 94 percent -- he resoundingly captured it. Other primary victories, once thought improbable, soon followed. These included Georgia, and Virginia, the former seat of the Confederacy. On Election Day, Obama won a higher percentage of the white vote than John Kerry did in 2004, though he did not get a majority of whites. Unlike other black presidential candidates before him, Obama did not run as \"the black candidate.\" He ran as a Democratic candidate, a U.S. senator from Illinois, and a progressive. And America, by larger margins than in previous recent elections, voted for the progressive Democratic U.S. senator from Illinois who happened to be biracial. For too long, race has been the stain on the American fabric. As Secretary Condoleezza Rice reminded us, race has been our \"nation's birth defect.\" At times during the long primary and general election, race became a subtle distraction -- but the American people rejected it and it was never the primary issue. Nor was it the primary issue for Americans who voted for Barack Obama. The vast majority of those who voted for and against Obama did so based on the content of his political prescriptions and platform -- not the color of his skin. A lot of lessons were taught November 4. Obama's election revealed the possibility of three new truths for African-Americans: White America may not be as racist as African-Americans thought they were; a solution to our country's lingering racial problem may eventually be found; and the Rev. Martin Luther King's dream that one day all people will be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin is alive and within reach. Obama's election has inspired 6 in 10 blacks to forecast better race relations in the United States. \"A majority of blacks now believe that a solution to the country's racial problems will eventually be found,\" said CNN polling director Keating Holland. \"In every previous poll on this topic dating back to 1993, black respondents had always said that racial problems were a permanent part of the American landscape. Even in the most recent polls taken last week, a majority of African-Americans said that a solution to the country's racial problems could be within reach; now blacks and whites agree that racial tensions may end.\" Yes, of course, racism still exists in America. But if a black man can become president of the United States of America, then aren't all Americans now free to believe they can achieve any goal they set for themselves? So on this day, let us all rejoice and be glad. Let us celebrate this moment in American history and let us resolve to find common ground. Let us resolve to join together as a nation to ensure that racial prejudice in America, as well as an ethic of non-achievement based on excuses and low expectations, dies the same death it did in the November ballot box. What our founders envisioned -- what President Lincoln and the Rev. King fought and died for, we are perhaps finally ready to achieve. This is a remarkable moment. Though not the apex we need to reach, it is still a mountaintop, alive with possibilities, a dream no longer deferred.

Some people will cross the Potomac River via water taxi on Inauguration Day. Working closely with the United States Coast Guard, the Potomac Riverboat Company, based in Alexandria, Virginia, plans to ferry up to 3,200 passengers from across the frigid Potomac on seven climate-controlled boats. The service is partially a response to the closure of all bridges from Virginia to D.C. on Inauguration Day, a measure that prompted an uproar among Virginia residents. According to maritime authorities in charge of the region, PRC is the only company being allowed to taxi across the river on the 20th. \"Because the taxi service provided us with a security plan that we examined and deemed adequate to provide good security, I granted them a waiver to operate at an increased security level,\" National Capitol Region Port Captain Brian Kelley says. \"The taxis are going to operate on a strict schedule and a strict route.\" The Coast Guard established a temporary security zone on waterways in the National Capitol Region, stepping up restrictions day-by-day leading up to 11 p.m. on January 19. At that point, all vessels must be docked and only boats with an approved sail plan will be allowed to operate. John Lake, a ship captain and the general manager of the company, said the sail plan he submitted was approved only a week ago and details nearly every move taxis will make. \"All the departures are scheduled times. And those departures are supposed to leave on-time,\" Lake said. \"We have to call in on each departure to the Coast Guard, let them know we're preparing to get under way, and get the permission, basically, to get under way.\" The boats depart the Alexandria Marina for the 40-minute trip beginning around 6 a.m. and must be docked on the southwest D.C. shore by 10 a.m. From there, it's a cold, mile-long walk to the Mall, so Lake has some advice for passengers. \"Show up early to get through the security check and dress warm,\" he said. \"It's going to be nice and toasty on the boat, but not so much outside.\" Return trips, tentatively scheduled for around 6 p.m., are not allowed to depart D.C. until after the inaugural parade events have concluded and President Obama is secured. In keeping with the Coast Guard's security measures, Lake says all passengers must arrive at least an hour early for a full screening. Passengers that want to stay in D.C. after the early evening departures will have to find other transport back across the Potomac.

Prince Harry takes part in a memorial parade and service for troops killed during his tour of Afghanistan. Harry, 23, serves in the British Army and spent 10 weeks in Afghanistan earlier this year. He was withdrawn unexpectedly in March after news leaked out about his low-key deployment. The prince appeared in uniform alongside around 200 other sailors, soldiers, marines and airmen at the parade, which took place on Edinburgh's famous Royal Mile. They made their way to St. Giles' Cathedral for a private memorial and thanksgiving service for the fallen service members. Also attending the service was British Defense Secretary Des Browne, families of the fallen troops, and recovering wounded military personnel. Harry holds the rank of cornet, equivalent to a second lieutenant. He was deployed to Afghanistan's Helmand province where he served as a forward air controller. His duties included calling in airstrikes and air support when necessary, guaranteeing the accuracy of bombing on the ground and guarding against incidents of friendly fire. The parade and memorial service took place on the same day Britain's Ministry of Defense announced the deaths of four British soldiers in Afghanistan, and two days after Browne announced Britain will increase its presence in Afghanistan from 7,800 troops to 8,030 by next spring.

Brands is the author of \"TR: The Last Romantic\" and the just-released \"Traitor to His Class: The Privileged Life and Radical Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\" He teaches history at the University of Texas at Austin. Historian H.W. Brands says power as well as race was behind controversy over Booker T. Washington. AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- In his concession speech on Tuesday night, John McCain illustrated the historic significance of Barack Obama's election by noting that a little over a century ago the inclusion of another black man, Booker T. Washington, at a White House dinner provoked outrage in large parts of the country. McCain wasn't giving a history lecture, and he quickly moved on, but the tale is worth exploring, as it is both more complex and more instructive than McCain's brief remarks suggested. Washington was the one who initiated the acquaintance that led to his 1901 dinner with Theodore Roosevelt. Washington had built the Tuskegee Institute of Alabama into a political base that made him the most powerful black leader in the country. Invited to address the Cotton States Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1895, Washington offered white America a racial bargain: Blacks would cease agitating for immediate political and civil rights if whites would fund black educational and economic advancement. This \"Atlanta Compromise\" outraged black intellectuals like W. E. B. Du Bois, but it appealed to white leaders in the South and white philanthropists in the North -- and it marked Washington, the broker of Northern largesse and Southern cooperation, as one of the shrewdest politicians in the South. Washington spotted Roosevelt on the rise, and after Roosevelt became vice president, Washington invited him to Tuskegee, where he knew Roosevelt, the apostle of the strenuous life, would be entranced by the rigorous physical regimen the students pursued. Roosevelt was preparing to visit Tuskegee when the assassination of William McKinley elevated him to the presidency and threw his plans into turmoil. Roosevelt instead invited Washington to call at the White House whenever he was in town. Washington didn't have to be asked twice. Within weeks, he was in the capital and was invited to join the president for dinner on October 16. Roosevelt's ascension to the presidency made him that much more interesting to Washington. Yet no more interesting than Washington was to Roosevelt. The peculiar politics of the Republican Party gave Washington an importance among Republicans that belied the abnegations of the Atlanta Compromise. Discriminatory Jim Crow laws kept most blacks from voting in the South, but they didn't prevent the Southern states from sending delegations to the Republican national conventions every four years. These delegations could tip the balance in a tight contest, and Roosevelt -- who though president was profoundly unpopular among the Republican bosses -- expected the 1904 convention to be a tight contest. Roosevelt's invitation to Washington to dine at the White House had little to do with Washington's race per se, but everything to do with Washington's role as a political boss of Southern Republicans who happened to be black. Likewise, the outrage expressed by Southern editors and spokesmen over Roosevelt's alleged affront to the South, while couched in the language of race, was really about political power. \"White men of the South, how do you like it?\" fulminated the New Orleans Times-Democrat. \"White women of the South, how do you like it?\" The Richmond Times frothed over the implications of the honor Roosevelt had bestowed on Washington: \"It means that the president is willing that Negroes shall mingle freely with whites in the social circle -- that white women may receive attentions from negro men; it means that there is no racial reason in his opinion why whites and blacks may not marry and intermarry, why the Anglo-Saxon may not mix negro blood with his blood.\" The vehemence of the Southern response gave the game away. Booker Washington had explicitly forsworn any claim to social equality, let alone the right for blacks to marry whites. What the Southern foamers, political conservatives to a man, feared was that Washington might help the dangerously progressive Roosevelt get elected in his own right. When he did precisely that -- Roosevelt fended off the conservatives at the 1904 convention and was returned to office overwhelmingly -- they foamed the more. The race question in America has often been about race, but it has equally often been about power. Not for 40 years, since the dismantling of the Jim Crow system, has the race of guests at the White House prompted anything other than idle curiosity. But until last Tuesday those African-Americans among the guests were precisely that: guests -- visitors who lacked the power that occupancy of the White House entails. Symbolism isn't unimportant, and the symbolism of a black man taking the oath of the president's office in January will certainly bring an outpouring of sentiment like that which greeted Obama's election. But behind the symbolism of race is the reality of power. Obama will wield power of an order Booker Washington appreciated in Roosevelt but never possessed for himself. A week or a month after the symbolism fades, the reality will remain. At that point, Obama's race won't matter nearly as much as his facility with power.

British troops talk in Basra last week. Iraq on Sunday OK'd foreign troops to remain in the country after the new year. It was the last step for final adoption of the resolution, which won parliamentary approval Tuesday. Iraq's main political parties hammered out the resolution a week ago, after an impasse among parliamentary factions threatened to continue beyond the December 31 deadline. A separate, previously approved agreement authorizes U.S. troops to remain. Britain has about 4,100 troops in Iraq, the second-largest contingent after the United States, which has about 142,500. Other countries covered under the resolution -- El Salvador, Australia, Romania and Estonia -- have a total of several hundred troops in the country. The resolution authorizes Iraq to negotiate bilateral agreements with the countries, Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman said. If it had not been approved by year's end, their troops would have been in Iraq illegally. In November, the United States concluded a separate agreement with the Iraqi government authorizing the continued presence of its troops. U.S. combat forces plan to pull back from population centers in Iraq by July and to withdraw from Iraq by the end of 2011.

Italian police examine a sewer that may have offered an escape route for a suspected mafia boss. Giuseppe Setola, 38, was arrested near Caserta north of Naples, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency and reports in the La Repubblica and Corriere Della Sera newspapers. \"This is a great moment for the (Italian) state,\" Naples anti-Mafia prosecutor Franco Roberti told ANSA after Setola's arrest. \"We were certain (Setola) was in a situation of great difficulty. We promised all the citizens that he would be caught. We have kept that promise.\" Setola is believed to have slipped into a tunnel built under his hideout near Naples on Monday, as police closed in on him, according to the reports. That tunnel connects to the sewer system in Caserta. Corriere published photos of anti-mafia police searching through what was described as Setola's trash-strewn bunker and the tunnel. Anti-mafia police have been searching for Setola for months, and had already arrested his wife and two suspected members of his crew, according to the reports. Monday was the third time he avoided arrest. Setola is allegedly the head of a killing team run by the powerful Casalesi clan which belongs to the Neapolitan mafia known as Camorra. He got out of jail last spring after a doctor ruled that he was legally blind. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into that ruling. Corriere published a photo of Setola wearing sunglasses with his left eye bandaged. The Casalesi clan is featured in the best-selling book \"Gomorrah\" -- a play on the word \"Camorra\" -- written by Roberto Saviano who now lives under constant police protection. Saviano recently said he may have to leave Italy to escape constant death threats from the mafia and its supporters. Police began cracking down on Setola and his colleagues after the murder of six West African immigrants in the nearby town of Castel Volturno in September. After those killings, the Italian government activated the army to help bolster efforts against the Casalesi clan, which is believed to have killed more than 20 people since May. The two suspected members of his squad have given police information about his movements. In November, police arrested an Italian police officer suspected of informing Setola about police operations.", "c1bb8e9900e2da0a2dace45b697ec9f1c08c8614": "(CNN) -- A new study that surveyed racial attitudes suggests that racial prejudices could tip the balance in the upcoming presidential election. A poll finds a small percentage of voters said they may turn away from Sen. Barack Obama because of his race. If there were no racial prejudice among voters, Sen. Barack Obama would receive about 6 percentage points more support, according to an AP-Yahoo News poll, designed in partnership with Stanford University. The results suggest that 40 percent of white Americans hold at least a partly negative view toward blacks, including more than a third of white Democrats and independents. A small percentage of voters -- 2.5 percent of those surveyed -- said they may turn away from Obama because of his race. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey also indicates that race could play a big role in November. Asked if race would be a factor in their vote, 37 percent of respondents said yes. But of that group, many are Republicans who are not likely to vote for any Democrat, and some are Democrats who may vote for Obama because of his race. Of the 8 percent of Democrats who told CNN they plan to vote for Obama's GOP rival, Sen. John McCain, half said race was a factor. The survey, conducted August 29-31, questioned 1,031 people and has a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Experts point out that it's hard to quantify racial prejudice because many people who hold prejudices are not going to admit to it.  Watch how race could affect the election \u00bb . \"The hardest thing in the world for pollsters to poll for, with the exception of sexual behavior, is racial attitudes and how it affects behavior,\" said Walter Shapiro, Washington bureau chief for Salon.com. Shapiro said while people might say things differently off the record, racial issues cannot easily be quantified. The pollsters for the AP/Yahoo survey used techniques that they thought would be more likely to lead to honest results -- such as conducting the poll online and using subtle methods and formulas to calculate racial attitudes. That study also suggests that the number of people who may turn away from Obama because of his race could be larger than what the margin of victory was in the 2004 election. Jeff Johnson, host of BET's \"The Truth With Jeff Johnson,\" said, \"I think there is a concern clearly about the number of people who will vote based on race. \"But I agree -- how you quantify that number, I think, is very difficult.\" According to CNN's average of recent national polls, Obama holds a lead of 5 percentage points over  McCain. Johnson said one misconception is that racial prejudices are unique to conservatives or people in \"Middle America.\" \"There are liberals also in many cases that are racist. I don't think we know yet how it's going to play out,\" he said. In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Obama said while some people might not vote for him because he is black, others might vote for him just because he is. \"Are there going to be some people who don't vote for me because I'm black? Of course. There are probably some African-Americans who are voting for me because I'm black or maybe others just inspired by the idea of breaking new ground, and so I think all that's a wash,\" he said. Democrats, however, typically get close to 90 percent of the African-American vote anyway. Salon.com's Shapiro said Democrats can work on increasing turnout among black voters but that it will be hard to make gains on the percentages they already see. Johnson said he thinks race will matter, and the best way for Obama to balance out any negative effect is to just stay on message. \"I don't know if I believe it's going to be a wash. I think it's going to matter. This race is extremely close, and so every single demographic and every single point is going to count,\" he said. \"I think he has to speak to the issues of people in Middle America, and by that, it can counterbalance some of these racial issues.\" The AP-Yahoo News poll surveyed 2,227 adults.

Firefighters work to put out a fire at a town home Friday night in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Six of the victims -- three adults, a teen and two children -- were found in the townhome's basement, huddled together, Philadelphia Fire Commissioner Lloyd Ayers said. A 2-year-old boy who was pulled from the burning house by firefighters was later pronounced dead at Children's Hospital, Ayers said. Eleven people, all of Liberian nationality, lived in the basement of the home, he said. Two were rescued by firefighters and two escaped on their own, Ayers said.

In the 1970s, Freddie Hubbard made a series of funk- and fusion-oriented albums, such as the 1970 hit \"Red Clay.\" Hubbard died Monday morning in Sherman Oaks, California, outside Los Angeles, after a long battle with heart disease, spokesman Don Lucoff told CNN. He had been hospitalized since suffering a heart attack the day before Thanksgiving and took a turn for the worse last week, Lucoff said. \"Freddie Hubbard, in terms of the advent of modern jazz, the birth of bebop, was probably among the five greatest trumpet players that has ever lived ... He's really right up there with Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Lee Morgan, Roy Eldridge, an innovator and great composer,\" Lucoff said. A native of Indianapolis, Indiana, Hubbard moved to New York in the late 1950s. By the mid-1960s, he was playing alongside such major jazz figures as Art Blakey, Oliver Nelson, Ornette Coleman, Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter. In the early 1970s, he made a series of funk- and fusion-oriented albums, such as the 1970 hit \"Red Clay\" and 1972's Grammy-winning \"First Light.\" \"The thing that set Freddie Hubbard apart was he played rapidly, he played soulfully and he really set the pace for a lot of the trumpet players who have come after him in the last 20 or 30 years,\" Lucoff said.

Russert was born May 7, 1950, in Buffalo, New York. His parents were Timothy John Russert Sr., or \"Big Russ,\" a newspaper truck driver and sanitation worker, and Elizabeth Russert. Buffalo Mayor Byron W. Brown ordered that all flags on city property be lowered immediately to half-staff in Russert's honor. He was a graduate of Canisius High School, John Carroll University and the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. He was a member of the bar in New York and the District of Columbia, according to a biography on CNBC.com . Before joining NBC, Russert served as press secretary for former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and as chief of staff to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Russert joined the network in 1984 and quickly established himself as the face of the network's political coverage, eventually becoming senior vice president and Washington bureau chief of NBC news. His career at NBC was marked by a number of milestones. In 1985, Russert supervised live broadcasts of the \"Today\" show from Rome, Italy, negotiating an appearance by Pope John Paul II -- a first for American television. He was also the recipient of numerous awards for his work, including an Emmy in 2005 for his coverage of the funeral of President Ronald Reagan. His rise to prominence coincided with his success as the best-selling author of two books, 2004's \"Big Russ and Me\" and 2006's \"Wisdom of Our Fathers,\" which documented his journey from blue-collar beginnings to law school to Washington powerhouse.

Walking backwards to school, for a mile in the snow, grounds you for life,\" Russert told the Washington Post's Howard Kurtz in 2004. \"Plus, if you have a family the way I do, it's a daily reality check.\" Russert, who also served as a political analyst for cable network MSNBC, took the helm of \"Meet the Press\" in 1991, turning the long-running Sunday-morning interview program into the most-watched show of its kind in the United States. During his 17-year run as the host of \"Meet the Press,\" the longest of any host in the show's 60-year history, Russert earned the respect and admiration of many journalists and politicians. \"He was an institution in both news and politics for more than two decades. Tim was a tough and hardworking newsman. He was always well-informed and thorough in his interviews. And he was as gregarious off the set as he was prepared on it,\" President Bush said Friday.

Here, CNN Anchor Rick Sanchez describes spending some time with day laborers for a report that will air on 'Out in the Open' tonight at 8 ET. CNN's Rick Sanchez, pictured center, visits a street corner where many people gather to seek manual labor jobs. PALISADES PARK, New Jersey (CNN) -- For four hours Friday morning, I joined about 200 immigrants -- legal and illegal -- at a day-laborer site at the corner of East Columbia Avenue and Broad Avenue in downtown Palisades Park, New Jersey. My goal was not to find a job; rather it was to see how day laborers go about finding one themselves. Dressed in jeans, running shoes and a short-sleeve shirt, I looked like one of them. I also carried over my shoulder a bag containing a hidden camera. Day laborer sites like this one have sprung up all over the country. The laborers -- mostly immigrants, mostly men -- come to them to find jobs in construction or masonry or painting or landscaping. Some communities encourage the formation of these sites. In others, they have become lightning rods of controversy. In Palisades Park, they have become fixtures. At the site I visited, the last thing the folks there needed was more competition for jobs, but they nonetheless welcomed me into their group. They gave me pointers about how to get a good job. \"Always ask how much,\" one man told me in Spanish as he prepped me in the art of negotiating for a days' wage. Another said it's better to be paid by the day instead of the hour. That way you're assured of a decent payment even if the work is cut short or the job is finished early. The guys I met told me they come here seven days a week. They wait and wait and wait for work. \"Sometimes there's no work, sometimes there is work. Not every day,\" one man said. It gets worse when winter comes. \"When it's cold, there's no work,\" another told me. A good week, they said, is one where they get offered jobs on two days for about $90 a day. That's a weekly salary of $180. It's barely enough to put food on the table, but it's better than the alternative. Life in Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, they said, offers little in the way of income -- about $5 a week for manual labor. \"We don't have a choice but to try to save a little bit and go back to our country,\" a 23-year-old Guatemalan man told me. The routine is simple: Show up early and wait for hours until a prospective employer shows up, if one shows up. As more people flock to these sites the competition for jobs gets intense. \"There are a lot of people ... and I mean a lot of people at the stop here. So you no longer get a lot of work,\" the Guatemalan said. On Friday, I was there for 3\u00bd hours until I finally witnessed a job offer. It came from, ironically, another immigrant. He was from the Ivory Coast, Africa, new in America himself, and delighted to provide work for fellow immigrants. He was looking for someone to help him move furniture and other belongings. These immigrants -- the African with a job and the Latinos seeking work -- negotiated the job terms in broken English, with African and Spanish accents swirling in the air. \"I need two,\" said the African employer referring to the number of workers. \"Two dollars is not enough,\" responded the Guatemalan. After much arm waving and false starts, they eventually figured out what the other was saying and a deal was struck. Many of the men here have a love-hate relationship with the United States. They miss their home countries but feel compelled to stay here out of economic necessity. \"All you get in this country is bitterness, sadness and loneliness,\" one man told me. \"But money,\" I interjected. \"Of course, that's true,\" he responded. \"First place is ... the money, that's why we come.\" E-mail to a friend .

The mayor, a billionaire businessman, is credited with helping New York City recover economically after the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, which felled the twin towers of the World Trade Center and killed more than 2,700 people. Elected for the first time just two months after the attacks, Bloomberg pumped tens of millions of dollars of his own money into that campaign, as well as his bid for re-election in 2005. \"As a businessman with expertise on Wall Street and finance and as a mayor who has balanced budgets and delivered services, I can tell you that the enormity of the challenges ahead should not be underestimated,\" Bloomberg said. \"I care deeply about sustaining the progress we made and finishing the job the voters elected me to do.\"  Watch Bloomberg talk about seeking a third term \u00bb . New York City Comptroller William C. Thompson, Jr., a Democrat considered a leading candidate to replace Bloomberg in next year's election, said he was \"extremely disappointed\" in the mayor's announcement. \"I have always taken the Mayor at his word, particularly when he said on multiple occasions that altering term limits through a council vote would be disgraceful,\" he said. \"Let me be clear: Today's announcement constitutes an attempt to suspend democracy. We should not undermine the will of the voters.\" Bloomberg, an independent since 2007, wants city council to change the current two-term limit law and offer voters another choice. \"As always, it will be up to the people to decide, not me,\" he said. Standing beside Bloomberg at a later news conference regarding rebuilding at the World Trade Center site, New York Gov. David Paterson said he'd \"be delighted to see [Bloomberg] running for a third term.\" The mayor then jokingly pledged that he would not seek a fourth. In 2005, Bloomberg easily defeated his Democratic opponent, Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, who was never able to gain any traction against the popular incumbent.

And what has he done to deserve so much money? Wanted man: Kaka overcame a spine fracture before getting to the top of world football. Born in Brazil in 1982, Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite, or \"Kaka\" as he is more commonly known, is a footballer with Italian club AC Milan. His name, Kaka, is believed to come from a brother, who began calling him that due to his inability to say his proper name -- Ricardo. Said to be an amazing talent from a very young age, the attacking midfielder began his career with Sao Paulo at the tender age of eight, and had signed his first contract before his 16th birthday. Do you think Kaka should have stayed at AC Milan or taken the money at Manchester City? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. However, when all seemed set for a perfect career, Kaka suffered a serious, potentially paralyzing injury from a swimming pool accident in 2000. The then 18-year-old fractured a vertebra in his spine -- an injury that many thought could have ended his career and even prevented him from walking again. Kaka did recover though, and it's something that the deeply religious Brazilian has put down to the help of God, and ever since has given some of his income to his Church. Once recovered, he didn't waste time in getting his career restarted. By January 2001 he had made his debut in the Sao Paulo senior team and led the team to its first Torneio Rio-Sao Paulo championship. The following year he was a part of the Brazil team which won the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and in 2003 his talents had attracted the interest of European clubs and he signed to AC Milan for euro 9 million ($12 million) per season, and remains under contract with them through 2013. Since then he's won the Serie A, UEFA Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup with AC Milan, while on a personal level he won the 2007 Ballon d'Or Award for the best player in Europe and the FIFA World Player of the Year 2007 -- among many other awards. His international performances have continued to be strong -- and he has now scored 23 goals for Brazil. Such is his influence inside and outside of football, that Kaka was named in the Time 100 most influential people in 2008. Outside of the game Kaka has continued to be a devout Christian. He married his long-time partner Caroline Celico in 2005, and they had their first child in June 2008. Oddly, the current season (in which he finds himself being offered the biggest football salary ever) hasn't been as profitable for Kaka. The 26-year-old has struggled with a groin injury and has not managed to combine as smoothly within the AC Milan team compared to previous seasons. Still, that did not seem to worry Manchester City -- or Real Madrid, and for now at least, the $150 million transfer effort remains the biggest in football's history.", "2840f926c864b1d8e2056df3c0bfdccc04da3106": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Three bombings killed an Iraqi official and three police officers and wounded 14 other Iraqis on Sunday evening and Monday morning, according to an official with the Iraqi Interior Ministry.

Pardo rigged his rental car so that if someone tried to remove the Santa suit, the car would explode. During a news conference on Friday, Covina Police Chief Kim Raney said Bruce Jeffrey Pardo had purchased a ticket for an early Christmas Day flight from Los Angeles to Canada. Raney said that while police do not know why Pardo, 45, decided against his plan to flee, they speculate it may have been due to the burn injuries Pardo received after setting fire to the home where the slayings occurred. Pardo's body was covered in third-degree burns, Raney said, and part of the Santa suit the gunman wore to the massacre burned and melted into his legs. Police believe Pardo's injuries came after he set fire to the home using a homemade device used to spread fuel. Raney also said Pardo came to his former in-laws' home with $17,000 strapped to his legs and inside a girdle, indicating he may have wanted quick access to his money as he fled the country.  Watch police talk about what was found on the gunman's body \u00bb . Police said that after leaving the home, Pardo changed out of the Santa suit and into regular clothes. Raney also spoke about a pipe bomb that exploded in Pardo's rental car Thursday night. He said Pardo had rigged the rental car so that if someone tried to remove the Santa suit, the car would explode. The car was packed with ammunition and black powder, he said. Police said that inside Pardo's home in Montrose, California, they also found five empty boxes for semiautomatic handguns, two high-powered shotguns and \"racing fuel,\" which they believe was used to help set fire to the home. Police also said they found Pardo's resume, which said he had a bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering, but they could not verify if it was accurate. The resume also indicated Pardo had worked in the aerospace field. The news conference Friday came after officials said a ninth body was found in the rubble at the home.  Watch investigators at the burned-out home \u00bb . Police said about 25 people attended the holiday party where Pardo, dressed in a full Santa Claus outfit, came in the front door and then moved through the house, firing two semiautomatic handguns. Covina police Friday released a recording of a chaotic 911 call. Voices are heard on the recording yelling, \"Stay away from the window!\" and pleading, \"Please come immediately ... he's shooting! He's shooting!\" Later a voice gasps, \"He's left the house -- my mom's house is on fire!\" A distraught woman cries, \"My daughter's been shot! She was shot in the face on the side, and she's bleeding!\" Police said Pardo brought four handguns to the home. The first victim was an 8-year-old girl who ran to the door after hearing a knock, police said. She was shot in the face but survived. \"She has a very, very severe injury to her face. It's not life-threatening, but she's got a very tough road ahead of her,\" Lt. Pat Buchanan of the Covina Police Department said at a news conference Thursday.  Watch police describe girl's injuries \u00bb . Raney said Friday that witnesses, who may have caught only glimpses of what was happening because of the chaos, thought Pardo may have targeted some victims. He said witnesses at the party said Pardo may have stood over some of the victims and executed them. Raney said people at the party were jumping out of windows on both floors of the house trying to escape the gunfire and flames. \"The information we have so far is that Mr. Pardo was married to the daughter of the resident of the house,\" Raney said. \"They'd been married for possibly one year, had recently divorced and a settlement was reached apparently last week. It sounds like that might have been a very contentious divorce.\" Investigators have yet to identify the charred bodies recovered from the burned house, which belonged to Pardo's ex-in-laws.  Watch how the massacre unfolded \u00bb . In addition to the nine people killed, police said three people were injured, including the 8-year-old girl. A 16-year-old girl was wounded by gunfire and was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, police said, and a woman who jumped out of a second-floor window suffered a broken leg and was hospitalized. Police said they have not accounted for three people: Pardo's ex-mother-in-law, ex-father-in-law and ex-wife. Pardo's neighbors talked to KABC on Thursday as they watched police search his home. \"He's very nice, very sociable,\" Cindy Keenan said. She said Pardo always decorated his home for the holidays. Patrick Guzman said when he encountered Pardo in his yard about two hours before the attack, \"He seemed normal.\" \"He said 'Merry Christmas' to me,\" Guzman said. Ed Winter, assistant chief Los Angeles County coroner, said the bodies recovered were \"severely burned and charred\" and dental and medical records and X-rays will be necessary to establish identities. Winter said the intense fire caused the top floor of the two-story house to collapse onto the first floor. Pardo's body was discovered about 30 miles from the shooting scene at his brother's house in the Los Angeles suburb of Sylmar, dead from \"a self-inflicted gunshot wound,\" police said. Relatives returning to the house found Pardo's body, police said. Buchanan said police received several 911 calls at 8:27 p.m. Wednesday. When officers arrived at the house three to four minutes after the first call, the dwelling was engulfed in flames. The fire was so intense that firefighters battled the blaze for an hour and a half before knocking the flames down so that officers \"were able to look into the house from the outside, and initially saw three bodies in the front portion of the house,\" he said. As uninjured people were trying to escape, Buchanan said, \"that's when he (Pardo) lit the accelerant in some manner -- we do not know how at this point -- and he fled the scene.\" Buchanan said the device that spread accelerant was \"nothing that we or the arson-explosives unit has ever seen before. It appears to be homemade.\" A Christmas Eve party at the house was a family tradition, Raney said, and the party had often featured a visit from a neighbor who was dressed as Santa Claus. He said that neighbor has moved out of the neighborhood and was not at the party Wednesday night. Referring to Pardo, Buchanan said, \"We don't know at this point whether he was aware that there was a Santa Claus in years past. We're assuming that he did, and that's the reason for the outfit.\"", "eb2e5017b44cf72b6db498ed074146897f8daa2d": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- U.S. authorities arrested six people Wednesday on suspicion of smuggling African elephant ivory worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, law enforcement officials said. Imports of African elephant ivory have been banned in the United States since 1976. The defendants arranged to have ivory from Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Uganda shipped into the United States disguised as wooden snakes, guitars and statues, authorities said. \"The defendants plundered precious natural resources for personal profit,\" U.S. Attorney Benton J. Campbell and other officials said in a statement. \"Their illegal trade threatens the continued existence of an endangered species and will not be tolerated.\" Federal agents tracked at least eight shipments, including one worth an estimated $165,000. Federal agents used surveillance and shipping, phone and bank records to track the suspect shipments. Arrests were made in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and Texas. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the Department of Homeland Security were involved in the law enforcement operation. One suspect told an undercover federal agent during a purchase that it was difficult to bring ivory into the United States, but easy to sell it at high prices, the government statement said. Two other suspects also are accused of paying a courier $15,000 to bring a shipment of ivory from Cameroon into the United States. The U.S. banned ivory imports in 1976, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora effectively outlawed trade in elephant tissue in 1989. Illegal trade in African elephant ivory is considered to be a major cause of the continuing decline of elephant populations in Africa. The defendants are expected to appear in court in New York on Wednesday. They face jail terms of up to 20 years if convicted.", "1a7a8054368d7ff37ad58ae1efdfddd7d7954a95": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- CNN White House correspondent Suzanne Malveaux has covered the Bush administration for six years. CNN's Suzanne Malveaux shares a light moment with President Bush during his final press conference Monday. As always, she was in the room Monday when Bush held his final press conference, an almost hourlong event in which the president answered questions about current issues and reflected on his eight years in office. Here Malveaux reflects on her time covering the Bush administration and on the final White House press conference, which she described as \"raw,\" \"fascinating\" and \"bizarre.\" Q: How do you compare this to previous briefings? Malveaux: This was an extraordinary press conference. It took the president a little time to warm up. He called on me third. About two questions after that, he embraced this different kind of mood and revealed things about himself that he didn't before.  Watch Bush talk about his respect for the press \u00bb . We'd heard a bit about his misgivings before, but we didn't expect to hear about his disappointments -- \"Sometimes the biggest disappointments will come from your so-called friends.\" At times he looked directly at me, other times away, in flashes of rage. And occasionally he turned to all of us pleading with an expression for understanding, empathy. He raised his voice when it was suggested that he was alone, insisting that he never felt the burden of the office: \"I believe this -- the phrase 'burdens of the office' is overstated,\" he said. But at other points he reflected on the weight of the job: \"You never escape the presidency. It travels with you wherever you go.\" When he was discussing Iraq, he was almost yelling, defending his administration. He was using gestures, leaning forward on the podium, his finger raised in the air. It was dramatic. Q: What was it like in the room? A: You saw at times a defiant President Bush as well as ultimately reflective in some ways. We know he regretted the \"Mission Accomplished\" banner on the aircraft carrier. But we heard some new details about how he had some regrets that Air Force One flew over New Orleans at that critical time when the city was under water during Katrina, as opposed to landing. He said he was wary of taking away law enforcement and rescue resources on the ground. But later in the press conference he was defiant about Hurricane Katrina, telling us: \"Don't tell me the federal response was slow when there was 30,000 people pulled off roofs right after the storm passed.\"  Watch Bush defend the response to Katrina \u00bb . It was from there the president shifted to the president-elect. He discussed the fact that many people never thought they'd see the day when a black man would become the president, and it spoke volumes about the progress the country's made with race. At that time, he seemed misty-eyed. Q: Were you surprised at how candid the president was? A: This is certainly the most open he has been about some of the failures of his administration. You know, what was interesting, he took us back to the time of September 11 in a very emotional and strident way. He said -- remember those times when they had those tough questions, why didn't you put the dots together? It was almost as if he felt like he couldn't win either way. But at the same time, he said self-pity was pathetic and it wasn't something he was going to engage in. It was a very interesting look at President Bush grappling with all of these different things -- the successes as well as the failures. You get a sense here that he is looking at his legacy, that he's trying to come to terms with some of the things he did, his role in all of this. Q: Was there any one moment that stood out to you? A: He was most defiant when he talked about what he believes are the threats, potential threats against the United States. You could see him becoming emotional -- that this is something the future president is going to have to deal with, that he is going to have face. Every single time he went back to the threat out there, it seemed he wanted to reveal more, and would wish Barack Obama the best. At times, Bush seemed to be speaking directly to the president-elect: \"He'll get in the Oval Office, and there will be a lot of people that are real critical and harsh, and he'll be disappointed at times by the tone of the rhetoric.\"  Watch how Bush and Obama are working out the shift of power \u00bb . Q: The president ribbed you about the pronunciation of your name because it's French, even jokingly saying you can call him \"Georges.\" But he finally got your name right. A: Yes, you could say the president and I have had an ongoing standoff for years now. When I first met the president, he called me Suzanne [said: Sue-zan], and I initially corrected him: \"It's Suzanne. Rhymes with John.\" The president would blame it on his Texas accent. Actually, the first time he got it right was years ago on a trip to India and Pakistan. I remember feeling shocked. Sometimes I thought he intentionally called me \"Sue-zan,\" if he was angry with my questions. Q: Any other surprises about this press conference? A: He didn't call on Helen Thomas, who is widely viewed as the dean of the White House press corps. She's been critical of President Bush and been covering presidents since Kennedy. She was out there, front row center with her hand raised.", "5020b6f34983b2805e30225104e932346b041bdd": "(CNN) -- Our dog Tilly loves the holiday season. Turkey for Thanksgiving. Brisket for Hanukkah. Ham for Christmas and pot roast for New Year's. With so much food moving around the house and visitors who generously -- and covertly -- feed her under the table, Tilly has always been a happy dog during the season of giving. Two reluctant reindeer: Tilly, left, and Riley. Not anymore. After we spent much of one holiday season at the animal emergency center trying to keep Tilly alive, our holiday celebration turned into a hunt for household toxics. Tilly was diagnosed with severe anemia, which could have been caused by any one of numerous toxic items found in the refrigerators, cupboards and medicine cabinets of most homes. Now, Tilly's kibble and treats practically need their own passport to reach her mouth; human food is out of reach; visitors are asked to put away any medications and shown where the \"approved\" treats are kept. It may sound extreme, but veterinary medical experts say this type of preventative behavior can keep pets safe. This is especially true during the holidays, when family chaos increases and your pet's environment may change from day to day with the arrival of family and friends bearing gifts, holiday food items and exotic plants. \"Dogs and cats do not know what is bad for them,\" said Dr. Cynthia Gaskill, associate professor and veterinary clinical toxicologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. \"If there is medicine on the bathroom counter or food left on the table, that is irresistible to them.\" And unless your houseguests are conscientious pet owners themselves, chances are they aren't aware that they may be creating a toxic environment for your pet. Gaskill says it is important to let guests know not to leave their medications in an open suitcase or otherwise exposed. Over-the-counter and prescription medications can kill small animals. Because metabolic systems vary between species, a drug that may alleviate pain in humans can easily induce a toxic reaction in a dog or cat. For example, ibuprofen ingested by a dog can cause gastrointestinal damage and kidney dysfunction. Cats are especially susceptible to even small amounts of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol); ingestion of just one tablet can result in anemia and potential liver damage. Dr. Robin Van Metre, a veterinarian at the Fort Collins Veterinary Emergency Hospital in Colorado, says that many of the emergency calls he receives involve pets that have accidentally ingested prescription medications or been given an over-the-counter medication by well-meaning owners who believe that their animal is in pain. Van Metre says these calls increase significantly over the holidays. \"Dogs will eat almost anything,\" Van Metre said, \"and there is no such thing as a dog-proof cap.\" Take care in the kitchen, too. Typical holiday staples such as grapes and raisins have been shown to cause renal failure when ingested by dogs. Although small amounts of onions and garlic are often used in pet foods and treats to add flavor, ingestion of large amounts can cause severe red blood cell damage; cats are especially sensitive. Macadamia nuts can cause a short-term hind-limb paralysis, and bread dough, if eaten before baking, can expand rapidly once ingested and cause ethanol poisoning. Sweets, gum and hard candies are often problematic depending on ingredients. Chocolate contains a theobromine, a chemical that can affect the heart, kidneys and central nervous system. Dark chocolate and baker's chocolate contain higher concentrations of theobromine and are more toxic than similar amounts of milk chocolate. Sugar-free gums and candies that contain the sugar-substitute xylitol can lead to quick onset of toxic clinical signs that may include a rapid decrease in blood sugar and possible seizures. Think carefully before placing mistletoe or holly in low-lying areas, but put poinsettias anywhere you like. The effects of the poinsettia, long believed poisonous, are generally benign, says Dr. Anthony Knight, author of A Guide to Poisonous House and Garden Plants and professor of clinical sciences and toxicology at Colorado State University School of Veterinary Medicine and Biological Sciences. Exposed plant bulbs such as Amaryllis and all species of lilies should be placed out of reach of pets not only during the holidays but year-round, Knight says. Lily toxicity in cats can reach critical levels almost immediately after ingestion and lead to acute kidney failure within 48 hours or less. \"Lilies are one of the most poisonous houseplants that exists,\" Knight said. \"It's not just the flower but also the leaves. ... If a cat eats any part of the plant, it would need to be treated immediately.\" What should you do if your pet ingests a toxic holiday treat? \"Do not wait,\" Van Metre said. \"Most people wait too long to call us, and that reduces our options for treatment.\" Van Metre recommends calling a local veterinarian or animal emergency hospital first, or the ASPCA national animal poison control center (888-426-4435). The ASPCA charges a $60 veterinary consultation fee, but information about toxins is free on the ASPCA Web site. Gaskill does not advise calling human poison control centers or attempting to diagnose your pet on the Internet. Human poison control \"is often not aware of the species differences and could inadvertently give the wrong advice,\" Gaskill said. \"When doing a general Internet search, make sure the site is backed by a recognized veterinary organization or veterinary medical school. If it is not referenced, it is just someone's opinion.\" Van Metre and Gaskill both warn against inducing vomiting in your pet before speaking with a veterinarian. Getting appropriate background information about the animal is critical to preparing a treatment plan for a particular toxin, they say, and every case -- every animal -- is different. Tilly never recovered from her anemia, but she has been in remission long enough to create another toxic scare. After learning that Tilly had ingested an entire bag of Hershey's kisses, we called our local animal emergency hospital in Atlanta. They did a quick calculation using Tilly's weight to determine whether a one-pound bag of milk chocolate would reach toxic levels in a dog of her size. It would not, but we were forced to clean up the silver-streaked evidence for many days afterwards. Melissa Tarkington is a former journalist for MSNBC, CNN.com and The Moscow Times.

He was in Washington to give a sermon Tuesday at St. John's Church, a short walk from the White House. It's unclear what was said in any of these exchanges, but Bush made clear to the nation last week that his presidency was challenging and that he is \"filled with gratitude.\" Though there has been \"legitimate debate\" about many of his decisions, including the war in Iraq, Bush said, \"there can be little debate about the results. America has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil.\" Noting that Bush's last day in the home he has known for eight years was fraught with emotion, press secretary Dana Perino spoke affectionately about her boss. Bush \"gave me a kiss on the forehead,\" she said. \"It's something I will never forget.\" An attempt to sweeten the memories of the White House press corps was made Tuesday when Perino gave reporters boxes of M&Ms. The candies were wrapped with a presidential seal and signed by President Bush. Shortly before President Barack Obama and his family arrived at the White House, Bush took a last walk around the South Lawn. He spent his remaining time at the White House with his family.

At least 800,000 people are thought to have died during 100 days of violence in Rwanda in 1994. \"We can tell you there are Rwandan soldiers here, but I cannot confirm the numbers,\" said Madnodje Mounoubai, spokesman for the U.N. mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Rwandans will team up \"with the Congolese forces,\" he said Wednesday. \"The Rwandan forces are in a meeting with Congolese forces and the understanding is that in the meeting they are preparing a joint operation against the FDLR,\" or the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda. The Rwanda News Agency reported that Rwanda has dispatched 1,917 soldiers. Rwanda and Congo traditionally have been on different sides of the conflict in eastern Congo. The struggle pits ethnic Tutsis, supported by Rwanda, against ethnic Hutu, backed by Congo. The conflict is effectively an extension of the Rwandan genocide dating back to the early 1990s, when hundreds of thousands of Rwandans were killed in ethnic battles between minority Tutsi and majority Hutu. According to a statement issued last week by the Rwandan government, the joint military operation is aimed at driving out the FDLR and former members of the Interhamwe militia, \"remnants of those who spearheaded the 1994 genocide against Tutsis.\" Michael Arunga, a Kenya-based spokesman for the World Vision aid organization, said his colleagues in Goma -- a city in eastern Congo -- told him that Rwandan troops arrived Tuesday morning in the village of Ishsha, outside of Goma. Arunga said he had no knowledge of Rwandan troops being in Congo before. A U.N. statement said the FDLR has been involved in clashes since late August mainly in North Kivu, \"where the national army, the mainly Tutsi militia -- known as the CNDP -- and other rebel groups ... have fought in shifting alliances, uprooting around 250,000 civilians on top of the 800,000 already displaced by violence in recent years.\"  See photos from Mia Farrow's trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo \u00bb . A report by a U.N. Security Council panel last month said Rwanda and Congo were fighting a brutal proxy war for territory and precious natural resources in eastern Congo, and all parties involved in the conflict were using execution, rape and child soldiers as tools of war. The report, filed by a panel of U.N. experts, \"found evidence that Rwandan authorities have sent officers and units of the Rwanda Defense Forces\" into Congo in support of Congo rebel leader Laurent Nkunda's fighters.

Oscar winner Helen Mirren dazzled in Chopard diamonds last year and gained masses of publicity for the jeweler . Up until a fortnight ago, the million dollar question was whether the Oscars would go ahead as stars refused to cross the picket line. Make that the 400 million dollar question. According to the pundits and bean-counters, that's how much the strike would have cost Los Angeles and the industry if Hollywood's most glamorous evening had been cancelled. Not only would the stars have been robbed of their moment to shimmer along the world's most famous red carpet, but a whole hinterland of ancillary trades would be affected. Limo drivers driven to despair, caterers with no-one to cater for, make-up artists struggling to make up lost earnings and security teams facing an insecure future -- and the paparazzi would have no-one to focus on. But it's not just the little guys who would have lost out on the Oscars millions. Big-name jewelry designers like Chopard traditionally dress the stars. Kate Winslet, Charlize Theron and Hilary Swank are among their successful models at the Academy Awards. Last year, Helen Mirren wore a 55 carat diamond flower bracelet along with a 62 carat diamond brooch worth $4m dollars to accept the Best Actress gong. It is estimated that having a celebrity pictured in an item of jewelry or an outfit can be worth $1m in publicity for a jeweler or fashion house. With hundreds of celebrities strutting the red carpet on Oscars night, the scope for generating revenue is seemingly endless. But even Chopard's famous sparkle was tested by the uncertainty surrounding this year's event. \"Leading up to the Oscars business for the whole of Rodeo Drive was a little sketchy. Everyone was thinking, what's gonna happen?\" Wes Carroll, Chopard spokesman, told CNN. \"We felt for the writers, we felt for the studios and we wanted a great outcome for everyone. We would have been very disappointed had the Oscars not happened.\" Films which achieve success at the Academy Awards can expect a new injection of cash with a boost in DVD sales and renewed interest at the box office. Robert Buchsbaum, a Los Angeles theater boss, told CNN, \"It's not just the studios who are affected by the Academy Awards show. It's theater owners. As a single-screen theater owner, my whole year is based on how well films perform from November through March through the Academy Awards. It's the busiest time of year for me.\" \"We really try to figure out, not just what the big Academy Award film is gonna be -- the Best Picture -- but also the smaller films, the independent films which might get the edge like Juno and There Will Be Blood, films which will have a lot of legs to them once they get the nomination,\" he continued. \"It usually means between 25% and 75% in box office revenues alone.\" The prime candidate for a new lease of life at the box office is the Coen Brothers' film, \"No Country for Old Men.\" On the opposite side of the U.S., New York critics are expecting it to yield a decent crop of Oscars after taking their own awards night by storm. Stephen Whitty, Chair of the New York Film Critics' Circle, told CNN, \"It won best picture because the direction from the Coen brothers was really assured. They were completely in control of the mood throughout that film. \"I think the screenplay, also by the Coens, while being truthful to Cormack McCarthy's book, managed to turn it into cinema,\" he continued. \"It made it consistently visual and imparted its message and its mood through images. The acting -- and again, Javier Bardem got the fourth of the four awards we gave it -- I thought the acting was spot on throughout.\" Will the rest of the results be equally clear cut? If so, the tips are Daniel Day Lewis and Julie Christie for Best Leads, Diablo Cody for Original Screenplay for \"Juno,\" \"Atonement\" for Best Score, Mike Moore for Best Documentary for \"Sicko,\" and in the Year of the Rat, Best Animation is marked for \"Ratatouille.\" But of course, no one can really be that certain. Just ask producer Graham King, who seemed set to take Best Picture for \"The Aviator\" after it won virtually every award except the Nobel Peace Prize. But it wasn't to be, after Clint Eastwood's \"Million Dollar Baby\" pipped him to the post. Then a year ago, King finally won the big one with \"The Departed.\" One year on from winning the Oscar, he spoke with CNN's Quest team about how his life changed. \"I think for a good few months after the Academy Awards I was floating on air,\" he said. \"It was really hard to come down from it and it was hard to realize that you'd achieved the goal that you'd set out to achieve many years ago. There it is: in one night, you've got it.\" And as King explains, even Oscar-winning Hollywood producers are prone to attacks of the jitters too. \"It was a year where I just took stock and decided what I wanted to do next and what kind of movies I want to make,\" he told CNN. \"Then, bam! We get hit with this strike, which was horrendous. I felt like I was unemployed ... your phone calls go from 60 or 70 a day to three and emails were not coming in and I felt really insecure about it.\" For producers like King, the end of the writers strike is crucial for their business -- far more important than whether the Oscar ceremony takes place. But imagine being producer of the Best Picture in the one year when the ceremony was cancelled. And it's inconceivable to think of Hollywood without the Oscars. Picture Rio without its Carnival, London without the Queen, New York without the Statue of Liberty. The famous statuettes of Los Angeles may be somewhat smaller, but their presence is felt far beyond the Hollywood hills ...

Peter Sellers in \"Dr. Strangelove,\" just one of Kubrick's classics beaten to the prize by a glitzy musical . From acting turns that kept us glued to the screen, to directors that were passed over by the Academy time and time again, these are the statues we would have given out if we'd been in charge. Don't agree? Think we've missed one or robbed an actual winner of its top-spot? Share your views by using the Sound Off box below and we'll publish the best. 1. Stanley Kubrick's double snub 1968/1964 . In two equally baffling instances, the last true auteur's work was denied the prize. Cold War classic \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\" lost out to George Cukor's \"My Fair Lady\" while his genre-defining sci-fi epic \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" was beaten by Carol Reed's threadbare \"Oliver!\" Glossy Hollywood musicals hailed above two of the most influential movies ever made: are you serious? Truly, this is Oscar's greatest travesty. 2. \"Citizen Kane,\" denied best picture 1941 . It has been topping critics' lists since its release over 60 years ago, but this work of cinematic genius left the 1941 Oscars almost empty handed. Nominated for nine, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, \"Citizen Kane\" was beaten to the prize by \"How Green Was My Valley,\" a sentimental epic about Welsh miners. 3. Martin Scorsese, ever the bridesmaid 1976/1980/1990 . Finally recognized last year for his work on \"The Departed,\" for years it looked like Scorsese would always play bridesmaid to some distinctly mediocre brides. The three biggest Oscar crimes against Marty: \"Taxi Driver,\" \"Raging Bull\" and \"Goodfellas.\" For the latter, he was beaten by Kevin Costner for \"Dances With Wolves.\" Fair enough, it's the only Costner-helmed film that isn't utterly abysmal, but better than Scorsese's best? We don't think so. 4. James Dean: Rebel without an Oscar 1955/1956 . The only actor to receive more than one posthumous nomination, Dean still failed to secure the statue, despite turning in three amazing performances in one year. Nominated for his roles in \"East of Eden\" and \"Giant,\" and overlooked for the iconic \"Rebel Without a Cause,\" three performances that put him into Hollywood folklore as an acting great, he lost out second time round to Yul Brynner in \"The King and I.\" Is it us or are the sentimental musicals trumping the all-time classics? 5. Alfred Hitchcock's Academy curse 1958 . One of the greatest directors of all time, Hitchcock never won the best director award. Nominated just four times, he was only beaten by the finest directors of the day, including Billy Wilder and Elia Kazan. But how could the nomination committee overlook \"Vertigo\"? Today it's considered one of his true masterpieces. No nomination for Hitchcock, and instead the academy hand the award to Vincente Minnelli, the director of \"Gigi\" -- another tooth-gratingly glitzy musical. 6. \"Pulp Fiction\" and Morgan Freeman get Gump-ed 1994 . Whether you like \"Forrest Gump\" or not, it's hard to defend the decision that saw Tom Hanks take his second acting Oscar ahead of the definitive performance of one of Hollywood's elder statesmen, Morgan Freeman, in Frank Darabont's \"Shawshank Redemption.\" And as for the Academy passing over \"Pulp Fiction\" or its director, Quentin Tarantino in favor of a comfortable family flick? That left us speechless. Where's the Academy's court of appeal? 7. Robert Duvall steals the show, but is robbed of the award 1979 . It's hard to stand out in a cast that has Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper in it, let alone when the project's directed with powerful skill by Francis Ford Coppola, but the wild ravings of Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore stand out as the highlight in the excellent and affecting \"Apocalypse Now.\" We hate the smell of Oscar injustice in the morning. 8. \"LA Confidential\" is sunk by a blockbuster 1997 . Ok, it was an impressive venture, and the technical frills were unrivalled at the time, but \"Titanic\" just wasn't the best film of the year. A flimsy script, plus performances far from the actors' best, failed to deter voters: the movie picked up a record 11 awards. Versus \"LA Confidential,\" or even the impressive \"Good Will Hunting,\" it simply doesn't float. 9. Al Pacino's best apparently not good enough 1976 . Pacino may have descended into a constant stream of shouting in his later roles (something that can be seen in abundance in \"Any Given Sunday\" or \"Devil's Advocate\"), but his magnetic performance as sensitive Michael Corleone in \"The Godfather\" sees him at his compelling best. Joel Grey's performance in \"Cabaret\" (more musicals! Argh!) is nothing if not annoying, and certainly not a patch on Pacino's finest hour. 10. \"Brokeback Mountain\" wins everything but an Oscar 2005 . In the approach to the Academy Awards it had been winning major prizes, scooping the best picture BAFTA and Golden Globe and earning director Ang Lee a Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, but when it came to the Oscars, the movie mysteriously missed out. \"Crash,\" the actual winner, is not a bad film, but it pales in comparison to the sensitive and highly emotional \"Brokeback Mountain.\" ....................................

Sly and the family Stallone \"win\" big . With 30 nominations and 10 awards, including worst actor of the century, Sly is the biggest \"winner\" in Razzie history. Most notably, in 1985 he and his family cleaned up, as he took worst actor, director and screenplay awards, his wife Brigitte Nielsen scooped worst supporting actress and worst new star, and Sly's brother Frank received worst original song for \"Peace in Our Time\" from \"Rambo II.\" Their parents must be so proud. Madonna fails to get the hint . She's not known for her acting, but Madge just won't let it go. With fewer than 20 full-length feature roles under her belt, the queen of pop has picked up 15 Razzie nominations and nine awards for her weak performances. In 2002 she cleaned up, taking Worst Actress, Worst Supporting Actress and half of the Worst Couple. You really can't fault her consistency. \"Showgirls\" breaks Razzie records . This record-breaking clunker was nominated for 13 awards in 1995: admirable, since there were only 10 categories that year. It also claimed the most wins, taking home a well-deserved seven awards, including Worst Director and Worst Picture, which were collected in person by director Paul Verhoeven, the first winner to attend the show to collect Razzies. Respect. Eddie Murphy: man of 2008 . This year's show sees the comedian who was up for an Oscar last year pick up a record five nominations for one person in a year, for his work in Worst Picture nominee \"Norbit.\" Having played multiple characters, Murphy is up for Worst Actor, Worst Supporting Actor, Worst Supporting Actress, Worst Couple (nominated with himself) and Worst Screenplay. A truly impressive haul: good work, Eddie. Battlefield Earth \"succeeds\" in every category . John Travolta's Scientology/sci-fi movie was nominated for a meager eight awards, but brought home the bacon as it took seven of those awards on the night. Only Forrest Whitaker failed to convert his nomination, pipped to the post by co-star Barry Pepper. If it makes them feel any better, we think they deserved all eight. .................................... Don't agree? Think we've missed one?

Durcho's cousin found Rust's body and called officers, who found the children's bodies in the apartment, says an affidavit written by a special agent with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. An apparent acquaintance of Durcho's told police he came to her apartment Monday afternoon and told her he had \"choked\" Summer Rust to death and he was leaving Oklahoma, according to the affidavit. The affidavit says Durcho told the woman \"that the children were at their grandmother's residence ... while he and Summer worked out their relationship problems.\" Rust's mother, Susan Rust of Carson City, Nevada, said Durcho was unemployed and had been living with Rust and her children. Authorities in Texas said Durcho was arrested after a state trooper attempted to stop his car because the trooper suspected that the driver was drunk. When the trooper ran the license plate on the car, it matched the tag number of a vehicle sought by Oklahoma police.", "9a19200792db252cc156ac0b7c2b4640a9dc340a": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Marine commander on Wednesday warned of a \"growing\" insurgent threat in Afghanistan, but he said forces would have to be cut in Iraq to send more Marines to Afghanistan. Marines could be pulled from Iraq's Anbar province, Gen. James Conway said Wednesday. \"To do more in Afghanistan, our Marines have got to see relief elsewhere,\" said Gen. James Conway in a briefing for Pentagon reporters. Conway said the Corps' two regimental combat teams -- about 10,000 Marines -- in Iraq's Anbar province could be removed as there are only two or three insurgent attacks a day in what was once the hotbed of the Iraqi insurgency. The U.S.-led coalition is scheduled to hand over security control in Anbar to Iraqi troops next week. Despite the progress, Conway said, he doesn't expect any decisions on troop withdrawals until Gen. David Petraeus -- the head of the U.S. military in Iraq -- makes his recommendations on troop deployment in Iraq to President Bush and Defense Secretary Robert Gates. There are more than 3,000 Marines in Afghanistan, and Conway said that the Marine Corps would be willing to help bolster the fight against the Taliban in that country. \"I think that a battalion of Marines in Afghanistan count for more than a battalion of Marines in Iraq, if you will, just in terms of the impact that they can have,\" he said.", "8c8ad7876226f634c31e66a95aa352d6be824abe": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- While the Oscars is without doubt the grandest of all the awards ceremonies, it doesn't have the world stage to itself. \"Persepolis\" won the French nomination -- but failed to make the Academy's shortlist . In London, the Brits have their BAFTAs; Spain has the Goyas; and France celebrates the Cesars, where \"La Vie En Rose\" won six out of its \"magnifique\" 11 nominations. And it was this foreign fare that gave rise to the biggest controversy at Hollywood's big event. \"La Vie En Rose\" amassed an impressive eleven nominations at the French Cesar Awards. Marion Cotillard's astonishing transformation into Edith Piaf won her Best Actress gongs at the Golden Globes, BAFTAs and the Academy Awards. But \"La Vie En Rose\" was not among the contenders for Best Foreign Film. Another French language film, \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,\" was on many critics' top ten lists for the films of 2007. It won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film and its American director Julian Schnabel was nominated for an Oscar. But like \"La Vie En Rose,\" this film was not among the contenders for Best Foreign Film. A third French film, \"Persepolis\" won the special jury prize at Cannes and it received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, but yet again, this was not a nominee for Best Foreign Film. France suffered through an abundance of riches this year, with three potential Oscar winners. But to enter the race for Best Foreign film, France, like every other country, had to nominate just one. So \"La Vie En Rose\" and \"Diving Bell\" were rejected by the French film authorities in favor of \"Persepolis.\" But \"Persepolis\" didn't sufficiently impress the Oscar judges: so France had no films among the final five nominees. French frustration at the Oscar process was echoed in Taiwan, which chose Ang Lee's film, \"Lust Caution,\" as its official entry. The film won both critical acclaim and the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. But Oscar judges ruled there was too little Taiwanese involvement -- none of the lead actors are from Taiwan. The double Oscar winning director watched in disbelief as his film was banned and Taiwan was told to pick another film instead: Oscar caution triumphing over Ang Lee's lust for a third Academy Award. And the list goes on: the Israeli film, \"The Band's Visit\" was excluded for having too much English -- but it's the only way the Israeli and Egyptian protagonists can communicate in the film and is a key part of the plot. But Israel submitted \"Beaufort\" instead -- and made the final five. \"The Kite Runner\" may have proved an international success at the box office, but it didn't fly with Oscar watchdogs. Set in Afghanistan with Farsi as its main language, it fell foul of the rulebook by having too little Afghan involvement and a Swiss-American director. But for most critics, the most inexplicable omission from the shortlist of nominees was Romania's \"4 Months, 3 weeks & 2 Days,\" winner of the Palme D'Or in Cannes and considered by many to be a sure-fire Oscar winner. Some feel its challenging subject of a back-street abortion in communist Romania was too testing for conservative members of the Academy's Foreign Film Committee, whose volunteers tend to include many retirees -- who else has time to attend screenings of 63 foreign language films? Even Marc Johnson, the Chairman of the Academy's Foreign Language Film Committee, acknowledged that some of the criticism levelled against the Academy this year was \"justifiable\". He told CNN: \"We took quite a beating, and I think quite justifiably, not for the films that we selected but for the films that we DIDN'T select. \"And I felt very passionately about it and spoke out about it more than I should have done, but there was a part of me saying \"wait a minute I didn't sign on for this -- I didn't sign on to be the scapegoat and we received a lot of criticism and yet it's something I feel so passionately about I think foreign language film and particularly subtitled film in the U.S. are really an endangered species.\" Defenders of the Academy also point out that they're only asking countries to nominate their favorite film; they then pick the best of that bunch. Mr Johnson said it would be unfair to allow countries to submit more than one film as the selection process would become \"unmanageable\". \"There have been arguments that why can't a coutnry submit more films? France for instance might argue we make 50 films a year, maybe five of them are Oscar worthy and Ecuador maybe only makes one why is it we have the same group as they?\" . \"Not that I ever like to mix sports with the arts but it's a little bit like the World Cup. Brazil could probably submit five teams but they're only allowed to submit one -- and it's what makes it a fair race,\" he explains. \"The other thing is quite frankly this year we had 63 films. We could not see many more than that. So if we had 5 from this country and 3 from this country it would be completely unmanageable.\" And while the one-film-per-country rule fails to reward a nation with a flourishing film industry, it does ensure diversity: no less than 63 countries from Azerbaijan to Vietnam submitted films for the 80th Academy Awards. Israel, Austria, Poland, Russia, and Kazakhstan -- representing 210 million people in all -- were the countries vying for the prize on Oscar night, and the Academy points to the quality of those on the list, rather those that are not, as ultimate proof that the system works.

Sen. John McCain has said the issue of immigration would be a top priority for him as president. If you follow coverage of their speeches at three Latino events -- the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, the League of United Latin American Citizens and The National Council of La Raza -- the answer would be yes. Why? Because the two candidates are talking about making immigration reform a priority if they reach the White House, and to make it there, they know the Hispanic vote can have a great impact. More than 9 million Hispanics are expected to vote on November 4th. They traditionally favor Democrats, but many have supported Republicans in key races. In 2004, for example, 40 percent of the Latino vote went to President Bush -- so going after them makes political sense. Do Hispanics care about immigration reform? Yes, they do. But it's not the only issue that concerns them.  See where the candidates stand on immigration . They, too, pay more than $4 for a gallon of gas, and are worried about the economy, foreclosures, the war in Iraq and access to health care and education. But the debate on immigration has motivated many to apply for citizenship and many others to register to vote. Hispanics aren't a monolithic group as many seem to believe. Some families go back six or seven generations. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens by birth. Cubans can stay if they make it to U.S soil.  Latinos from all over Latin America come by plane. Surprisingly, a majority of Latino voters show a deep interest in immigration reform, even though it wouldn't benefit them directly because they are U.S. citizens. They believe reform would help in a community that shares a common language, even though it has many differences. They aren't na\u00efve and won't be swayed with tall tales. But to pander has a negative connotation and the concept seems highlighted when it refers to Hispanics, the largest- and fastest-growing minority in the nation. This electorate is familiar with politicians making promises they don't always keep -- and surely will see that McCain favors border security before immigration reform, a reform he put his name on at great cost. They are aware of the need to learn English in order to succeed, and not necessarily for every child to learn Spanish as Obama suggested. That could fuel fears about Hispanic influence, and spur some to use that fear to score political points. In this case, the approach goes in two directions. It can be seen as pandering to a specific group for political gain, but it can also be portrayed as a challenge to Hispanics. With greater clout comes higher responsibility; it means not only registering to vote, but actually doing it on Election Day, making those numbers count, showing that Latinos are more than a group with great potential. Is pandering to Hispanics any different from pandering to other groups? Why isn't there a similar outcry when candidates address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on the future of Israel? Or the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People? Isn't that pandering? Hispanics are coming of political age, and probably face a dilemma. But which is better -- being pandered to, or ignored? And no, it's not a trick question.", "0aef0ffd5443bc582aa944bb8714617afbe51973": "MONTEREY PARK, California (CNN) -- Five men are accused of starting a massive Malibu wildfire at that destroyed more than 50 homes and forced about 15,000 people to evacuate. A firefighter works to contain a wildfire threatening homes in Malibu, California, on November 24. Authorities say the five, ranging in ages from 18 to 27, were drinking in a popular party spot in a cave at the park when they started the fire. All five are from the Los Angeles area and are being charged with three felonies -- including two arson-related charges. Each count carries a sentence of two to four years in prison. Baca said investigators traced the fire to the cave, then used receipts and surveillance camera footage from a nearby store to hunt down the men. Investigators would not comment on why the men started the fire. During the investigation, fire officials speculated that a campfire may have started the blaze -- which engulfed roughly 5,000 acres and destroyed 80 structures, including the 53 homes. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in the wake of the fire, which started on November 24.

Estonian soldiers on patrol near Baghdad in 2004. Estonia's Defense Minister Jaak Aaviksoo said the country will not deploy its next infantry platoon to Iraq, according to a statement from the ministry. Platoon ESTPLA-18 was ready to replace the previous 34-man platoon which returned to Estonia from Iraq in late December, The Baltic Times reported. The Estonian defense ministry announced Thursday it had failed to reach an agreement with Iraq's government about the troops' legal status. Aaviksoo said the absence of a legal agreement \"specifying the legal status of our soldiers\" was one of three reasons Estonia ended its military operation in Iraq. He said the other two reasons were the improving security situation in Iraq and the Iraqi government's desire to \"continue bilateral cooperation in forms other than battle units.\" A bilateral agreement spelling out future defense-related cooperation between Iraq and Estonia is still being hammered out, Aaviksoo said. Estonia will continue to participate in a NATO-led training mission in Iraq, with three staff officers, he said. The Estonian defense ministry said Aaviksoo will soon visit Iraq to formally terminate the Estonian Defense Forces' operation and discuss future defense-related cooperation with his Iraqi counterpart, Abdul Al-Qadir Jassam.

He went on to help build the prominent Atlanta law firm King and Spalding, and then to serve as the nation's top legal officer. He was a chairman of John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign, and Kennedy appointed him to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1961. As a federal judge, Bell was involved in desegregation rulings in the 1960s, and he became known as a moderate legal voice in the South.

She was the campaign manager for the Al Gore-Joe Lieberman ticket in 2000 and wrote \"Cooking with Grease.\" Donna Brazile says Barack Obama's inauguration is a huge milestone in the fight for equal rights . WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Today Barack Obama will be sworn in as the 44th president of the United States of America. This is the day for which so many prayed, so many marched and so many more sacrificed. This is a day of jubilation and celebration. This is the day to rejoice and recommit ourselves to restoring the American dream for us all. Barack Obama's election offers our country the opportunity to open a new chapter that will allow us to turn the corner on past prejudices and racial politics. When Sen. Obama announced his candidacy for president in 2007, most people, black and white, thought it would be, at best, an interesting sideshow. After Obama's victories in the early primaries, there came the controversial videos of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, broadcasting a racial divisiveness that cast even greater doubt on an Obama candidacy. But the senator moved quickly to reassure people that Wright's jaundiced view of America did not reflect his own. Americans wanted to move beyond racial categorization and the politics of division. Obama understood that. And so did the voters. But African-Americans didn't believe it. Seventy-one percent of black voters had never thought a black candidate for president would get elected in their lifetime, according to a national poll released in November by CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Yet 59 percent of white respondents said they had thought it was possible. Obama did not just win the caucuses in Iowa  -- a state with a white population of more than 94 percent -- he resoundingly captured it. Other primary victories, once thought improbable, soon followed. These included Georgia, and Virginia, the former seat of the Confederacy. On Election Day, Obama won a higher percentage of the white vote than John Kerry did in 2004, though he did not get a majority of whites. Unlike other black presidential candidates before him, Obama did not run as \"the black candidate.\" He ran as a Democratic candidate, a U.S. senator from Illinois, and a progressive. And America, by larger margins than in previous recent elections, voted for the progressive Democratic U.S. senator from Illinois who happened to be biracial. For too long, race has been the stain on the American fabric. As Secretary Condoleezza Rice reminded us, race has been our \"nation's birth defect.\" At times during the long primary and general election, race became a subtle distraction -- but the American people rejected it and it was never the primary issue. Nor was it the primary issue for Americans who voted for Barack Obama. The vast majority of those who voted for and against Obama did so based on the content of his political prescriptions and platform -- not the color of his skin. A lot of lessons were taught November 4. Obama's election revealed the possibility of three new truths for African-Americans: White America may not be as racist as African-Americans thought they were; a solution to our country's lingering racial problem may eventually be found; and the Rev. Martin Luther King's dream that one day all people will be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin is alive and within reach. Obama's election has inspired 6 in 10 blacks to forecast better race relations in the United States. \"A majority of blacks now believe that a solution to the country's racial problems will eventually be found,\" said CNN polling director Keating Holland. \"In every previous poll on this topic dating back to 1993, black respondents had always said that racial problems were a permanent part of the American landscape. Even in the most recent polls taken last week, a majority of African-Americans said that a solution to the country's racial problems could be within reach; now blacks and whites agree that racial tensions may end.\" Yes, of course, racism still exists in America. But if a black man can become president of the United States of America, then aren't all Americans now free to believe they can achieve any goal they set for themselves? So on this day, let us all rejoice and be glad. Let us celebrate this moment in American history and let us resolve to find common ground. Let us resolve to join together as a nation to ensure that racial prejudice in America, as well as an ethic of non-achievement based on excuses and low expectations, dies the same death it did in the November ballot box. What our founders envisioned -- what President Lincoln and the Rev. King fought and died for, we are perhaps finally ready to achieve. This is a remarkable moment. Though not the apex we need to reach, it is still a mountaintop, alive with possibilities, a dream no longer deferred.

The Border Patrol captured 695,841 people nationwide in the first three quarters of fiscal year 2007, down from 907,445 for the same period the previous fiscal year, or a 23 percent drop, said Border Patrol spokesman Michael Friel. Arrests along the U.S.-Mexico border declined by 24 percent, he said. Border Patrol officials said the reasons for the change are varied and complex, but Friel said, \"We're clearly seeing a deterrent.\" One factor cited by officials is the end of the practice of releasing non-Mexican immigrants, pending court hearings. The Border Patrol captured  50,349 non-Mexican illegal immigrants nationwide in the nine-month period ending June 30, down from 89,952 during the same period of fiscal 2006. That's a 44 percent decrease. The decrease was 48 percent for non-Mexican illegal immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border. Other factors include the 6,000 National Guard troops patrolling along the Southwest border, more detention space and enhanced enforcement in the interior, Friel said. Outside economic, political and social factors also are \"always involved\" in fluctuating levels of immigrants seeking entry into the United States, he said. Last month, opponents effectively killed President Bush's long-fought and emotion-laden immigration bill in the Senate when members voted against advancing the legislation. The bill aimed to create a path to citizenship for some of the 12 million illegal immigrants and to toughen border security.

In fact, he struggled to take more than a few steps, and as he lay flat on his back, exhausted, airport staff called an ambulance. After repeated warnings from his doctor, Bland decided to come to China as a last-ditch effort to shed the pounds. \"I needed to take it serious because we were talking about my life.\" Bland's weight yo-yoed for years, ballooning after he lost his job 12 years ago. \"Nobody wanted to hire a guy who couldn't move, you know and so, [I] spent the next ...12 years on the couch and watched my weight constantly going up.\"  Watch more on Alonzo Bland's transformative journey \u00bb . At one point he needed an emergency tracheotomy because fat around his neck was crushing his windpipe. Earlier this year, while watching TV on the couch, he did an Internet search for weight-loss competitions. He entered one offering a first prize of an all-expense-paid trip to one of China's most famous boot camps for the obese. The weight-loss clinic is housed in a drab building, far from the city center. \"It's a beautiful place. It really is,\" Bland said. \"It is difficult though: I am away from home -- all my family and friends. But my goal here -- my goal is to lose the weight, so I think in the end I will be healthier and happier.\" Being this far from home, Bland said, has been a clean break from his bad habits. He simply doesn't know where the restaurants are, or how to order takeout. \"It is away from everything I know, all those things -- even the excuses you make up: 'Oh I have to do this today, I can't work out, I have this do.' So coming here eliminated all the excuses.\" So far he has lost nearly 240 pounds -- a result of diet, exercise and traditional Chinese medicine such as acupuncture, which doctors say reduces appetite and increases metabolism. He works out at a gym three times a week, he walks every day and plays badminton as well. Bland's doctors are impressed with his determination to shed the weight. When he was in America, he had a different lifestyle, said Su. If he wanted to eat he would just order on the phone and \"every day stay on sofa, playing games, watching TV,\" Su said. Bland has only been home once in the past seven months, for two weeks. His family was amazed at his weight loss, and more importantly, despite the fears of his doctor, Bland did not put on any weight while he was away. In fact, he woke at 4 a.m. most days, he said, to work out at the gym -- an indication, said his doctors, that he has broken the bad eating and living patterns that caused his weight gain. The ultimate goal for Bland is a weight of 220 pounds. To reach that goal, he must lose another 180 pounds. His doctors hope he can do that in the next five months -- a year after he arrived at the hospital. \"I know I will get there. Will it happen in the next five months? I don't know, but I will get there.\"", "75e6c61d7fb9388bf5dc9faa4cbe963801625aec": "(CNN) -- Polaroid Corp. announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Israeli soldiers stand in front of the Kerem Shalom crossing Thursday on the Israel-Gaza border. Three armed militants tried to infiltrate into Israel near the Kerem Shalom crossing along the southern Gaza border, according to the Israeli military. Israel Defense Forces said it fired at the militants, hitting two of them. It was unclear what happened to the third. In a separate operation, Israeli forces killed another Palestinian militant Thursday near Jabalya in northern Gaza, Palestinian security sources said. The militant was part of a group trying to launch a mortar shell, sources said. On April 9, Palestinian militants infiltrated Israel through the Nahal Oz border crossing in northern Gaza and fired on the fuel terminal there, killing two Israeli civilian workers. In response, Israel halted already reduced fuel shipments to Gaza. It restarted some shipments on Wednesday but shut down the terminal again Thursday because of Palestinian sniper fire, according to the Israeli military. During the brief time the terminal was open, Israel sent 437,000 liters of diesel fuel and 93 tons of gas to Gaza via Nahal Oz, the only transit route for delivering fuel supplies to Gaza. Israeli forces also clashed early Thursday with Palestinian militants in the West Bank village of Qabatiya, killing the local Islamic Jihad leader and his deputy, the Israeli military said. Bilal Hamuda Machmud Zaalah and his deputy, Adin Machmud Hasani Avidot, were hiding in a vehicle when Israeli soldiers and security forces spotted them and surrounded the vehicle, the military said. \"After confirming that the two men were armed, forces fired at the wanted men, killing both,\" according to an IDF statement. Israel blames Zaalah for attacks against Israeli forces in the West Bank town of Jenin as well as other planned strikes inside Israel. But Palestinian medical sources and witnesses said Israeli forces surrounded a house around 3 a.m., ordering the two members of Islamic Jihad to surrender. The militants wouldn't come out, the sources said, and they died in an exchange of fire with the soldiers. The violence came a day after Israeli airstrikes and ground battles with Palestinian militants in Gaza left 21 dead -- 18 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers -- according to Palestinian security sources. A Reuters cameraman and two bystanders were killed in an apparent airstrike near El Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, according to Hamas security sources and Palestinian medical sources. Other civilians and Palestinian militants also were killed in an Israeli strike on El Bureij. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in a statement through his spokesman, said he's \"gravely concerned at the escalation of violence in Gaza and southern Israel\" on Wednesday. \"He condemns the reported civilian casualties among Palestinians, including children, during Israeli military operations, and calls on Israel to abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law and human rights law,\" the statement said. \"The secretary-general also reiterates his condemnation of rocket fire against Israeli civilian targets.

But the jury also watched video from security cameras at the Ritz that gives no outward sign that Henri Paul was drunk when the Mercedes he was driving crashed in an underpass while being chased by paparazzi, as both French and British police have concluded. Paul is seen squatting in the lobby of the hotel to tie his shoe laces, shifting his weight from one foot to another and rising steadily. He is also shown bounding up stairs two at a time. The jury has already heard that Paul ordered two Ricards - an aniseed spirit - that night after arriving at the hotel. The father of the princess's lover Dodi Fayed, Ritz owner Mohamed al Fayed, says Paul was not drunk and that the samples were switched after the tragedy.  Watch footage of Diana's last hours \u00bb . The purpose of the inquest, which is taking place in London, must decide whether the deaths of Diana and Dodi on August 31, 1997 was an accident or murder. It is expected to be a six-month process. Al Fayed says Diana and his son were murdered because the British royal family \"could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be step-father to the future king of England,\" referring to Prince William, the son of Diana and her former husband, Prince Charles. The elaborate efforts of Diana and Dodi to give the paparazzi the slip in the minutes before the tragedy in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel were also shown in a new video. Jurors were shown second-by-second security footage of the couple's efforts to escape the Ritz Hotel undetected. The images show how security staff choreographed a decoy exit in an effort to distract a swelling pack of press photographers and onlookers. But even as Diana and Dodi are led through the bowels of the hotel and out through a service doorway, paparazzi lie in wait. The security footage shows Diana, Dodi's arm around her, standing for 10 minutes behind one exit, waititng for the all-clear to sprint to a car. At one point the princess delivers what appears to be a mock salute as she receives instructions from bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones -- the sole survivor of the crash -- and Paul. The wait over, Diana, Dodi, Paul and Rees-Jones run to a awaiting Mercedes and are immediately surrounded by photographers. But as they leave the paparazzi give chase in cars and on motorcycles. Intriguingly, Paul was earlier seen waving to two photographers who had uncovered the plan to leave by the rear service entrance of the Ritz. On Wednesday previously unseen footage of Diana was shown to the jury. Images taken from a security camera at the Ritz show the 36-year-old smiling as she and Fayed, 42, step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel. Further footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring. Earlier, the coroner at the inquest said it may never be known for certain whether Diana was pregnant when she died. Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate \"one way or the other\" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear \"intimate\" details of her personal life. Baker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory. On Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi's child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage. Next week, the jury is scheduled to travel to Paris to see the crash site, along the River Seine. They are also expected to hear testimony from the paparazzi who were present after the accident.

Kimberly Dawn Trenor is scheduled to go on trial for murder next week in the death of her daughter. But Kimberly Dawn Trenor, 20, pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charge, her lawyer said Wednesday. Trenor and her husband, Royce Clyde Zeigler II, 25, both were charged with tampering with evidence and capital murder in the case of Riley Ann Sawyer, whose body was found in a large blue plastic container on an uninhabited island in Galveston Bay, Texas, in October 2007. The charge of tampering with evidence accused the couple of concealing the child's remains. Trenor was arraigned Tuesday in Galveston, Texas, said her lawyer, Tom Stickler. Jury selection for her trial on the capital murder charge begins Wednesday. The trial will begin in earnest on January 27, he said. The jury also will sentence Trenor on the evidence tampering charge, which carries a penalty of two to 20 years in prison, The Houston Chronicle reported. Zeigler, who is being tried separately, has not been formally arraigned, Stickler said. Both remain in jail. The Houston Chronicle reported bail had been set at $850,000 each. Riley Ann's case garnered national headlines after a fisherman found her body on the island in the bay. Authorities were unsure of her identity, and police dubbed her \"Baby Grace.\" Police distributed composite sketches of the girl nationwide, and Sheryl Sawyers, the girl's paternal grandmother, contacted police from her Ohio home to say the drawing resembled her granddaughter. DNA testing confirmed the child's identity. According to an affidavit, Trenor told police Riley had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held underwater before she died on July 24, 2007. She said the couple hid the girl's body in a storage shed for one to two months before they put it in the plastic container and dumped it into the bay. A medical examiner said Riley's skull was fractured in three places, injuries that would have been fatal. A cross has since been erected on the island where the child was found, which was named Riley's Island in her honor, the Houston Chronicle reported. Trenor moved to Texas from Ohio with the girl in May 2007 to be with Zeigler, whom Trenor had met on the Internet. While in custody, Trenor gave birth this summer to another child, who is now in the care of relatives, Stickler said.", "2b9f6d2414c7374e0239d0e96d456e573184282d": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Previously unseen footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death.

Dr. Richard Batista (left) and his attorney, Dominick Barbara, says the divorce case is not just about a kidney. Dr. Richard Batista and his wife, Dawnell, are fighting over a kidney he gave her. Batista and his attorney, Dominick Barbara, appeared on CNN's Larry King Live on Wednesday to discuss the case and why he filed a lawsuit. The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: When did the wife need the kidney? Richard Batista:  Well, she needed three of them. The one that I donated was back in 2001. King: Who else donated? Batista:  Her father donated the first kidney in -- well, I'm going to go back -- when she was 13 years old. The second kidney she needed after two years of our marriage and that was back in 1992. Thereafter, we had three children, prompting the third kidney transplant, which took place in 2001. King:  How is she doing now? Do you know? Batista: To the best of my knowledge, I understand that her kidney is doing better than mine. King:  When did the marriage go bad? Batista:  It's hard to say, but it was not on a good foundation around the time of the third transplant. King:  What's it like, by the way, to donate a kidney? Batista:  Well, it is probably the most wonderful feeling that you can possibly ever imagine on this planet. King:  Is the surgery difficult? Batista:  The surgery, for me, was performed arthroscopically, so I have several port incisions, with a separate hand incision to allow for the kidney to be extracted. The surgery discomfort and pain itself was not all that horrendous, very tolerable. I was on my feet the following day. King:  What was the cause of the divorce? Batista:  Well, she has her allegations. King:  What were yours? Batista:  Infidelity. That's my reason. Dominick Barbara: Actually, Larry, in the state of New York, it's one of the grounds for divorce. When the show started, you mentioned the demand for the kidney or the value. Really, that's not what's going on. We use that as an example of what the doctor wants. What the doctor wants is, A) health to be taken into consideration in the division of the assets, whether or not she'd be entitled to maintenance or not. But most of all, (what's) being done so he can be part of the children's lives. That's what really this case is all about. King: He's not allowed to be part of their lives now? Batista:  It is my belief that the influence that the children are under, from the household, has put such a pressure on them that they no longer have visitation time with me, despite my most strongest efforts, both through phone call attempts through their mother and through the court system. King:  What is he going to do with a kidney back? Barbara: He doesn't want the kidney. Remember, this is a God-like act when one gives a kidney. You can certainly understand that. No, what he wants the court to do is take into consideration what he's done, what a wonderful thing it is he's done and some understanding from the court. You know, it's so strange; here he does this, and when he says he's allowed to see his children, well, legally he is, but these children have been so alienated from him. By the way, prior to the divorce, you should know that this was a 24/7 dad. The children loved him dearly. He's a broken-hearted man from that. Before we started the litigation, we thought very deeply how it's going to affect everyone. It was out of desperation that he did it. King:  Dr. Batista, you think this might affect other people donating kidneys? Batista:  I hope, at the very least, first of all, I have to say that the real issue here is for me to get my children back. Aside from that, to draw light to the lack of kidney availability, to the number of poor and dying patients across the country who are yearning to live. I hope, and it's my prayer, that this fallout will help enlighten those people who have any question about organ donation come forward, because there are so many people who are dying as a result of not having an organ. King:  In view of how bitter this has gotten, Dr. Batista, if you had to do it over again, would you not donate it? Batista: Without hesitation, I would give another kidney.", "d91d2f3b435c9be31d8613ec2b4634d23a7fb6d9": "(CNN) -- In focus: OPEC quota cuts .

Luckily, he still has a late-1980s picture of actor Kurt Russell with his boxy Mac desktop. Ben Cahan worked with Hollywood films and spotted Kurt Russell sitting with his Mac in the 1980s. Rubbing elbows with big-name celebrities was not unusual for Cahan, who is a software developer. He used his Mac to create Hollywood screenwriting software that formed the basis for programs still in use today. Cahan never expected his old computers to become museum pieces, and he didn't think much about saving funny photos of them at the time. He almost wants to kick himself when he thinks about the lost photo of extraterrestrial attire. \"Who would have thought that would be an interesting picture?\" he mused. But as the Macintosh computer celebrates its 25th birthday Saturday, Cahan and other iReporters are seeking to preserve memories and the history of what they consider to be simple, classic and timeless designs. At the same time, they ponder the purpose of preserving such a short legacy. Gil Poulsen of Franklin Park, New Jersey, says he can understand confusion from people who see the meticulously curated collection in his basement. iReport.com: Go behind the museum's velvet rope . \"Computers almost become like antiques or dinosaurs very quickly. It does seem like a contradiction in terms to have a computer as a museum piece.\"  Watch Poulsen talk about his museum \u00bb . Poulsen keeps an elaborate stash of vintage Macs, portable devices, accessories and artwork. Two of his favorite pieces are a special vertical flat-screen unit made for Apple's 20th anniversary and a chassis cover designed to deflect radiation. Small placards explain the details of each item in the collection, and a velvet rope gives the space a real museum feel. He remembers the days when the computers ran exclusively on floppy disks, necessitating frequent disk switching whenever the onboard memory filled up. As storage innovations cropped up, users sought to purchase additional floppy drives and, later, units with hard drives. His collection chronicles many of these changes. Upstairs, he keeps a couple \"Macquariums\" on display. Among Mac enthusiasts, a popular form of artwork is the conversion of an old Mac case into a shell for a fish tank. The resulting aquarium setup mimics a popular screen saver on the units that featured swimming fish. iReport.com: See iReporter Bob Mushchitz's Macquarium . Building inspectors and plumbers who visit are sometimes taken aback at the little computer museum. \"I often get very strange reactions from contractors visiting the house because they don't quite know what to make of it when they see it,\" Poulsen said. Blake Patterson of Alexandria, Virginia, can certainly relate. His family is in awe of the computer room downstairs, which he calls the \"Byte Cellar.\" He maintains a blog by the same name that chronicles his experiences with vintage computing. iReport.com: Get a peek inside the Byte Cellar . \"My wife is quite amazed and sort of frightened by that. She stays out of the computer room. It's a little bit scary.\" He purchased an original 128K Macintosh in 1985 and has owned several more machines. Much of his collection was built in the past eight years or so. Patterson, who operates Web sites, currently uses a three-screened Mac Pro for high-end tasks.  See both old and new photos of vintage Macs \u00bb . The legacy of the Mac, now 25 years old, is one of innovation, he says. \"It was quite a notable achievement 25 years ago when the Mac first came out. It was a big, new thing. People were a little bit baffled by the innovations.\" Classic Macs were some of the first commercially successful home computers to incorporate a graphical user interface, mouse and streamlined chassis. This new form of design allowed flexibility for manipulating graphics and page layouts onscreen. Mike Tuohy of Seattle, Washington, acknowledges that artists and the Mac seem especially well-suited for one another. In fact, he likes to do much of his art on Mac cases themselves. \"There are certainly out-of-the-box kind of approaches that appeal to me,\" he said. \"That technology appeals to the more artistic side of the population.\" Over the years, he has amassed several old Macintosh units. Some are complete with signatures from Apple developers molded onto the inside of the chassis. He likes to paint the outside of the computers to create artistic interpretations. iReport.com: See the painted Macintosh cases . One piece spins the concept of a \"vintage computer\" on its head with a wood paneling design. Another almost exudes a glow of primary colors. \"I don't want to create a lot of canvas work that I have to drag across the country,\" Tuohy said of his preference for art created on -- and with -- computers. Cahan, the software developer, says he relishes the heyday of the early Macintosh computer lines. He could see the appeal for artistic types like himself. \"I loved Macs in the '80s and '90s,\" Cahan said. \"The entertainment industry was one of the big movers for the Mac back in those days.\" But after all these years, he has opened up to using Windows-based PCs. He points out that perhaps the greatest legacy of the Macintosh's innovation may be the many permutations and inspirations that later occurred. iReport.com: Read about Cahan's encounter with Kurt Russell . \"All the innovation is on the Mac,\" he said. \"But that's what competition is all about. You think the PC people are supposed to sit around and lose their market share? It's just plain old business.\" Looking back, Cahan isn't sure he would have been as successful with computers today as he had been back then when things were simpler. Software development manuals have bloated to upwards of 3 feet thick. \"It costs a million bucks to make stuff nowadays,\" he said. \"Back then, I could do it in my bedroom.\"", "27e34dca10f873b1c116b489de7fe9cd076b9a9c": "(CNN) -- Federal officials are urging consumers to put off eating foods that contain peanut butter until assurances are made that the foods do not contain products manufactured by the Peanut Corp. of America, some of which were found to contain salmonella. A salmonella outbreak has sickened almost 500 people and killed at least six. Food and Drug Administration officials said Saturday that peanut butter and peanut paste made from ground roasted peanuts, manufactured in Peanut Corp.'s Blakely, Georgia, plant were found to contain the bacteria, although a direct link to the strain that has now sickened 474 people in 43 states has not been found. Six deaths may have been connected to this salmonella outbreak. Peanut Corp. announced an expanded recall of peanut butter and peanut paste produced from its Georgia plant Friday night. Peanut Corp. doesn't directly supply to supermarkets, so brand-name peanut butters are not expected to be affected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Instead, Peanut Corp. sells produce in bulk. The peanut butter is sold in containers from 5 to 1,700 pounds. Peanut paste is sold in sizes from 35-pound containers to tankers. The peanut paste is used in the manufacturing of cakes, candies, crackers, cookies and ice cream, FDA officials say. Minnesota and Connecticut health officials have confirmed salmonella Typhimurium linked to this outbreak in bulk containers found in institutions such as prisons, schools and nursing homes. The FDA is urging companies that make these foods to check whether they use peanut butter or paste produced by the company. The recalled peanut butter was manufactured on or after August 8, 2008; the peanut paste was produced on or after September 26, 2008. The administration is urging companies to notify consumers if the products they manufacture may contain peanut products from Peanut Corp. It is also urging companies whose products do not contain Peanut Corp. peanut butter or paste to make that information available to the public. The Kellogg Co. announced a voluntary recall of 16 products, including Keebler and Famous Amos peanut butter cookies, because they contain peanut butter that could be connected to Peanut Corp. The FDA does not have the authority to order a recall of products. It has to rely on companies doing so voluntarily. Congress would have to pass a law to give the FDA such power . Peanut Corp. products are also distributed by King Nut Co., which voluntarily recalled its products a week ago. \"The majority of products [like cookies, crackers, ice cream] are manufactured with products that don't come from PCA,\" said Dr. Stephen Sundlof, the FDA's director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. However, until people can be sure that the peanut cookies or crackers they have do not contain product from Peanut Corp., the FDA is asking consumers to hold off on eating them. Sundlof said a previous outbreak linked to salmonella-contaminated peanut butter showed that the bacteria are not necessarily killed if the product is heat-treated or baked. \"It took temperatures up to 250 degrees [Fahrenheit] to kill salmonella,\" Sundlof said. Even if a cookie is cooked at 350 degrees, it doesn't guarantee that the center of the food gets that hot, making it possible for some some salmonella bacteria to survive. CNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report.", "9d827c2fde85a66357fe5cdcf75bff87c441ec0a": "(AOL Autos) -- The conventional wisdom, among most folks, anyway, is that buying a used car is usually something done out of necessity, by those on a budget -- that is, people who want, or need, to \"move down\" from the new-car market because a new model is simply out of their reach. Bottom line, the Lexus reputation is for high-end luxury, quality and long-term dependability. However, there is another category of used cars that appeal to those with a bit more disposable income: used luxury cars. For some buyers, the used-luxury market is a way of getting into that Lexus, Lincoln, Infiniti or Porsche you always wanted, without laying out $70,000 or $80,000 for something you're not actually going to live in. For others, scouring the used-luxury-car listings is a way of re-visiting the halcyon years of their youth. At this point, some of these used-luxe models have been around so long that they almost qualify as vintage throwback editions. Recently, Consumer Reports magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars, and divvied them up by price range. Using CR's recommendations as a guideline, here is a list of some of the best used luxury cars currently on the market in the $24,000-30,000 price range. 2005 & 2006 Acura MDX . A luxury SUV, the MDX is spacious, seats seven, and boasts distinctive styling and Acura's famed attention to detail. Plus, it packs some punch under the hood -- this generation was powered by 3.5-liter, 253-hp V6 matched to a five-speed automatic transmission. AOL Autos: Used Acura . Priced just right as a new vehicle, it included safety features like dual-stage front airbags, three-point seatbelts and adjustable head restraints for all seating positions. 2007 Acura RDX . A crossover vehicle that mixes sedan-like ride with SUV roominess, the '07 RDX offered unibody construction, leather upholstery, heated front seats, power moonroof, 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, xenon HID headlights with foglamps and the 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine -- plus a five-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters on the steering wheel, and the patented SH-AWD (SH for Super Handling) system. 2006 & 2007 Acura TL . A mid-size, front-wheel-drive, four-door sedan powered by a 258-hp 3.2-liter V6, the Acura TL is a fine road machine. Actually, it was available for '06-'07 as both a TL and a higher-end TL Type S -- the latter of which sported an upgraded engine, a 286-hp 3.5-liter. Depending on trim level, you can find it with a five-speed automatic with a console-mounted lever or shift paddles on the steering wheel. 2007 Audi A3 . Audi designers have always shown a certain flair for dynamics, and that is evident here, in a sharply-engineered, handsomely-appointed vehicle that offers a fine balance between silky ride, nimble handling and zesty performance. This sporty compact was powered by a 200-hp 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine in '07, and came standard with a six-speed manual and an optional Direct Shift Gearbox. AOL Autos: Used Audi . 2005 & 2006 BMW 3-Series . The 3-Series is another winning stable of cars, but Consumer Reports especially liked specific model years/versions/features in the 3-Series family: The 2005 RWD coupe and convertible; the '06 325i RWD sedan; the '06 330i RWD sedan and the '05 Z4. Depending on the model year and version, the standard engine ranged from a 184-hp 2.5-L to a 255-hp 3.0-L. AOL Autos: Used BMW . 2005 & 2006 Infiniti FX35 . Another of the many crossovers that have hit the market the last several years, the FX35 is one of the sportier editions. During these model years, the FX35 2WD came with a 280-hp 3.5-liter V6 and a five-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel-drive was standard, but AWD was also an option. Some spiffier features included leather seating surfaces, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone climate control with microfiltration and steering-wheel controls. AOL Autos: Used Infiniti . Infiniti G35 . The G35 is one of the more svelte sports-sedan beauties on the road, offering Infiniti's typical attention to detail and sporting attitude. Yes, it has four doors, but it handles like a sporty coupe, with its power coming from a finely-tuned 3.5-liter V6. Horsepower output is 280 for the automatic and 298 with the manual. Luxo amenities include leather upholstery, automatic climate control, steering wheel audio controls, illuminated visor vanity mirrors and high-intensity discharge (HID) xenon headlamps. Lexus . Any luxury-car aficionado knows that a Lexus is one of the most exquisitely-designed, high-performing chariots on the luxury-car market, and CR saw fit to include more than a half-dozen Lexus models on this list of recommended used luxury cars -- from the '02 SC and LX models, to the '03-'04 GX edition, '03 LS, '04 / '06 IS entries, '04-'05 RX model, '05 GS and '06 ES to ... well, you get the picture. Bottom line, given the Lexus reputation for high-end luxury, quality and long-term dependability, it's hard to go wrong with any of the above-named Lexus entries. And all have plenty of engine oomph and luxo-line amenities. AOL Autos: Used Lexus . 2007 Lincoln MKX . This luxury crossover vehicle debuted in '07 as a replacement for the Aviator, and made a big splash. A higher-end and pricier version of the Ford Edge, it seats five and is powered by a 265 hp 3.5-liter V-6 and comes with standard six-speed automatic tranny. Either FWD or AWD is available. One cool option was the glass-paneled roof dubbed the \"Vista Roof.\" 2007 Lincoln MKZ . Also new for the '07 model year, this handsome and fully-loaded mid-size luxury sedan replaced the Zephyr. Under the hood purrs a muscular 263-hp V6 hitched to a six-speed automatic transmission. FWD is standard, but AWD is optional. Standard safety features include side-impact air bags in the front; curtain-style head protection airbags for all outboard positions; plus traction control and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution. 2007 Lincoln Town Car . A venerated luxury car whose heritage goes way back, the Town Car still \"has game\" -- and is a far cry from the floaty boats your granddad drove in the '70s and '80s. It's still cavernous inside, but now boasts a much more refined design. It seats six comfortably and is powered by a 239-hp 4.6-liter V-8 that's linked to a four-speed automatic. The well-appointed cabin is trimmed in premium leather and burl walnut appliques. Available in Signature, Signature Limited, Designer and Signature L trim levels, you can find one to fit any taste. 1998 Porsche 911 . No, your eyes don't deceive you -- CR did include a primo, high-line vehicle like a Porsche 911 on its list of recommended used cars under $30,000. But, take note: This is the 1998 edition. But when you're dealing with quality of this level, even an 10-year-old vehicle has a lot of juice left in it. So, by \"going vintage,\" driving enthusiasts can get into their car of their dreams without breaking the bank. In '98, the 911 was powered by a 3.6L H-6 282 hp engine. So, while it wasn't quite the road-burner it is today, is still packed plenty of thrust. 2007 Volvo S60 (FWD) Only a year old, the '07 used edition should still be in fine condition, and it boasts top-drawer performance, stylish design and Volvo's all-world safety features. The '07 S60 came in several trim levels, with an array of engine sizes, from the turbocharged 2.5-liter 208 hp job to the 2.3-liter 257-hp inline five-cylinder plant to the 2.5-liter high-pressure turbocharged and intercooled engine that churned out 300 ponies. Depending on the trim line, either a manual or automatic transmission can be had. 2006 & 2007 Volvo XC70 . The XC70 is a crossover vehicle, splitting the difference between an SUV and a wagon. And it's one of the finest crossovers on the road. It's all-wheel drive, and the latest used-model-year, the '07, was powered by a 208-hp turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder engine matched to a Geartronic five-speed automatic transmission that also offers manual gear selection.", "3d1090ed32b442c478f4f775ca76080839baa88e": "(CNN) -- Robert Barnett, a prominent Washington attorney, has worked on eight national presidential campaigns, focusing on debate preparation. He played the role of George H.W. Bush in practice debates with Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and with Michael Dukakis in 1988, and practice debated Bill Clinton more than 20 times during the 1992 campaign. He also played the role of Dick Cheney in 2000 and 2004 and helped prepare Hillary Clinton for 23 primary debates for the 2008 nomination. Barnett spoke with CNNI's Michael Holmes. Robert Barnett has been in practice debates with Democrats from Geraldine Ferraro to Bill Clinton. CNN: How does Tuesday night's town hall format differ from other debates? Barnett: The individuals will not necessarily express the question as a journalist would. So, for example, one of these people will probably not ask about Internal Revenue Service Code section 341, but rather will ask about their taxes and their tax burdens and what they care about with respect to taxation. And so you have to be very careful to be sure you understand what the individual is asking about and you have to be particularly careful to answer the question, because if you don't, you risk alienating the questioner and the audience and the listeners. CNN: You're in a unique position. You have prepped, I think, seven or eight presidential campaigns. You've done debate prep, you've stood in and played the role of Dick Cheney and others. What's that like? What are you trying to do to prepare the candidate, any candidate? Barnett:  If I'm playing the surrogate, if you will, if I'm the Republican for a Democrat, I try to prepare myself -- not to imitate; I'm not Darrell Hammond or Dana Carvey. I'm not that talented. But I try to be ready with what my candidate that I'm playing, if you will, has said -- the exact words used, the way they counterattack, the way they attack. And I try to make sure that the candidate I'm working with, meaning the Democrat, has heard just about everything that they could hear from their opponent before they ever walk on the stage. CNN: Do you try to bait them, get them to bite a little and then say that's not what you should be doing? Barnett: Well, it can get pretty contested. When I prepared with Rep. Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 when she was running against then-vice president George Herbert Walker Bush, I baited her a lot and she got so angry with me that she frequently walked over to me and slugged me on the arm. So I left the process black and blue. CNN: When you're doing that sort of thing, how direct can you be with the candidate? Or do you have to treat them with a bit of kid gloves? Barnett: I treat them with no kid gloves. It's fair to say I'm direct, I make sure they hear everything from me before they hear it on the stage and maybe hear it even a little more aggressively so they can be prepared.", "f4693cf097efddefb3e5720eeab5ac78afaf440f": "(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain played offense against Sen. Barack Obama during much of the final presidential debate as he challenged his rival on his policies, judgment and character. Obama said he is the candidate who can bring \"fundamental change\" to the country and continued to try to link McCain to President Bush. In one of the more forceful moments of the debate, McCain turned to Obama and said, \"I am not President Bush.\" \"If you want to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago. I'm going to give a new direction to this economy and this country,\" the Arizona senator said.  Watch McCain say he's no Bush \u00bb . McCain aides said they had been working on him to be more explicit in drawing a distinction between himself and Bush. With less than three weeks before the election, it was one of several jabs McCain took at his opponent, who is leading the race in most national polls and has an 8-point lead in CNN's average of national polls. A CNN/Opinion Research poll of people who watched the debate found 58 percent said Obama did the best job while 31 percent said McCain did. Watch entire debate:  Part 1 \u00bb |  Part 2 \u00bb |  Part 3 \u00bb . The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, and the sample of debate-watchers in the poll were 40 percent Democratic and 30 percent Republican. McCain touted what he called his \"long record of reform\" and said to Obama: \"You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.\" Obama said he has a \"history of reaching across the aisle\" and pointed to his support for charter schools, pay for performance for teachers and clean coal technology.  See scenes from the debate \u00bb . \"Sen. Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn't very convincing,\" McCain said. The third and final presidential debate took place at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, and was moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS News.  Analysts weigh in on the debate \u00bb . As McCain tried to put the pressure on Obama, he told the Illinois senator that voters need to \"know the full extent\" of his relationship with Bill Ayers, a former 1960s radical who belonged to the Weather Underground. \"Mr. Ayers is not involved in this campaign, he has never been involved in my campaign, and he will not advise me in the White House,\" Obama said. McCain's campaign has charged that Obama's association with Ayers should cause voters to question his judgment. Ayers was a founding member of the radical Weather Underground, a group that was involved in bombings in the early 1970s, including attacks on the Pentagon and the Capitol. Obama said Ayers had committed \"despicable acts\" 40 years ago, but pointed out that he himself had been 8 years old at the time.  Watch what Obama says about Ayers \u00bb . Obama said Ayers has become the \"centerpiece\" of McCain's campaign and said the fact that McCain keeps bringing Ayers up \"says more about your campaign than it says about me.\" The Republican nominee also brought up comments made last weekend by Rep. John Lewis and pushed Obama to repudiate them. Lewis on Saturday compared the feeling at recent GOP rallies to those of segregationist George Wallace. \"I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters,\" Obama said. \"I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we don't think that comparison is appropriate,\" he said. As the candidates butted heads over tax policy, both made frequent mention of \"Joe the plumber.\"  Watch voters react when 'Joe' comes up \u00bb . Last weekend, while Obama was canvassing for support in Holland, Ohio, the Democratic nominee ran into a man since dubbed Joe the plumber. In that exchange \"Joe\" asked Obama if he believed in the American Dream -- he said he was about to buy a company that makes more than $250,000 a year and was concerned that Obama would tax him more because of it. Obama explained his tax plan in depth, saying it's better to lower taxes for Americans who make less money, so that they could afford to buy from his business. At the debate Wednesday, McCain characterized Obama's plan as trying to \"spread the wealth around.\"  Watch the candidates debate tax plans \u00bb . \"We're going to take Joe's money, give it to Sen. Obama, and let him spread the wealth around. I want Joe the plumber to spread the wealth around,\" McCain said. He added, \"Why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now? Why would you want to do that to anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time?\" Obama countered that both he and McCain want to cut taxes, but that his plan would cut taxes for \"95 percent of American families,\" more than McCain's plan. On spending, Obama promised as president he would \"go through the federal budget page by page, line by line, and cut programs that don't work,\" echoing a vow his rival has made repeatedly. McCain in turn promised an \"across the board spending freeze.\" He said he would balance the federal budget in four years, and went on to name specific programs including subsidies for ethanol when Schieffer pressed both candidates to identify specific budget cuts they would make. The candidates also talked about abortion rights, a topic not addressed in the previous presidential debate.  Watch the candidates debate abortion \u00bb . McCain refused to commit to nominating only judges who opposed abortion, saying he would \"never impose a litmus test\" on court nominees. But he qualified the statement a moment later, saying he would base his nominations on \"qualifications\" -- and that he did not believe a judge who supported Roe v. Wade, the case that legalized abortion, \"would be part of those qualifications.\" McCain hammered Obama on abortion, accusing him of \"aligning himself with the extreme aspect of the pro-abortion movement in America.\" Obama rejected the charge out of hand, saying: \"Nobody is pro-abortion.\" He advocated sex education as a way of reducing the number of unintended pregnancies that result in abortions. \"We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and they should not be engaged in cavalier activity,\" he said. At the conclusion of the debate, Schieffer signed off with a line borrowed from his mother: . \"Go vote now. It will make you feel big and strong.\"", "de67acf0d1ca59b9bcfd917c26a741817e22bf0d": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- The missing engine from a US Airways jet that ditched in the Hudson River was recovered Friday, more than a week after the crash landing. A jet engine lost after Flight 1549 ditched in the Hudson River is hoisted from the water Friday. Icy conditions and strong currents hampered efforts to locate and raise the plane's left engine, which apparently tore from the Airbus A320 when it hit the water in an emergency landing January 15. The engine was found Wednesday in about 50 feet of water. The divers who found it reported that it was in one piece, said New Jersey State Police Sgt. Stephen Jones. A crane brought the engine up Friday afternoon as daylight began to fade. It was placed on a barge and hauled to the New Jersey side of the river, according to a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which was supervising the recovery.  Watch the engine pulled from Hudson River \u00bb . After an initial examination at the site, the engine will be shipped with the plane's other engine to the manufacturer, where \"the NTSB will supervise and direct a complete tear-down of each engine,\" NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said. The right engine was still attached to the plane when it was pulled from the Hudson last week. It will be at least next week before any information from the initial examination is released, Knudson said. Investigators said this week that they found a single feather and evidence of \"soft-body impact damage\" on the aircraft. The find reinforces the pilot's report that the plane was brought down by a flock of birds. Pilot Chesley B. \"Sully\" Sullenberger, 58, told investigators that his aircraft struck birds, disabling both engines, about 90 seconds after takeoff from LaGuardia Airport in New York.  Map \u00bb . The feather, found on a flap track on the wing, was sent to identification experts at the Smithsonian Institution, the National Transportation Safety Board said. Samples of what appears to be organic material found in the right engine and on the wings and fuselage have been sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Meanwhile, a pilot program involving \"birdstrike avoidance\" radar systems will be expanded to include LaGuardia, said a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  See authorities' efforts to retrieve plane \u00bb . The Air Force has been using such systems at its bases for years, and last year the Port Authority -- which operates five metropolitan New York airports -- struck an agreement with the Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration to install the bird-detecting system at John F. Kennedy International Airport. In the wake of the US Airways crash-landing, that program will be expanded to include LaGuardia and Newark International airports within a few months, according to Pasquale DiFulco, spokesman for the Port Authority. Newly released video captured seconds after the Airbus A320 ditched in the Hudson River showed passengers trying to flee the aircraft almost immediately after it settled in the water and began to float along the river current. All 155 crew members and passengers on the plane survived the incident, which Gov. David Paterson dubbed a \"miracle on the Hudson.\" The video, which the Con Edison utility company released Thursday, first shows a long wake behind the plane before zooming in on the aircraft. Steam surrounds the plane as it floats with a slow counterclockwise twist. An exit hatch opens on the plane's left side, and several people file out onto one of the plane's wings. Seconds later, an inflatable evacuation ramp extends from the opposite side of the plane.  Watch their escape \u00bb . Passengers run onto the plane's other wing as the aircraft floats off-screen for a few seconds. The camera jerks, and when the plane reappears, passengers can be seen at the bottom of the inflatable ramp. Some passengers jump into the water, which was a chilly 41 degrees when the plane splashed down on the afternoon of January 15. Within minutes, a ferry and other boats come into the picture and begin to take the people aboard. The video came from a surveillance camera at Con Edison's 59th Street Station, a steam plant, spokesman Chris Olert said. A person manning the camera from inside the plant saw the plane hit the water and redirected the camera, Olert said. CNN's Eliott C.

Pardee Professor of Economics and Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of \"Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919-39\" and \"Financial Crises and What to Do About Them.\" Barry Eichengreen says Barack Obama will have to fix the credit crisis, the auto industry and trade policy. BERKELEY, California (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama has been holding his economic cards close to his vest. He did not participate in person at last weekend's meeting of G20 leaders. He has been reluctant to encourage the lame-duck Congress to adopt a major fiscal stimulus package. He may be right in saying that the U.S. has only one president at a time. But this makes it all the more important that he hit the ground running on January 20. This will mean, first of all, addressing the credit crisis. Despite all the actions of the Fed and the Treasury, the banks are still not lending. In some cases this is because their own finances are weak. But in others it is because they have other more convenient uses for their funds, ranging from acquisitions to dividend payments. This reflects a flawed bank recapitalization scheme that gives the government no voting shares in the banks into which it is injecting public funds and hence no say in their decisions. Fortunately (as it were) there will be an opportunity to correct this, since as the recession deepens there will be more loan losses and the need for more capital injections. The next round of public money should come with voting rights so that taxpayers' interests are protected. Then there is the need for increased public spending on infrastructure and federal grants to state and local governments to offset the collapse of private spending. Candidate Obama spoke of $150 billion of fiscal stimulus. But if this recession turns out to be the deepest since World War II, as now seems certain, the appropriate figure will be at least four times that large. Anything less would fail to cushion the downturn. A trillion-dollar deficit will excite fears of government out of control if not accompanied by a plan to balance the budget once the recession ends. The new president therefore will need to offer not just a stimulus package but also a multiyear budget. Then there is the problem of the auto industry. The best course normally would be Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This would allow the Big Three to shed bad management and contracts, both of which would be thrown out in the bankruptcy process. If GM, Ford or Chrysler is then able to come up with a viable business plan, they should be able to obtain the new money, known as debtor-in-possession financing, needed to implement it. Admittedly, the credit crisis makes new money difficult to obtain. But if this is a problem, then the government can provide the debtor-in-possession financing. In other words, it can make its aid conditional on the Big Three first going through bankruptcy workouts. A further complication arises from the fact that cars last for years and when they break down are expensive to repair. Warranties matter, in other words. If a producer was undergoing bankruptcy reorganization, from which it might or might not emerge, consumers would question whether its warranties were worth the paper they were written on. But if this is the problem, then the government can guarantee the warranties. It could reimburse the cost of major repairs subject to terms and conditions. It is not as if our government has been reluctant to guarantee other products, ranging from bank deposits to money market mutual funds. And this guarantee should be provided only to auto companies that undergo bankruptcy reorganization. Finally, it will be important for the new president to reassure our foreign partners about his economic intentions. There may be jubilation in Kenya and Indonesia over the election of a candidate they may view as a native son, but there is trepidation in Asia and Latin America about his protectionist rhetoric. President Obama will need to reassure Mexico that while he believes in labor and environmental standards, he also believes in NAFTA. He should encourage the Congress to ratify our free trade agreements with Colombia and Korea. He should reassure the Chinese, who now have economic problems of their own, that he will not bash them over their exchange rate policies. If Obama wishes to help Americans impacted by import competition there are better ways. He can expand trade adjustment assistance for displaced workers. He can propose wage insurance -- partial compensation for a limited period for workers moving to lower-paid jobs. He can ramp up spending on education and training. He can address concerns over the environment by proposing a carbon tax rather than allowing blame for global warming to be shifted to Mexico and China. That should be enough to keep the new president occupied for his first 100 days.

John McCain and Barack Obama hammered away at each other's judgment on the economy, domestic policy and foreign affairs as they faced off in their second presidential debate. Obama tried to tie McCain to President Bush's \"failed\" policies, while McCain pushed his image as a \"consistent reformer\" at the debate, which took place at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. The debate was set up as a town hall meeting, and the audience was made up of undecided voters. Obama and McCain fielded questions from the crowd, Internet participants and moderator Tom Brokaw of NBC News. The candidates spoke directly to each other at times, but at other times they spoke as if their opponent were not on the same stage, a few feet away. Debate report card . In comparison to the first debate, Tuesday's event -- which came on the heels of several days of increasingly aggressive attacks from both sides -- took on a more contentious tone. On foreign policy, McCain charged that Obama \"does not understand\" the country's national security challenges. McCain said he knows how to handle foreign affairs and questioned Obama's ability to do so.  Analysts weigh in on the debate \u00bb . \"Sen. Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge. He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia. And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges,\" McCain said. \"We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.\" McCain said the \"challenge\" facing a president considering using military force \"is to know when to go in and when not.\" \"My judgment is something that I think I have a record to stand on,\" McCain said.  Video highlights of key moments \u00bb . Obama shot back and questioned McCain's judgment in supporting the invasion of Iraq. \"When Sen. McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators,\" he said. \"That was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us.\" The candidates spent about 30 minutes of the debate focusing on foreign affairs. They spoke about the economy for about 45 minutes and spent 15 minutes discussing domestic issues.  See scenes from the debate \u00bb . A national poll of debate watchers suggested that Obama won the presidential debate. Post-debate poll . Fifty-four percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released 30 minutes after the end of the debate said that Obama did the best job, while 30 percent said McCain performed better. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone with 675 adult Americans who watched the debate. All interviews were taken after the end of the debate. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. iReport.com: Tell us who you think won round two . At the start of the debate, Obama said the country is in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. He blamed President Bush and McCain for the crisis, saying they had worked to \"strip away regulation.\" Bush: The elephant in the room . McCain said the system in Washington \"cries out for bipartisanship\" and pushed his record as a reformer. He proposed having the government buy up and renegotiate bad home loans to stabilize the property market. He admitted the plan would be expensive but said it was necessary.  Watch McCain talk about his plan for the economy \u00bb . The Arizona senator also hammered away at his rival's tax policies, saying that \"nailing down Sen. Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall.\"  Watch McCain slam Obama's tax plan \u00bb . McCain charged that \"Obama's secret that you don't know\" is that he would increase taxes on small business revenue, which he said would lead to job cuts. Fact check: Did Obama vote 94 times for higher taxes . Obama shot back, saying \"the Straight Talk Express lost a wheel on that one.\" \"Let's be clear about my tax plan and Sen. McCain's,\" he said. \"I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans.\"  Watch Obama talk about his plan for the middle class \u00bb . The candidates talked about their plans to revamp the health care system. Obama said the country has a \"moral commitment as well as an economic imperative\" to address the health care problem. The Illinois senator said health care is a \"crushing burden\" for small businesses and is \"breaking family budgets.\" Obama said health care was a \"right,\" while McCain said it was a \"responsibility.\"  Watch the candidates debate health care \u00bb . Obama and McCain both proposed computerizing medical records to reduce costs and limit errors. Obama's health care plan includes the creation of a national health insurance program for individuals who do not have employer-provided health care and who do not qualify for other existing federal programs. His plan does not mandate individual coverage for all Americans, but requires coverage for all children. McCain opposes federally mandated universal coverage. He believes competition will improve the quality of health insurance. McCain says he would reform the tax code to offer choices beyond employee-based health insurance coverage. McCain argued that Obama's plan included fines for small businesses that did not insure their employees, while his was based on \"choice\" rather than \"mandates.\" Immediately after the debate, Obama's campaign highlighted a moment when McCain sought to criticize Obama for supporting the 2007 Bush-Cheney energy bill: . \"It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate, loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney,\" McCain said. \"You know who voted for it? You might never know. That one. You know who voted against it? Me.\" Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton immediately e-mailed reporters noting McCain's seemingly peculiar reference to the Illinois senator. \"Did John McCain just refer to Obama as 'that one?'\" Burton asked.

Barack Obama's acceptance of the Democratic Party's presidential nomination may be historic in many ways. One of them is the size of the audience at Invesco Field. More than 75,000 people packed into the football stadium in Denver, Colorado, to hear Obama's historic speech as the first African-American Democratic presidential nominee. The enormity of the crowd was borne out by the gridlock that greeted them as they left the stadium.

Hillary Clinton, needing a win in Texas to derail Sen. Barack Obama in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, sought Thursday to contrast her opponent's rhetorical skills with what she called her superior ability to govern. Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton face off in a high-stakes debate. \"I do think that words are important and words matter,\" Clinton said at a debate at the University of Texas. \"But actions speak louder than words.\" Obama responded by laying out issues he's worked on in the Senate and others he'd support as president -- then called it ridiculous to suggest his supporters are \"being duped.\" \"The implication is that the people who have been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional,\" he said. Obama said his supporters perceive the reality of what's going on in Washington very clearly, and they want to see it change. \"What they see is that if we don't bring the country together, stop the endless bickering, actually focus on solutions and reduce the special interests that have dominated Washington, then we will not get anything done.\"  Watch Obama talk about his plan to change Washington \u00bb . Much of the 90-minute debate featured the two candidates staking out similar positions on issues like Iraq, the economy and immigration.  Watch the candidates weigh in on the economy \u00bb . \"It was a very odd debate -- the questioners had to beg them to differ with each other,\" said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider.  See what CNN's political team thought of the showdown \u00bb . The debate was the first the two have participated in since they met in Los Angeles January 31. Five days later, the two effectively split the victories on Super Tuesday. But since then, Obama has rolled to 11 straight wins, a streak that leaves Clinton needing wins in delegate-rich Texas and Ohio on March 4. Vermont and Rhode Island also hold primaries that day. Texas is the biggest prize, with 193 Democratic delegates. Going into those primaries, Obama leads Clinton by 140 pledged delegates. Responding to a question from the panel, Clinton's sharpest attack on Obama came when she went after him for borrowing lines from a speech by Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, his campaign co-chairman, in his own campaign speeches. The Clinton campaign has called that plagiarism. \"If your campaign is going to be about words, they should be your own words,\" she said. \"Lifting whole passages isn't change you can believe in; it's change you can Xerox.\"  Watch the spat over plagiarism \u00bb . Some in the audience booed Clinton for the line. \"This is where we start getting into silly season in politics,\" Obama replied, saying Patrick is a friend who suggested he use the lines. \"People start getting tired of it.\" A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll out Monday suggests the Democratic race in Texas is a statistical dead heat.  Watch uncommitted Texas students discuss debate \u00bb . In the survey, taken before Obama's Tuesday victories in Wisconsin and Hawaii, 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters support Clinton as their choice for the party's nominee, with 48 percent backing Obama. The poll's margin of error is 4.5 percentage points. Two other recent polls also show the race statistically even. With so much at stake, analysts said Clinton needed a very strong performance in the debate, the only time the two candidates will share a stage in Texas before the state's primary. \"Texas is the endgame. Hillary Clinton has to stop Obama in Texas. This means she has to do something to shake the race up. She has to raise doubts about Obama and get Democrats to rethink whether they really want to rally behind him,\" Schneider said. In a state where Hispanic voters are expected to make up a large share of the March 4 electorate, the pair fielded questions on immigration reform and dealing with Cuba's government in the wake of President Fidel Castro's decision this week to step down.  Watch the candidates talk about Cuba \u00bb . Both Clinton and Obama voted to authorize President Bush to build a border fence between the United States and Mexico -- but both said Thursday they would consult with leaders in border areas about where fencing is needed and where other methods could be used to secure the borders.  Watch the candidates debate immigration \u00bb . \"As with so much, the Bush administration has gone off the deep end,\" Clinton said. Both also said they'd be willing to meet with Fidel Castro's brother Raul -- who is expected to become president of Cuba after his brother stepped down -- if the nation's leadership has shown signs of improving its record on human rights, freedom of the press and other issues. Schneider said neither candidate appeared to have gained or lost significant ground in Thursday's debate. After months of campaigning that have included 19 Democratic debates, some analysts said the two may be satisfied to stand on the themes they've established and simply let voters decide.

Mark Warner said Tuesday. \"We need a president who understands the world today, the future we seek and the change we need. We need Barack Obama as the next president of the United States.\" Warner was delivering the keynote speech at the convention, the slot that Obama himself filled four years ago. He accused President Bush of a failure of leadership at a critical moment in the nation's history. \"Folks always ask me, what's my biggest criticism of President Bush? I'm sure you all have your own. Here's mine: It's not just the policy differences. It's the fact that this president never tapped into our greatest resources: the character and resolve of the American people. He never really asked us to step up.\" John McCain, he said, offered only \"a plan that would explode the deficit and leave that to our kids. No real strategy to invest in our infrastructure. And he would continue spending $10 billion a month in Iraq. I don't know about you, but that's just not right. That's four more years that we just can't afford.\"  Watch Warner say McCain is \"more of the same\" \u00bb . But much of his speech was devoted to the kind of bipartisan rhetoric Obama has espoused on the campaign trail. \"I know we're at the Democratic Convention, but if an idea works, it really doesn't matter whether it's got a 'D' or an 'R' next to it. Because this election isn't about liberal vs. conservative. It's not about left vs. right. It's about the future vs. the past. \"That's why we must elect Barack Obama as our next president,\" Warner said. \"Because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas. When we put solutions over stalemates and when hope replaces fear.\"", "ccbe0bfe4609f6a9a58b3ee06ed230871916f877": "DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton introduced herself as a \"proud supporter of Barack Obama\" at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday as she called on her party to rally behind her former rival. Sen. Hillary Clinton, with daughter Chelsea, receives a standing ovation from the Democratic delegates. \"Whether you voted for me, or voted for Barack, the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose. We are on the same team, and none of us can sit on the sidelines. This is a fight for the future. And it's a fight we must win together,\" she said. Leading up to her address, there was a lot of speculation about what she would say and whether she would make a strong enough call for unity. But she made a very strident case for Obama's candidacy. \"No way. No how. No McCain. Barack Obama is my candidate. And he must be our president,\" Clinton said. Her speech, which was the last of the night, followed a line up of other Democrats who used their time at the podium to attack President Bush's record and McCain's policies. Appearing strong and energized, Clinton thanked her voters for supporting her historic campaign as a female candidate and reached out to those wary of Obama by telling them they weren't in this for her, but for her cause. That cause, she said, is the same thing that Obama and the rest of the Democratic Party are fighting for.  Watch Clinton's entire speech \u00bb . Many analysts said the speech would end speculation that Clinton has not fully embraced Obama as her party's candidate. Clinton mentioned Obama by name more than twice as many times as she mentioned the party as a whole.  Analysts weigh in on the night's speakers \u00bb . \"I thought she was a class act,\" said political analyst David Gergen, who worked in the Clinton administration. \"I think it could well be said that nothing has so become her campaign as the way she has ended it here tonight.\" Clinton also praised Obama's newly tapped vice presidential candidate, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware. The former first lady called Biden \"pragmatic, tough and wise.\"  Watch Clinton talk about the Obama-Biden team \u00bb . Clinton was met with a standing ovation from an enthusiastic audience. Only a few pockets of the standing-room only convention center weren't on their feet cheering for her. Observers said she had the biggest reception of the evening. As soon as the speech ended, the McCain campaign issued a statement implying that Clinton did nothing to dispel her previous criticism of Obama. \"Sen. Clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that Barack Obama is not prepared to lead as commander-in-chief. Nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment,\" McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said. \"Nowhere tonight did she say that Barack Obama is ready to lead. Millions of Hillary Clinton supporters and millions of Americans remain concerned about whether Barack Obama is ready to be president.\" The McCain campaign has stepped up its effort to woo disaffected Clinton supporters, running ads highlighting Clinton's criticism of Obama during the primaries. Obama called Clinton after the speech and thanked her for her support and said she could not have done a better job. Earlier, former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner appealed across party lines in his keynote address. Obama has been campaigning hard to win Virginia, which hasn't voted for a Democratic president since President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.  Watch Warner make his case for Obama \u00bb . According to CNN's electoral map, the state is a toss-up going into the general election. In order for Obama to take the state's 13 electoral votes, he would need to win over some of Virginia's independent and Republican voters. Instead of tearing into the current administration, Warner talked about ideas -- highlighting science and technology. \"I know we're at the Democratic convention, but if an idea works, it really doesn't matter if it has an 'R' or 'D' next to it,\" Warner said. \"Because this election isn't about liberal versus conservative. It's not about left versus right. It's about the future versus the past.\" His words echoed Obama's own keynote speech of four years ago when the then little known senator from Illinois spoke of what united rather than divided Americans. In 2004, before John Kerry was nominated for president, Obama said to delegates: \"There is not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United States of America. There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America -- there's the United States of America.\" Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said Warner's address could do for him what Obama's address did four years ago.  Watch Warner's entire speech \u00bb . \"It's a very powerful speech. He's going to come out of this convention the way Barack Obama came out of the last convention -- as the rock star, as the next guy,\" he said. \"It was an important speech because if this election is about experience and strength, McCain wins. But if this election's about the past versus the future, Republicans have a much tougher job.\" Warner's most blunt criticism of President Bush was that he has kept the country from living up to its potential. Tuesday's other speakers played up Obama's message of change and tore into McCain, saying he would only bring about more of the same. Pennsylvania Sen. Robert Casey Jr. at one point feigned shock at the idea that the Republican Party was asking for four more years in the White House, promising the party of President Bush and McCain \"not four more years, but four more months.\" In response, the delegates jumped to their feet shouting, \"Four more months! Four more months!\" Audience members also waved signs that said \"McCain more of the same.\"", "493f1995614acbc9e8cd9959fb0f158940e365ae": "(CNN) -- The biggest challenge was finding an Edward. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart play Edward and Bella in \"Twilight.\" \"The most perfect guy in the world,\" \"Twilight\" director Catherine Hardwicke said, ticking off the characteristics of \"Twilight's\" vampire hero. \"Cannot be Leo [DiCaprio]; cannot be Brad Pitt. They don't fit in high school anymore. And there are a lot of cute guys, but do they really look like they've lived for 108 years?\" Probably not, but with a fan base as large as \"Twilight's,\" Hardwicke had to search for one. And if the thousands of screaming girls who show up at autograph signings are any measure, she found him in Robert Pattinson. The actor, best known for playing Cedric Diggory in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\" has faced mob scenes wherever he's appeared. Fans in Dallas waited overnight in the rain for a chance to see him; an event in San Francisco was delayed because of the crush. Pattinson is still surprised by the reaction. Though things started quietly during filming, by the time production was wrapping, \"there were like 200 people turning up to the set every day,\" he said.  \"And now, if we were trying to shoot it now, it would be absolutely impossible to do anything. Because where ever there's a 'Twilight,' anything mentioned about 'Twilight,' thousands of people turn up.\" \"Twilight's\" many fans -- most of whom will get their first feature-length glimpse of Edward when the film opens with midnight showings Friday -- can't wait for the witching hour. They also haven't been afraid of letting Kristen Stewart, who plays Bella Swan in the film based on Stephenie Meyer's series of books, know about their feelings for \"Twilight\" -- and Edward. Some have been downright disdainful, Stewart told CNN at the Los Angeles interviews for the film. \"Very communicative looks,\" Stewart said. \"Like, 'I'm just letting you know with this look that you're nothing special. ... I'm here for Edward, and I hope you don't ruin the movie.' It's really crazy.\" Stewart doesn't let it bother her, though. She's been focused on  portraying Bella, a clumsy, awkward 17-year-old who moves into a small town that she finds quite boring. Boring, that is, until she meets and falls in love with Edward(Pattinson).  Watch Pattinson greet a line of screaming fans \u00bb . The vampires created by Meyer are different from those of the past. They dress fashionably, have good taste in art and music, and are very much human. \"They are the main characters,\" Stewart said. \"They are the people that you sympathize with. They're not just the villains in the movie.\" Edward is one of the Cullen family of vampires, a clan that has stopped drinking human blood. \"He made his world smaller and smaller so he never killed anybody,\" Pattinson said of his character. \"And he didn't care about anyone else. Imagine, never having an emotion ... and then suddenly this girl comes into your life. As well as breaking down all your self-discipline, which you've had for 80 years, she also makes you feel everything again.\" Edward and Bella must overcome obstacles worthy of \"Romeo and Juliet\" in their relationship. (Besides the differences in her background with Edward, Bella is also stalked by a vampire with fewer scruples than the Cullen boy.) But it's that sexual tension that makes the whole vampire culture so undeniably delicious, Hardwicke said. \"The idea of this incredibly seductive creature wanting to bite your neck,\" she said. \"And if he does, on one level it could be pleasurable. If he goes too far, you could die. That kind of razor's edge, that sexual tension, is incredibly seductive.\" That doesn't mean the film is all lovey-dovey. Hardwicke and the movie's stunt coordinator spent hours trying to figure out how to keep the fight scenes true to Meyer's books. Meyer's vampires can't be killed with stakes or holy water; they have to be ripped limb from limb. And then what's left has to be burned. \"How do you fight when you're trying to pull somebody's arms off or twist their head off?\" Hardwicke asked. \"That makes for a different kind of fight.\" Romance, seduction and violence are all well and good, elements that have fulfilled audience desires for decades. But it's the vampires that give those characteristics an extra edge, whether it's in Bram Stoker's \"Dracula,\" \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" or \"Twilight.\" iReport.com: Are you planning to see 'Twilight'? \"A vampire itself is just such a great template for making a mysterious character,\" Pattinson said. \"They can only come out at night. They have a dark secret, which by vampire law they're not allowed to tell anybody. And the only people who find out, die.\" \"Twilight\" is based on the first of Meyer's now four-book series. So will the movie \"Twilight\" follow in the footsteps of another book series with a huge audience, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter tales? Hardwicke said she doesn't know. \"Stephenie went a little wild [in the sequel] and wrote all these visual effects and werewolves and Italy and everything,\" she said. \"So the next book is going to be a lot more expensive [to make]. But if this one makes enough, then we'll get to do it.\" CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this story.", "a453a783cd7f423053b7e56dc5e81fdeec92c468": "DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- It was classic Clinton. It was Sen. Hillary Clinton's big night but before her speech even began, former President Bill Clinton reached out in his box and firmly embraced a young African-American man. Clinton gripped the young man tightly; to millions watching on television, it was clear he could feel Mervyn Jones Jr.'s pain. As he sat down for his wife's headlining address, Bill Clinton's silent embrace of the 25-year-old son of recently deceased Ohio Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones resonated loudly. Rep. Tubbs Jones, of course, was a solid and loyal Clinton supporter, standing by the Clintons even when many other black leaders were shifting their support to Barack Obama. Then, in her speech, Sen. Clinton herself took a moment to mention Tubbs Jones and her son. \"Steadfast in her beliefs, a fighter of uncommon grace, she was an inspiration to me and to us all,\" Clinton said. \"Our heart goes out to Stephanie's son, Mervyn Jr.\" The public moment of recognition was the result of years of friendship. \" I remember the first time President Clinton ran for office [in 1992],\" Jones Jr. told CNN. \"He came to Cleveland. I must have been 8 years old. \"My mother got the chance to meet him. ... They have been best of friends ever since,\" he said. And, perhaps, it was also a reminder that if you stand by the Clintons, the Clintons will stand by you. Tubbs Jones endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in April 2007 but with Sen. Barack Obama's success during the primaries, many African-American superdelegates came under pressure to back Obama instead. Tubbs Jones, however, held steadfast even as others in her position switched their allegiance. \"I'm going to be with her until she says, 'Stephanie, I'm no longer in this fight. You're free to do something else,'\" Tubbs Jones told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in March. \"In politics, all you have is your word,\" she added. She passed that same sense of commitment on to her son. \"If you give somebody your word, you're going to go ahead and do it,\" Jones Jr. said the day after Hillary Clinton's address to the Democratic National Convention. \"Otherwise, it's not worth anything.\" \"The same goes in politics,\" he added. \"If you don't have your word, you don't really have anything to stand on in politics. So, that's one thing I did learn [from my mother] at a very early age.\" When Sen. Clinton asked Jones Jr. to sit with her husband during what was perhaps her most important speech to date, he agreed. \"She always said that if you don't stick by somebody in the bad times, you never know how good the good times are going to be,\" Jones Jr. said, explaining his mother's view of loyalty. Tubbs Jones, 58, died suddenly a week ago of a brain aneurysm. She was in her fifth term in the House of Representatives and was the first African-American woman to represent Ohio in the House. What would Tubbs Jones have thought of Sen. Clinton's call Tuesday for Democrats to unify behind Obama? \"She would've been standing up, hooting and hollering saying, 'Wow. That's exactly what we needed. Way to be a team player,'\" Jones Jr. said. In what some political analysts were calling the first speech of her second campaign for president, Hillary Clinton did her part on stage. And, in the box, her husband held on tightly to the son of an old friend \u00adand sent a message of his own that may resonate as an important moment in the long-term resurrection of the Clinton brand in American politics.", "a999aa661a4990e6d8423cfdf474e344aaffdc5a": "(CNN) -- Radical Islamist fighters seized control of the seat of Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government Monday, raiding the parliament building and demanding that several lawmakers publicly surrender, according to a journalist who witnessed the spectacle. Members of the Somali Transitional Federal Parliament are meeting in the neighboring country of Djibouti. Al-Shabab fighters took over the parliament building and the presidential palace in Baidoa, in the southwestern part of the country, a day after the Ethiopian troops who had backed up the transitional government left the country. The insurgents captured five members of parliament and paraded them through the city streets, with hundreds of residents looking on, the reporter said. The five were released after publicly surrendering. The situation left Somali lawmakers stranded in the neighboring country of Djibouti, where they often convene and where talks on forming a new government are under way. \"We have nowhere to return to,\" Parliament Speaker Aden Mohamed Nur told fellow lawmakers there. Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government took office after Ethiopian troops invaded the country at its request in December 2006. The Ethiopian invasion ousted the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamist movement that had claimed control of the capital Mogadishu earlier that year. Ethiopia's invasion had the blessing of the United States, which accused the Islamic Courts Union of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda. But various Islamist groups -- including the hard-line Al-Shabab, which the United States has designated a terror organization -- rejected the presence of Ethiopian forces and mounted an insurgent campaign against the Ethiopians and the transitional government. Ethiopia announced on Sunday that all its forces have left Somalia. Last week, as Ethiopian troops began pulling out of the Somali capital, forces from different Islamist groups -- including Al-Shabab -- took control of bases the Ethiopians abandoned around Mogadishu. The transitional government maintained very little control outside of Baidoa, even with the support of the Ethiopian forces. It has also been wracked by an internal power struggle between Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein and President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, who resigned in December. In Washington, the State Department said U.S. officials are working to independently confirm the reports from Baidoa. But State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said members of one of the major Islamic factions, which signed a peace agreement in October in Djibouti, are already joining the transitional government. Duguid said the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, another offshoot of the ICU, will choose up to 200 new members of the transitional parliament. Another 75 members will be drawn from other opposition groups, and the expanded parliament is expected to elect a new president soon. \"We remain deeply concerned about the ongoing violence in southern Somalia, which continues to claim innocent lives,\" Duguid said. \"Lasting peace and stability in Somalia can only be established through the reconciliation process underway through the Djibouti Agreement and rejection of extremism.\" With Monday's takeover of Baidoa, the transitional government only has control of the presidential palace in the Somali capital of Mogadishu and the road to the airport in the capital city, which it holds with the help of African Union forces.

Pfizer's world headquarters is in New York. A deal was imminent and likely to be announced Monday, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported. \"It is our policy not to comment on rumor or speculation,\" said Michael Lampe, a Wyeth representative. Pfizer was not immediately available for comment. Pfizer, the world's leading drugmaker in terms of sales, has been in talks to buy Wyeth. Pfizer's stock slipped 1 percent on the news Friday, while Wyeth gained about 8 percent. On January 13 Pfizer said it was cutting up to 8 percent of its R&D staff, about 800 jobs. Spokesman Raymond Kerins said that was to \"raise productivity.\" But analysts say Pfizer is clearly trying to beef up its drug pipeline through an acquisition, adding that the company seems to have given up on its own R&D staff coming up with a blockbuster to replace Lipitor. This cholesterol-cutting drug peaked in 2006 with nearly $13 billion in annual sales but will lose its patent protection in 2011, when generic versions will become available. Les Funtleyder, pharma analyst for Miller Tabak, said Pfizer is \"not feeling that they're getting the efficiency out of their R&D unit.\" He said Pfizer would probably rather do a deal with Wyeth over other competitors, because there is less overlap in the companies' pipelines. Funtleyder said Pfizer already has a diabetes franchise, which would overlap with Eli Lilly & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb, both of which also focus on diabetes treatments. Pfizer probably has its eyes on Wyeth's Alzheimer's drug pipeline, he said. But he cautions that a merger won't be a success unless Wyeth's pipeline is successful, which remains to be seen, he said. \"If Wyeth comes out with an Alzheimer's drug that works, then the deal works,\" he said.

Rev. Ted Haggard tells Oprah Winfrey he still struggles with homosexual urges but says he is not gay. Haggard told talk show host Oprah Winfrey on Wednesday that the scandal forced him to work through his \"issues\" with homosexuality. \"I was dying. I had settled in my mind exactly how I was going to commit suicide,\" Haggard told Winfrey. \"I was preparing, and in my life, Jesus came to me and he said, 'Now, now I can save you.' \" The interview also addressed the latest scandal involving the embattled pastor. In a statement from Haggard that Winfrey read at the end of the program, Haggard denied having \"physical contact\" with a second man whose allegations of an inappropriate relationship with Haggard surfaced recently.  Watch Haggard's accuser speak out \u00bb . Haggard, who appeared in the prerecorded interview segment with his wife and two of his three children, said he continues to struggle with homosexual urges but insisted he is not gay. Haggard continues to have \"sexual thoughts about men, but they're not compulsive any more, and I do have temptations, but they're not compulsive,\" he told Winfrey. He said one therapist described him as a \"heterosexual with homosexual attachments,\" and he admitted to struggling with homosexual urges all his life. \"I do believe I don't fit into the normal boxes,\" Haggard said. \"I do think there are complexities associated with some people's sexuality, but it just wasn't as simple as I wanted it to be, because I was so deeply in love with my life.\" But, he added, \"I had this other thing going on inside of me too.\" Haggard founded the Colorado-based New Life Church in his basement in 1984 and oversaw its growth to a megachurch with some 15,000 members. After the scandal, he was fired from the church in 2006 and also resigned as president of the National Association of Evangelicals -- a group that says it represents millions of people in 45,000 evangelical church congregations nationwide. His fall followed allegations from male escort Mike Jones about a sex-for-money relationship that involved drugs. \"When it first started to happen, I lied about it because I was so ashamed, and it was the first time that that dark area of my life that I had worked so hard to keep secret and fight against was coming to the surface,\" he told Winfrey. \"I thank God, though, that in this process, I am where I am now and that accusation and the scandal had a lot to do with that,\" he said. The interview aired as Haggard tries to combat the latest allegations. A senior pastor at New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, said Monday that the church agreed to pay the second man -- a 20-year-old church volunteer -- in exchange for his pledge not to talk publicly about the relationship with Haggard. After the taped segment, Winfrey read a statement from Haggard about those new allegations. \"Even though there was never any physical contact, I have regretted my irresponsible behavior,\" Haggard said, referring to allegations from a man he identified as Grant. \"I apologized to Grant, my family and the church two years ago. I now ask him again for his forgiveness as well as the people of the church,\" Haggard said. In the past three weeks, the man told New Life Senior Pastor Brady Boyd that he was considering going public with his story because Haggard was portraying himself as a victim in an upcoming HBO documentary called \"The Trial of Ted Haggard,\" which is scheduled to air Thursday.", "15ca63cf7178906ddff9eb804f7cbf94efd9292f": "(CNN) -- Longtime character actor Pat Hingle, a veteran of early television dramas, Westerns and four \"Batman\" films, has died at age 84, his family announced Sunday. Pat Hingle was a familiar face to moviegoers and TV watchers for his many roles. Hingle died Saturday evening at his home in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, after a two-year battle with the blood disorder myelodysplasia, his cousin, Lynn Heritage, told CNN. \"He was awake one moment, and in the next breath, he was gone,\" Heritage said. Hingle began his acting career in the 1950s, appearing in numerous television theater shows. His first movie role was an uncredited appearance in 1954's \"On the Waterfront,\" which won eight Academy Awards; he played the by-the-book judge opposite Clint Eastwood's vengeful marshal in 1968's \"Hang 'Em High,\" and appeared as Sally Field's father in 1979's \"Norma Rae.\" In 1989, he appeared as Gotham City's Commissioner Gordon in Tim Burton's \"Batman,\" carrying on the role through three sequels.

Sri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka says a key Tamil town has been taken in a national TV broadcast Sunday. Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency. \"Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track,\" Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address on Sunday. \"This is the long awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years,\" the Sri Lanka Army chief said. There is no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead. The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government. In recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds. Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula. It had been in rebel hands for more than nine years. The re-capture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea. \"The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally,\" Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. \"They lost... about 90 percent of what they had.\" Despite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict. \"This is an important strategic success for the army, but literally tens of thousands of people, children, are in the line of fire,\" United Nations spokesman James Elder said in a phone conversation Sunday. \"Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there,\" he added. \"Convoys are going to the area, delivering emergency supplies, but these are not sufficient for the number of people in need.\" Sri Lankan authorities are barring journalists and humanitarian aid workers from areas where heavy fighting is taking place. Amnesty International spokesman Shuransu Mishra estimated that \"over a quarter of a million of the population, mostly Tamils, are trapped between the two sides.\" The organization says greater access and protection for aid workers and journalists are needed as news agencies struggle to report an accurate picture of the conflict. \"The Sri Lankan authorities are doing little to ensure the safety of the country's media, or to prosecute those responsible for murdering or attacking them,\" Amnesty International spokeswoman Yolanda Foster said in a written statement on Friday. \"They (Sri Lankan authorities) are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation,\" she said. At least 14 journalists have been killed since the start of 2006, according to the statement. Others have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.", "dbfccb9f0f6de53af9b2fd0f0f984d0fb5ca3efc": "(CNN) -- When John Lennon remarked in 1966 that the Beatles were then \"more popular than Jesus\" his comments prompted outrage in the United States. But this weekend the Vatican's newspaper paid tribute to the band on the 40th anniversary of the release of the \"White Album\" in an article interpreted by some as a papal pardon for Lennon. John Lennon appears with wife Yoko Ono in 1968, two years after he made his \"more popular than Jesus\" comments. CNN's Alessio Vinci spoke to Steve Turner, author \"The Gospel According To The Beatles,\" about the controversy that helped to end the Beatles' touring career. Q: Was Lennon surprised by the storm his comment generated? A: I think John Lennon was surprised because it had been said in a casual way to a journalist who was a personal friend of his and he had no idea it would cause that sort of controversy. When it did happen he was actually quite frightened because they were about to go off on tour and there were these threats to their lives and a clairvoyant made some predictions that their plane would crash. It was really quite frightening and they wanted to cancel the tour but they knew they couldn't. They were under obligation to the tour promoters. And when he made his apology in Chicago, (the band's) press officer told me that John was actually in tears before he went in to make the apology. Q: Was his apology sincere?  Watch as Vatican pardons Lennon \u00bb . A: His apology was very carefully worded. He never said \"I didn't mean that;\" he kind of said, \"if it was taken that way, that's not what I meant,\" but he never actually retracted it. The reason it happened that way, in America particularly, is that people thought the Beatles were getting too big, too proud and it was a way of putting them down and I think people grabbed that opportunity. Q: Did they care at all what the Vatican newspaper had to say at the time? A: I don't know that the Beatles had any particular concern about what the Vatican said. I know the Vatican did say something at the time. But by that time, everybody was pitching in with their opinion, and it just kind of gathered pace. Q: If he were alive, what would he say about his \"rehabilitation?\" A: It's very hard to say what John Lennon would say now if he knew that the pope had forgiven him or the Catholic Church had forgiven him because on the one hand he wrote to an American evangelist called Oral Roberts and said he had been very sorry. But in a book he said he was very glad that it had happened because it effectively ended the Beatles. Because that tour was so bad that it became the last tour the Beatles ever did. So he thought, \"Thank you Jesus for causing this to happen -- because you gave me a solo career.\" Q: How spiritual were the Beatles? A: The Beatles started out as atheists and agnostics and I think as everybody knows they became more interested in spiritual things. They went out to India in 1968 and I think in a way the Beatles became a spiritual force themselves. And I think that John actually saw that. He saw Christianity and rock 'n' roll as competitors. Only three years later, after 1966, you had the Woodstock festival and you get rock music almost performing a religious function. So I think in a way he was aware of what was happening. The Beatles were almost becoming a religion and exerting a spiritual force over people.", "f6a0aebb193a6bcf3894d0dbd2b7a06a73325e8e": "(CNN)  -- A man walks into a thrift store. A New Zealand man finds confidential U.S. military files on a used MP3 player he bought at a thrift store for $9. It sounds like the opening line to a bad joke. And this case was a bad joke -- for the Pentagon. Chris Ogle of New Zealand was in Oklahoma about a year ago when he bought a used MP3 player from a thrift store for $9. A few weeks ago, he plugged it into his computer to download a song, and he instead discovered confidential U.S. military files. \"The more I look at it, the more I see, and the less I think I should be,\" Ogle said with a nervous laugh in an interview with TVNZ. The files included the home addresses, Social Security numbers and cell phone numbers of U.S. soldiers. The player also included what appeared to be mission briefings and lists of equipment deployed to hot spots in Afghanistan and Iraq. Most of the information appears to date to 2005. The New Zealand journalist who first reported the story was able to contact at least one of the soldiers by dialing a phone number found in the files. He hung up once she explained why she was calling.  Watch how man discovered secret military files \u00bb . Pentagon officials told CNN that they are aware of the MP3 player, but can't talk about it until investigators confirm that the information came from the U.S. Department of Defense. \"The government isn't doing a good job of protecting the information that it collects,\" said Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. Despite government efforts to protect sensitive information, this is a growing problem, privacy experts say. Two years ago, the Department of Veterans Affairs lost track of a laptop with the personal information of millions of soldiers. And computer hard drives with classified military information have been found for sale at street markets in Afghanistan. \"When you can identify American personnel, when you have their names, their home address, their cell phone numbers, you put people in a dangerous position,\" Rotenberg said. In this case, the personal information for several hundred soldiers landed in friendly hands. Ogle told CNN the MP3 player is being kept in a safe place and he will happily turn it over to U.S. military officials if they ask for it.", "5dbf33ee3441e17e641288fa7476525d5072e7be": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- A suspect in police custody calls himself a \"stewmaker\" for a Mexican drug lord, saying he disposed of about 300 bodies by dissolving them in acid. Santiago Meza Lopez has asked for forgiveness from the families of those he says he targeted. Santiago Meza Lopez was arrested Thursday in Ensenada, Baja California, but it took police 24 hours to identify him. He says he works for drug lord Teodoro Garcia Simental, also known as \"el Teo,\" a powerful drug trafficker. Meza, who is shown handcuffed and flanked by guards in video released by the government, calls himself \"Teo's stewmaker\" and says he was paid $600 a week for his macabre duties. The victims, he said, were men who owed Garcia something or had betrayed him. A native of Guamuchil, Sinaloa, Meza was arrested along with three other people, including a minor female who said she was contracted for a social event. Other people sought by police were in the area at the time but were able to escape, officials said. Now, Meza is asking for forgiveness. \"To the families, please forgive me,\" he said in the video. Mexican police have not specifically said whether they believe that all elements of Meza's story are credible. He has told police where he buried some of the bodies. Now authorities, along with citizens groups and the families of the disappeared, are searching for them. They hope Meza could have information about the location of their friends and relatives. Authorities say Garcia formed part of the Arellano Felix cartel but is currently said by intelligence sources to be operating with the Sinaloa cartel. Officials say seven brothers and four sisters of the Arellano-Felix family inherited the Tijuana, Mexico-based drug cartel from Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo in 1989, after his arrest for drug trafficking. Today, the notorious cartel is split into two factions that have engaged in brutal fighting that has accounted for nearly all the violence in Tijuana, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. More than 400 people were killed last year in drug-related violence. Eduardo Arellano-Felix, who police said was the last remaining brother to have an active role in the cartel, was arrested in October.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs delivered keynote addresses in September 2008, left, and in October 2005, right. Addressing the \"Apple Community\" in a statement, Jobs said his doctors think they have found the reason behind his weight loss: \"a hormone imbalance that has been 'robbing' me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy. Sophisticated blood tests have confirmed this diagnosis.\" But doctors unaffiliated with Jobs' care say this \"hormone imbalance\" could be a symptom of a slew of underlying conditions, including cancer or diabetes. However, any diagnosis based on this description and Jobs' cancer history is purely speculative, experts say. Based on Jobs' history of gastrointestinal problems, it's possible his gastrointestinal system either isn't absorbing proteins or is losing proteins, said Dr. Kenneth Burman, director of Endocrinology at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, who is not involved in caring for Jobs. \"I suspect he's referring to his gastrointestinal system and some of the hormones related to that, rather than more classic endocrine hormones,\" which are associated with the thyroid, adrenal or pituitary glands, Burman said. While abnormalities related to those hormones may also lead to weight loss, they are not necessarily associated with pancreatic disease, he said. There is not enough information available to say how severe a gastrointestinal hormonal problem would be, he said. Others speculate the hormonal issue could relate to his cancer. Dr. Jeffrey Mechanick, clinical professor at Mount Sinai Medical Center, said a tumor in the pancreas would typically create an overproduction of hormones. Glucagon, a hormone produced in the pancreas, would lead to weight loss if produced in excess. \"In a patient whom a few years ago had pancreatic cancer, then progressive weight loss, then develops complications from the weight loss, it would be logical to associate his symptoms now with the previous cancer,\" he said. But the weight loss is not necessarily cancer-related, and Jobs' statement suggests that it's not, said Dr. Andrew Lowy, chief of the division of surgical oncology at the University of California, San Diego's Moores Cancer Center. Plenty of hormonal conditions, as well as diabetes related to cancer treatment, could be the reason, he said. Jobs, who co-founded Apple Inc., first learned he had pancreatic cancer in October 2003. He had been getting abdominal scans because of a history of intestinal problems, and a tumor appeared on one of them, Fortune reported last year. The growth was an islet cell neuroendocrine tumor, a rare form of pancreatic cancer that is operable, Fortune reported. While Jobs initially wanted to treat the tumor with a special diet and alternative therapies, he finally underwent a Whipple procedure, a painful but relatively safe operation, in July 2004, Fortune reported. If Jobs had a recurrence of this tumor, and it was a functional neuroendocrine tumor, which produces problem-causing hormones, that would be one speculative explanation, Lowy said. But not enough information is available to say whether the tumor was the functional kind, he said. \"Is it possible that a cancer recurrence would result in weight loss? Of course. He's saying that's not what he has, and so, I have to take him at his word. None of us know the truth except his doctors,\" Lowy said. Rumors about Jobs' declining health have been circulating for months, as his weight visibly dropped from one public appearance to the next. While Jobs' keynote address at the Macworld Conference & Expo is usually the highlight of the Apple fan gathering, Apple announced in December Jobs would not appear this year and the company would no longer participate in the event after 2009.

Diesel prices averaged $2.93 on Friday, slumping under $3 for the first time since September 2007, she said.

Watch thrilled customers enjoy cheaper gas \u00bb . \"Crude oil remains [the] main driver,\" for the decline, she said, noting that crude oil futures settled on Friday below $50.

Malcolm Gladwell tries to find out why some people are successful in his new book, \"Outliers.\" Malcolm Gladwell, the New Yorker writer who's made a living dissecting questions such as how small trends become major movements (\"The Tipping Point\") and the value of snap judgments (\"Blink\"), was curious about that subject, and -- typically -- set out to find some answers. The result is his new book \"Outliers\" (Little, Brown), which finds parallels between the Beatles, Bill Gates and Canadian hockey players -- as well as reasons why planes operated by members of particular cultures have a greater likelihood of crashing. John Roberts of CNN's \"American Morning\" spoke to Gladwell on Friday. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: We always think that it's the smartest people that become the most successful. You postulate in this new book [that] it's not always intelligence that leads to success. You say \"it's not the brightest who succeed, it's rather a gift. Outliers are those given opportunities who have the strength and presence of mind to seize them.\" But there are also some commonalities with these outliers. Malcolm Gladwell: Yes. I'm really interested in things like the effects of generation. So what does it mean? I have a chapter that looks at some of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley. And almost all of them are born in 1955: Steve Jobs at Apple, Bill Gates at Microsoft, Bill Joy -- who is one of those famous programmers -- a bunch of guys at Sun Microsystems. The argument there is that they were 21 when the computer revolution hit, and that's how old you want to be when you're confronted with a new revolution. That's the kind of pattern that you see, over and over again, when you look at the lives of very successful people. That it's not just their own abilities, it's being in the right place at the right time, it's coming from a certain kind of culture, it's having certain built-in advantages. CNN: There were also some happy accidents along the way. For example, if Bill Gates hadn't been put into a private school, which actually had a computer -- one of the first schools to ever have a computer -- perhaps he may not have become the mogul that he was. Gladwell: Yes, he has this incredible childhood. ... I talked to him, and he was going through the extraordinary one-in-a-million lucky breaks that characterized his childhood. He got to start programming on a computer in 1968 as a 13-year-old when nobody was programming. So he was way ahead of the crowd by the time he starts Microsoft. CNN: You and I both lived in Canada, developed a love for Canadian hockey, and you found by looking at Canadian hockey teams that there's a certain commonality between all of the best players, at least in the junior hockey league system, which I imagine translates to the pros as well. Gladwell: Oh, absolutely. An extraordinary number of hockey players who are professionals are born in January, February and March. And that's because the cutoff date for age-class hockey is January 1st. So when they go to ... recruit kids for all-star teams when they're 8 or 9 years old, they think they're choosing the most talented ones, but actually they're choosing the biggest ones. Because if you're born in January and you're 8, you're a lot taller, more mature and taller and bigger and stronger than someone born in December. CNN: Because development is much faster there -- . Gladwell: At that age, and so that advantage you get as an 8-year-old, you get plucked out and given proper coaching and more games and more practice -- and by the time you're 18, you actually are better. CNN: Another fascinating finding is that you are more likely to be in a plane crash if the pilot comes from a particular country. What's that all about? Gladwell: Yes. That's a fascinating thing. The single most important variable in determining whether a plane crashes is not the plane, it's not the maintenance, it's not the weather, it's the culture the pilot comes from. Planes are flown safely when the pilot and co-pilot are in open and honest communication. And in cultures where it is difficult for a junior person to speak openly to a superior, you have lots of plane crashes. CNN: And you said the Avianca crash here in [New York's] Oyster Bay ... is a very clear example of that. Gladwell: Where the co-pilot was so intimidated by air traffic control, he could not tell them they were running out of fuel, and they crashed. They just go around and crashed. CNN: Some of the ideas of this book were criticized by The New York Times, which said the book \"is glib, poorly reasoned, thoroughly unconvincing. Much of what Mr. Gladwell has to say about superstars is little more than common sense: that talent alone is not enough to assure success, that opportunity, hard work, timing and luck play important roles as well.\" What do you say about that? Gladwell: I don't think -- I start from a very common-sense premise, but it takes you in all kinds of interesting areas. I wouldn't say that you know the stuff about pilots, the stuff about hockey players being born in January, it doesn't sound like common sense to me. So you know, I think what's interesting about this book is I take a series of ideas which we all know, and then I say, look, it's more complicated and more interesting and more fascinating than we would have ever imagined. CNN: Anything we can do to try to employ some of these techniques? Gladwell: Well, the end of the book talks about what we should be doing as a country. It's less about what we can do. When we understand that success is so much a part of the world of which we're a part, we move away from this idea that's about self-help and we move towards this idea that it's time for us to be providing opportunities to a group.", "2f0e64b4a983b4d6063c541bbe99743b8224e144": "MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Miami police issued a plea for information Saturday after at least one person with an assault rifle opened fire on a crowd of people on a streetcorner Friday night, killing two teens and wounding seven other people.

Blagojevich did say he looked forward to calling witnesses -- including White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel; Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois; and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- who had conversations with him about who should replace Barack Obama as the junior senator from Illinois. Blagojevich maintained the goal of the conversations was to get the best senator for the people of Illinois. \"There was a lot of exchanging of ideas, asking questions, exploring options -- including Oprah Winfrey -- but never, not ever did I have any intention of violating any criminal law,\" Blagojevich said. \"Never was this about selling any Senate seat for any kind of personal gain.\" On both of his ABC appearances and on CNN, Blagojevich explained why talk-show host Oprah Winfrey was a contender to fill Barack Obama's former Senate seat. \"I was trying to think outside of the box. The idea came to me from a friend who suggested Oprah -- it wasn't my idea,\" Blagojevich told CNN. \"I threw it around in conversation with senior staff and political advisers, who were all involved in this whole adventure we're on. \"And among the things we talked about was the, you know, the unlikelihood she would be interested in it, because she has a bully pulpit that's worldwide and more influence that U.S. senators combined -- all 100 of them.\" Winfrey said that she had no idea she was under consideration. She said she found out from best friend Gayle King, who called to tell her on Monday morning.  Watch Oprah's reaction \u00bb . Winfrey said she was \"amused by the whole thing\" but would have turned down the proposal had it been made. Blagojevich also said he was worried about how to present the offer to Winfrey without it looking like a gimmick. The governor said the talks never got to that point \"partly because I was interrupted on December 9.\" Blagojevich and his chief of staff were arrested then on federal corruption charges, including allegations that the governor tried to trade or sell the Senate seat that became vacant after Obama was elected president. Blagojevich ended up picking former Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris to replace Obama. iReport.com: Share your questions for Blagojevich . The governor's impeachment trial began Monday in the Illinois Senate. The Illinois House of Representatives impeached him earlier this month. Blagojevich has denied any wrongdoing. A 76-page criminal complaint against Blagojevich includes snippets of intercepted phone calls involving the governor's alleged efforts to benefit from the Senate vacancy. Those conversations are laced with expletives. Asked on \"Larry King Live\" about his foul mouth, Blagojevich said, \"Had I known someone was listening, I wouldn't have used language like that. For those who might have been offended, I apologize. Again, I didn't know you were listening.\" He also defended his wife, Patti, saying he takes responsibility for any recordings of her using foul language because he may have rubbed off on her. \"I was raised in a big city in a tough neighborhood, and when you're a kid growing up in a neighborhood like that, you would never say words like that in front of your mother. But when you're out there at the schoolyard ... it's just sort of the thing you do,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, you try to get rid of some of those habits; you may have left the neighborhood, but part of that neighborhood never left you.\" In each of his media appearances Monday, Blagojevich maintained his innocence. He said the impeachment proceedings are unfair because he is unable to call witnesses. The governor said he is the victim of political enemies who want to raise taxes in Illinois. Asked by \"The View's\" Barbara Walters why he doesn't step down for the sake of his state and his dignity, Blagojevich said resigning would be \"the worst thing I could do.\" \"I'm an innocent man who has not done anything wrong. And when you're wrongfully accused and you're not given the chance to properly defend yourself ... for me to resign would be to admit that I did something wrong, which I did not do.\" Blagojevich said resigning also would be a way for him to \"disgrace\" his children. iReport: Your questions for the governor . \"So I'm going to fight to the finish because there's a bigger principle here and it's this: Can a legislature take out a governor elected by the people two times without giving that governor a chance to confront witnesses, bring witnesses in and prove his innocence? That's what they are doing in Illinois, and that's why I'm here in New York -- because this is much bigger than me or Illinois.\"", "c882759effb2f675aeec5a172f9fe5aafd3ab665": "(CNN) -- A U.N. official said Monday that the global economic crisis is hurting efforts to clear land mines in Afghanistan, one of the world's most heavily mined countries. An Afghan soldier inspects a land mine in Herat, western Afghanistan. Haider Reza, program director of the U.N. Mine Action Center for Afghanistan, said more than 82,000 anti-personnel mines were cleared in Afghanistan last year. But he said the $500 million needed to meet the goal of clearing all mines by 2013 is under threat. \"We are at a very critical point, and this country and people cannot afford to see a devastating situation where not much money will come,\" Reza said, in remarks included in a U.N. news release. More than 4 million people live in \"mine-contaminated\" areas in Afghanistan, the U.N. says. The clearance of explosives is considered of key importance for the country's development. The anti-personnel mines and 900 anti-tank mines cleared this past year constitute more than 20 percent of mines cleared from the country since 1989, the United Nations said. The Ottawa Convention on land mines specifies that Afghanistan must be completely cleared of mines and unexploded ordnance by 2013. The Afghanistan Compact, the partnership between the Afghan government and the international community, is calling for \"70 percent of explosive-infested land to be cleared by 2011.\" \"If the resources flow into the program, we have the technical capacity and we can do the job,\" said Reza, who is reaching out to new donors, such as Persian Gulf nations. \"God forbid that the security situation throughout the country, especially in areas where we have to do the job, deteriorates to the extent that would not allow our de-miners to do their job.

Alaska's Mount Redoubt volcano spews ash and steam during an eruption in 1989. \"The level of seismic activity\" has \"increased markedly\" in recent days at the 10,197-foot peak located about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage, the state's most populous city, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory. \"We don't have a crystal ball,\" said Peter Cervelli, a research geophysicist with the observatory, which is aggressively monitoring the volcano. But \"we expect based on the past behavior of this volcano that this activity is going to culminate in an eruption.\" The activity has consisted \"of a combination of discrete, relatively small earthquakes and periods of more continuous volcanic tremor,\" Cervelli said. Scientists raised the alert status Sunday to a \"watch\" level, the second-highest, based on seismic activity detected January 23. PopSci.com: Predicting eruptions . The \"watch\" status means the \"volcano is exhibiting heightened or escalating unrest with increased potential of eruption, time frame uncertain, or eruption is under way but poses limited hazards,\" according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

She has lupus and her kidneys continue to fail. Lorna Irungu, 35, had to travel from Kenya to India to receive her third kidney transplant. \"At some point I just wanted it to be over,\" said Irungu, 35. \"I was just tired. I was really, really tired of the fighting, of the struggling, of being sick.\" But Irungu did decide to fight, with the help of a very giving family. Three times she has needed a kidney transplant, and three times her family members insisted on donating. First her father donated, then her sister, and then her brother. Irungu says what she couldn't find was a doctor who would do the tricky third transplant in her own country of Kenya. When she checked in neighboring countries, the cost was impossibly high. Irungu, who's single and has no children, has no insurance. So the former television host was paying for the surgery and medicines out of her own pocket. \"When we looked at the price of getting things done in South Africa. I'm like, 'We're never gonna get there.' It's $45,000. Where do I even begin?\" The cost of a kidney transplant in the United States can be $25,000 to $150,000, also out of Irungu's price range.  Watch more on Lorna Irungu's odyssey \u00bb . So she began looking elsewhere, sending out e-mails and making phone calls to hospitals in other countries. Doctors at Fortis Hospital in New Delhi, India, were the only ones who responded to her somewhat complicated case. Dr. Vijay Kher, the hospital's director of nephrology, first talked to Irungu by phone. \"When she called me from Kenya, she was very sick,\" Kher said. \"She had uncontrolled blood pressures, and she was having fever. She had been in ICU for about three weeks.\" But Irungu made it to India. Once her condition was stabilized, doctors performed the third transplant, which is a rare operation in India. Of the 1,500 kidney transplants performed at Fortis Hospital, doctors remember having done only two in which the patient was having a third transplant. Doctors had to remove one of the previously transplanted kidneys to make room for the new kidney, Kher said. Doctors said it was unnecessary to remove the three other kidneys because they were not causing harm and they didn't want to subject her to more surgery than was necessary. Even with the complications that can arise during a third transplant, the cost of it and the weeklong hospital stay in India came to about $8,000. It's a fraction of the price she was quoted elsewhere, as is the cost of the post-transplant medication. \"This last surgery, I keep saying, has been remarkable.\" Irungu said. \"I haven't felt as good post transplant as I did this time around.\" After three months in India, Irungu is leaving with four kidneys inside her. Irungu says for now the newly transplanted kidney seems to be working great. \"From my experience, the cost here and the quality of care is worth it,\" Irungu said. \"It's worth it because instead of you sitting wherever you are, thinking, 'This is the end for me,' or just getting depressed or getting into this struggle,  (you can) just pack up and go.\"", "ae8e756e2e91fbbbf0d720cc17db980e812a5c70": "(CNN) -- A bus carrying Chinese tourists overturned Friday near Hoover Dam, killing at least seven people and injuring at least nine, an Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman said.

A woman walks past the Haut de la Garenne children's home. Spokeswoman Louise Nibbs said the man was helping authorities with their inquiries into \"a number of historic rapes and indecent assaults.\" But, Nibbs added, the man's detention was not \"directly related\" to the Haut de la Garenne children's home. Rather, he is part of a wider inquiry into abuses that authorities are investigating, she said. \"We can now also confirm that the alleged offenses in question took place in the 1960s and 1970s,\" she said. \"We are not able to say at this time where the offenses took place.\" Nibbs did not release the man's name or disclose any other details. The man has not been charged with a crime, Nibbs said. Jersey is a British crown dependency, located 14 miles off the coast of Normandy near France. In January, police arrested another man -- a former warden who was charged with three counts of indecent assault on underage girls in the late 60s and early 70s. The man, 76-year-old Gordon Wateridge, has not entered a plea yet, Nibbs said. The announcement in January that fragments of a child's skull had been discovered under a stairwell in the building has sparked more than 160 allegations of child abuse there dating back to the 1960s, authorities say. The building opened in 1867 and housed up to 60 children at any one time. It underwent several renovations and closed in 1986 only to reopen as a youth hostel in 2004. Possible clues to the abuse alleged to have occurred inside include writing found on a wall that \"refers to somebody being bad,\" Jersey Deputy Police Chief Lenny Harper said in February. \"We have no idea at the moment who put it there or, indeed, how long it's been there.\" Police said much of what they found, including shackles, matches accounts given by witnesses. Several former residents allege they suffered physical and sexual abuse in a storeroom. Police suspect there could be four bricked-up chambers underground. Several alleged victims have talked about abuse occurring in a large concrete trough in the basement, which was originally the first floor of the building. In February, authorities said they had compiled \"well over 40\" suspects who are alive, and a number of others who are dead. The investigation has taken officials to Australia, Thailand, Germany and the British mainland. Some of those who have reported abuse have taken their complaints to the news media. \"There was one occasion, in the sick bay, where I was made to fondle another boy -- if you didn't, you were threatened you wouldn't come out alive,\" said Carl Denning, who said he was taken to the home at the age of 5 and said one of his friends committed suicide after being raped there. \"You'd go to bed at night, sleeping, and all of a sudden your arms would be held down and the next thing you know you're getting raped,\" recalled Peter Hannaford, who spent the first 12 years of his life there. \"You were subject to constant abuse. ... It was every night, and you were scared to go to bed.\" Stuart Syvret, a local politician, told CNN the building had long been known \"as a place where young boys were punished severely, where they suffered.\" He alleged a \"long-established culture of covering up alleged abuses\" -- a claim the local government denies. The investigation began in 2006, when police were alerted to the possibility that pedophiles had worked at the institution. That led to the discovery of the skull fragment. The institution housed wards of the state -- primarily neglected and abandoned children. A remand wing housed children who had been convicted of crimes. The allegations mar the carefully cultivated image the island's elite have tried to project. Jersey's beaches have made it a big tourist destination, and its offshore banks have made it a tax haven and a playground for the rich. Eleven miles long and 9 miles wide, the island is populated by about 80,000 mostly white, affluent residents. Heavily influenced by the French, the largely autonomous island has its own legal system and its own currency. London manages only its defense and foreign policy matters.

The stimulus bill now moves to the Senate, where GOP members want less spending and more tax cuts. In fact, 11 Democrats also voted against the $819 billion package. But a win is a win, and so the White House strategy is to take the long view: Maybe the Senate will take out more of the controversial pork projects and tweak the tax cuts to win over more Republicans. The full Senate will vote on its version next week. Should the Senate and House pass different versions, the two bills would have to be conferenced together. Then both chambers would have to vote on the new conference version in the coming weeks.  Watch what's next for the stimulus \u00bb . \"I do think it is so important that we slow this bill down in order to do it right,\" said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. Senate GOP sources report that there is a \"real split\" in the GOP caucus about the best way to proceed in the wake of Wednesday's vote in the House. The sources say Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, wants a \"smaller, narrower\" bill. Another group of Republicans including Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is working to craft a larger package that would include more infrastructure spending. Generally, the sources say, the party is looking for more concessions from the White House on spending. The Senate has already made some changes in its version of the bill, which is approaching $900 billion. The Senate Finance Committee added about $70 billion to fix the Alternative Minimum Tax, which was intended to place a tax on the wealthy but now hits many middle class families. The Senate bill adds more direct money for seniors, with a plan to send $300 checks to social security recipients and disabled veterans. Smaller changes in the Senate version include $108 million to extend worker retraining programs and a provision to block any taxes on the first $2,400 of unemployment benefits. Aides say housing relief is also going to be a big issue for some Republican senators. The main concerns are similar to those of their House counterparts. They want more tax cuts and less spending. \"We look forward to offering amendments to improve this critical legislation and move it back to the package President Obama originally proposed -- 40 percent tax relief, no wasteful spending and a bipartisan approach,\" McConnell said. Obama has made it clear that he's not willing to budge on some of the big ticket items, like how the tax cuts are structured. The version passed in the House is two-thirds spending and one-third tax cuts. Much of the $550 billion in spending is divided among these areas: $142 billion for education, $111 billion for health care, $90 billion for infrastructure, $72 billion for aid and benefits, $54 billion for energy, $16 billion for science and technology and $13 billion for housing. Those opposed to the bill say it includes too much wasteful spending, pointing to things like $335 million in funding for education on sexually transmitted diseases and $650 million for digital TV coupons.  Watch why some say there's too much pork \u00bb . A growing number of Republicans and Democrats say measures such as those don't create jobs. The Democratic rationale is that healthier Americans will be more productive. And on the millions for digital television coupons, the hope is that money will go to new call centers explaining how the technology works. \"There's something in there for literally every interest. It's a pent-up wish list of spending programs that many around here have wanted to implement for a really long time,\" said Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota. Congressional leaders did drop some of the controversial provisions, like one that provided $200 million worth of contraceptives to low-income families. Obama personally called some House Democratic leaders to urge them to remove the family planning provision in hopes of winning bipartisan support. The White House is hoping that some Republicans will come on board in the Senate, where there already has been a little more compromise and a greater sense of bipartisanship. Some House Republicans have left the door open to being more receptive to changes made on the Senate side, and then perhaps voting yes if they get those changes when the final bill comes up for a vote. David Gergen, a senior political analyst for CNN, said that while there will be disagreements, some version will likely pass in the coming weeks. \"I think both sides are approaching this with some qualms, but they also feel -- especially the Democrats feel -- they have no choice. The economy is in urgent need to be addressed with a stimulus package,\" he said. \"We have got a very popular president. They're going to support him and go forward. And this package is going to pass. A version of this package is going to pass here in the next two or three weeks.\" The president hopes to have the plan passed by Congress and on his desk for signing by mid-February.

An Iraqi casts his vote Saturday in Ramadi. Preliminary results are expected in a week. \"There is a new norm of politics. ... It is truly a proud moment,\" Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh told CNN. \"The distance that we have come is truly inspiring.\" Faraj al-Haidari, who chairs the Independent High Electoral Commission of Iraq, and Staffan de Mistura, special U.N. representative for Iraq, issued statements saying the election went smoothly. \"Hundreds of thousands of IHEC staff worked dutifully according to procedures,\" said Mistura, who also said he was pleased at the number of women who turned out to vote. Preliminary results from the electoral commission are expected within five days, de Mistura said. Final numbers are due at the end of February. \"Some security incidents were reported during the day, but we didn't have any confirmation on serious security incidents that might effect the total electoral process,\" al-Haidari said. President Obama congratulated the Iraqis on the elections. \"Millions of Iraqi citizens from every ethnic and religious group went peacefully to the polls across the country to choose new provincial councils,\" Obama said in a statement released by the White House. \"It is important that the councils get seated, select new governors and begin work on behalf of the Iraqi people who elected them.\" He said the United States \"is proud to have provided technical assistance, along with the United Nations and other international organizations, to Iraq's Independent High Electoral Commission, which performed professionally under difficult circumstances.\" CNN's Arwa Damon, who toured polling stations with UN observers, said she noticed an increased sense of awareness and optimism among voters, who felt that their participation would have an impact on their lives and country.  Watch Iraqis head to polls \u00bb . Political analysts said this election could correct some of the political imbalances that resulted from the 2005 election. Saturday's voting also was seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. \"We are trying to build a new system of government in the heart of the Islamic Middle East,\" Saleh said. The last provincial elections were in January 2005, after the ousting of Saddam Hussein, and most Sunnis did not vote. \"This time, happening four years after the first elections, means that this process is on track to building a functioning democracy,\" Saleh said. \"I think the election results will point to the real political map of Iraq. \"The overwhelming majority of the people of Iraq are having a stake in this process, are buying into this democratic process.\" He added that politics \"is no longer defined by violence\" and is now transcending \"sectarian and ethnic dimensions.\" Voting was extended by one hour, partly because a curfew had been lifted, allowing more Iraqis to go to the polls, said Judge Qassim al-Aboudi, a member of the Electoral Commission. He described turnout as \"good.\" Those elected will have regional power over the essentials Iraqis have been desperate for: basic services and jobs, Damon reported. She said there was a sense of jubilation in Anbar province, the Sunni heartland west of Baghdad. The sprawling desert area was dominated largely by al Qaeda in January 2005, when the first provincial elections after the fall of Hussein were held. In 2005, fearing retribution from the terrorist group, only about 2 percent of eligible voters cast ballots. In Najaf, the Shiite center south of Baghdad, voters also were eager to let their voices be heard, Damon said.  Watch Arwa Damon on the importance of these elections \u00bb . At a polling station in Baghdad, 80-year-old Ibrahim Saleh, a retired lawyer, said this election \"is completely different from previous elections.\" When asked how, he replied, \"because it is open for all the society components to express their opinion freely.\" Asked what she expects from her candidate, a woman in Diyala, northeast of Baghdad, said, \"we hope stability and security and employment.\" Observers believe that the provincial vote will be a gauge of the country's political direction and a guide to how to the parliamentary elections will turn out this year. The results should spell out the status of the Sunni \"awakening\" movement and the popularity of the Shiite factions, such as those backing al-Maliki, cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. There were tough security measures in place throughout the country, including security rings around polling centers and vigorous searches of voters. Nevertheless, three mortars exploded near a polling station in central Tikrit, about 100 miles north of Baghdad, Saturday morning, an official with the Interior Ministry said. There were no casualties. Police also detained four people wearing Iraqi police uniforms who they said had thrown stun grenades at voters outside a polling center in Tikrit, Saddam's hometown. Al-Maliki cast his ballot in Baghdad's Al-Rasheed Hotel, in the highly protected and fortified International Zone. He told reporters at the polling station that the election is evidence that Iraqi people live under a high level of safety. In Anbar province, Iraqi police and army troops lined the streets of downtown Ramadi. One of the police officers said he was proud to be working on election day. \"\"Let the people see us standing here,\" he said. Police vehicles blasted music outside, creating a festive atmosphere.

Sure, you have drinks, hot wings, maybe even a favorite jersey. But do you have an M-16, a Kevlar helmet and body armor? Pittsburgh Steelers fan Sheresa Coleman will watch the Super Bowl from the USS Mahan in the Gulf of Aden. Not everybody is watching the game from the comfort of the family den. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops will be deployed in remote war zones, on lonely oceans and at overseas bases -- all far away from an NBC affiliate. So the military is going out of its way to make sure that many soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors can watch Super Bowl XLIII live. \"Super Bowl day has really become a holiday, military-wise, over the last couple years,\" said Petty Officer 1st Class Grant Shannon. Shannon is from a town about an hour north of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but is on board the USS Mahan, a destroyer deployed to stop pirates working off the coast of Somalia. When they finish their duties, sailors like Shannon can head to the ship's mess to watch the Pittsburgh Steelers take on the Arizona Cardinals. The same is true for soldiers, Marines and airmen in combat zones. \"We can broadcast to every forward operating base in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" said Andreas Friedrich, the deputy director of Armed Forces Radio and Television Services, which has been sending the Super Bowl to troops overseas since the first Super Bowl, broadcasting it live since 1981.  Watch how troops will be able to watch big game \u00bb . All told, about 1 million American military personnel and civilians overseas will be able to watch the big game. Some of those watching will be benefiting from the same technology that makes Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle missions possible. A global broadcast system will beam the game to ships and submarines far out in the Pacific Ocean. GBS is how pilots in the United States can watch and fly an unmanned vehicle over a battlefield halfway around the world, and then feed what they see to the battlefield commanders on the ground below. Raytheon, the company that runs the system, will use one of its video channels to feed the game to several U.S. Navy submarines and ships in the Pacific. Tens of thousands of sailors will be able to see the game via GBS, which first broadcast a Super Bowl in 2003, according to Guy DuBois of Raytheon. \"It's a pretty amazing feeling, when you get to do that, to watch it on the ship and knowing that everybody else is back home having a good time, just like we will be,\" said Petty Officer 3rd Class Ryan Wright, a Cardinals fan from Arizona. Wright is on board the USS San Antonio, an amphibious transport dock that is part of the anti-piracy task force. A Steelers fan on board the USS Mahan agrees. \"It would be nice to be home and watch the game in my hometown,\" said Seaman Sheresa Coleman of Pittsburgh. \"But it's a great honor to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" One thing Wright and the other overseas Super Bowl viewers will miss is the legendary Super Bowl commercials. Friedrich said the Armed Forces Radio and Television Services would have had to pay high fees for the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl commercials to an international audience. Instead, the multimillion-dollar ads that some people consider the best part of the game will be pre-empted in favor of Department of Defense-produced ads and public service messages.

Abramovich set a trend with his massive cash injection into Premier League Chelsea. Russian billionaire Abramovich has slipped to third place behind Manchester City's new owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Sheikh Mansour, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family, has a fortune of \u00a315 billion ($22.04B), according to the Football Rich List, researched and published by FourFourTwo magazine. Abramovich has also been overtaken by Indian industrialist Lakshmi Mittal, who is the joint owner of second-flight English side Queens Park Rangers with Formula One's Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore. Abramovich has seen his fortune cut by over \u00a33 billion to \u00a37 billion ($10.29B) in the global economic downturn, the magazine estimated. Have  wealthy owners benefited English football ? His billions gave Chelsea massive spending power to win two successive Premier League titles under Jose Mourinho and accelerated the trend of foreign ownership in English football.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai's five-year term is coming to an end this year. The balloting was originally scheduled for late May, but the independent election commission laid out several reasons for the delay. Security is a factor, the commission said. It also cited a lack of trained staff, incomplete voter registration and the weather. It is difficult to campaign or distribute ballots during the rough winter months in the rugged landscape. The elections are a critical moment for Afghanistan as President Hamid Karzai's five-year term ends. He was elected in December 2004 in largely peaceful polling. But since then, the Taliban militant movement has regrouped, international troop deaths have increased and there has been an increase in terror attacks, mostly in eastern and southern Afghanistan. Afghanistan has already registered 3 million voters and is holding voter drives to register more. The United States will deploy additional troops in coming months to provide much-needed security in the run-up to the election. The country expects to hold parliamentary elections in 2010. Meanwhile on Wednesday coalition forces fighting in southern Afghanistan killed four militants, the U.S. military said. Coalition soldiers were targeting a Taliban leader in the Zabul province when militants fired on them, according to a military statement. Soldiers returned fire, killing the four militants. Soldiers then searched their compound and confiscated several assault rifles. This operation comes as the U.S. military is contemplating adding three brigades to the war effort in Afghanistan. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Tuesday that the troop build up could happen by this summer.

She delivered this commentary during the \"Cutting through the Bull\" segment of Monday night's broadcast. Campbell Brown says President Bush can't seem to see the failure of his administration's response to Hurricane Katrina. (CNN) -- Much of President Bush's news conference today was a defense of the many controversial decisions of his presidency, it was also reflective, with the president showing a willingness to admit and talk about the serious mistakes made by this administration. But on one topic in particular, he seemed almost entirely disconnected from what really happened: Hurricane Katrina. As someone who spent many days in New Orleans, Louisiana, after Hurricane Katrina, I was taken aback listening to the president talk about the government's response. President Bush: . \"People said, 'Well, the federal response was slow.' Don't tell me the federal response was slow when there was 30,000 people pulled off roofs right after the storm passed. I remember going to see those helicopter drivers, Coast Guard drivers, to thank them for their courageous efforts to rescue people off roofs. Thirty-thousand people were pulled off roofs right after the storm moved through. It's a pretty quick response. Could things have been done better? Absolutely. Absolutely. But when I hear people say, the federal response was slow, then what are they going to say to those chopper drivers, or the 30,000 that got pulled off the roofs?\" It is impossible to challenge what so many of us witnessed firsthand -- what the entire country witnessed through television day and night: New Orleans was a city for a time abandoned by the government; where people old and young were left at the New Orleans convention center for days with no water or food. People will disagree over aspects of the Bush legacy, but on the government's handling of Katrina? We were there. Watch Campbell Brown's reaction to President Bush's news conference \u00bb . The whole country saw what happened. People stuck on roofs were one part of a massive catastrophe. But there was so much else the government didn't do. To this day that city is fighting for its life. Mr. President, you cannot pat yourself on the back for that one. We will debate the war in Iraq, national security, the economy and the rest of your legacy. Those debates will continue for years to come. But on how you handled Katrina, there is no debate.

He was 76. John Updike won many literary awards. His books, such as \"The Witches of Eastwick,\" were also best-sellers. Updike passed away Tuesday morning after battling lung cancer. He lived in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts. \"He was one of our greatest writers, and he will be sorely missed,\" said Nicholas Latimer, vice president of publicity at Updike's publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. Updike was a rarity among American writers: a much-esteemed, prize-winning author whose books -- including \"Rabbit, Run\" (1960), \"Couples\" (1968), \"The Witches of Eastwick\" (1984) and \"Terrorist\" (2006) -- were also best-sellers. Updike won the Pulitzer Prize twice: for \"Rabbit Is Rich\" (1981) and its successor, \"Rabbit at Rest\" (1991). iReport: Share your tributes to John Updike . The \"Rabbit\" series, about an angst-ridden car dealer in a town much like Updike's hometown of Shillington, Pennsylvania, spanned four novels, a novella and four decades. In the books -- which also included 1971's \"Rabbit Redux\" and a 2001 novella, \"Rabbit Remembered\" -- onetime basketball star Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom negotiates marriage, divorce, wealth and health problems, never quite understanding the larger forces shaping his life. \"Rabbit is not a character calculated to inspire affection, but he is an unflinchingly authentic specimen of American manhood, and his boorishness makes his rare moments of vulnerability and empathy that much more heartbreaking,\" wrote Time's Lev Grossman in naming \"Rabbit, Run\" to Time's \"All-Time 100 Novels\" list. Updike was incredibly prolific, penning essays, reviews, short stories, poetry and memoirs. His works frequently appeared in The New Yorker, including a famed 1960 essay about Ted Williams' final game, \"Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu.\" \"No writer was more important to the soul of The New Yorker than John,\" said David Remnick, the editor of the magazine, in a statement. \"Even though his literary career transcended any magazine -- he was obviously among the very best writers in the world -- he still loved writing for this weekly magazine, loved being part of an enterprise that he joined when he was so young. \"We adored him,\"  Remnick continued. \"He was, for so long, the spirit of The New Yorker and it is very hard to imagine things without him.\" The magazine said that Updike had written 862 pieces for it over the years, including 327 book reviews, 170 short stories and 154 poems. He was well-regarded in his adopted home state of Massachusetts. \"John Updike's place among America's literary greats is forever secure, as is his special place in every Red Sox fan's heart for his magnificent 'Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu,' \" Sen. John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) said in a statement. \"We honor his memory and his contributions, and Massachusetts today bids him a sad and wistful adieu of our own.\" Updike never won a Nobel Prize, but one of his characters, Henry Bech, received one in \"Bech at Bay\" (1998). His works, particularly given their sexual content, could be as divisive as they were poetic. Many critics accused him of misogyny, and others accused him of using his graceful prose to cover thin subject matter -- and Updike put out his prose by the ream. \"It seems to be easier for John Updike to stifle a yawn than to refrain from writing a book,\" the literary critic James Wood wrote in the London Review of Books in 2001. But his frank discussion of sex also garnered him many readers, the cover of Time magazine (for 1968's \"Couples\") and a lifetime achievement Bad Sex in Writing award from Great Britain's Literary Review. He was criticized by Norman Mailer, hailed by fellow author (and Updike obsessive) Nicholson Baker in \"U and I\" and even appeared as an animated version of himself on a \"Simpsons\" episode as the ghostwriter of a Krusty the Klown book. \"[I] was flattered to be asked to be one of the many voices that they worked into the endless saga of Springfield,\" Updike said, noting that the hardest part of his performance was \"producing a chuckle.\" John Hoyer Updike was born March 18, 1932, in Reading, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Shillington. From an early age he took to reading and writing, and earned a full scholarship to Harvard, where he headed the Harvard Lampoon. Upon graduation, he accepted a one-year fellowship to Oxford University in England. By the time he was 23, he had been offered a position at The New Yorker, which was to become his literary home over the next 50-plus years. Updike's first novel, \"The Poorhouse Fair,\" came out in 1959. The next year, in \"Rabbit, Run,\" he introduced Angstrom, who was to become one of the most famous characters in American fiction. When introduced, Rabbit is a man fleeing his pregnant wife, the songs on the car radio reflecting both the era and his life. Over the course of the \"Rabbit\" books, the character would routinely infuriate his spouse, mistresses and offspring, try to make things right, and never quite succeed. His attitude didn't help. \"Men are all heart and women are all body. I don't know who has the brains. God maybe,\" the character said in \"Rabbit, Run.\" \"Rabbit, Run\" was successful, as were Updike's other '60s books, including \"The Centaur\" (1963), which featured a teacher much like Updike's father, and the short story collection \"The Music School\" (1966). But it was \"Couples\" that made Updike a household name. The book, about a group of spouses engaging in the sexual revolution in suburban Massachusetts, became a No. 1 best-seller. Updike's interests ranged widely. He wrote about an African state in \"The Coup\" (1978). He discussed the relationship between science and religion in \"Roger's Version\" (1986). He revisited \"Hamlet\" in \"Gertrude and Claudius\" (2000). And he created a group of promiscuous witches in \"The Witches of Eastwick\" (1984), which became a hit movie in 1987 starring Jack Nicholson as the devil. Though Updike's work routinely sold well, he was painfully aware of the decline of what's come to be called \"literary fiction.\" In a 2000 interview with Salon, he lamented its difficulties. \"When I was a boy, the best-selling books were often the books that were on your piano teacher's shelf. I mean, Steinbeck, Hemingway, some Faulkner. Faulkner actually had, considering how hard he is to read and how drastic the experiments are, quite a middle-class readership,\" he said. \"But certainly someone like Steinbeck was a best-seller as well as a Nobel Prize-winning author of high intent. You don't feel that now.\" And yet, Updike himself never lost his zest for the written word, and the pleasure brought by jotting, tuning, refining -- creating -- a new story, even as the years drifted by. \"An aging writer has the not insignificant satisfaction of a shelf of books behind him that, as they wait for their ideal readers to discover them, will outlast him for a while,\" he wrote in AARP The Magazine late last year. \"The pleasures, for him, of book-making ... remain, and retain creation's giddy bliss. Among those diminishing neurons there lurks the irrational hope that the last book might be the best.\" Updike's most recent novel, \"The Widows of Eastwick,\" came out in 2008. A collection of stories, \"My Father's Tears and Other Stories,\" is due out later this year.", "aa905ece59d1c439708984809017ac1ae6a03848": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The trial of an Iraqi journalist charged with throwing his shoes at U.S. President George Bush has been postponed, Iraq's Council of Ministers and one of the journalist's lawyers said Tuesday. Amman protesters support Muntazer al-Zaidi, the Iraqi journalist held for throwing his shoes at President Bush. Muntadhir Al-Zaidi was due to go on trial Wednesday, but the Criminal Court postponed it pending an appeal filed by his lawyers with the Federal Court of Appeal, a spokesman for the Supreme Judicial Council, Abdul Sattar Bayrakdar, said. Dhiya al-Saadi, who leads Al-Zaidi's 25-member legal team, confirmed the postponement. Al-Zaidi threw both of his shoes at Bush two weeks ago during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad. Neither shoe hit the president, and others in the room quickly knocked Al-Zaidi to the ground before security officials arrested him. Many Iraqis hail Al-Zaidi, who faces a prison term if convicted, as a hero. More than 1,000 lawyers have volunteered to defend him, al-Saadi said. The lawyers' appeal asked the Federal Court to change Al-Zaidi's case from assaulting Bush to insulting him. If Al-Zaidi is convicted of the former, he faces a maximum of 15 years in prison, al-Saadi said. The lawyers are trying to persuade the appeals court that Al-Zaidi did not want to harm Bush by throwing the shoes, but simply wanted to insult him. By tradition, throwing a shoe is the most insulting act in the Arab world. Al-Saadi said he met with his client several days ago but was having difficulty meeting with him again. He did not give the reason he was not allowed to see Al-Zaidi but said many lawyers have trouble meeting with detainees in Iraqi or U.S. custody. It will take at least two weeks for the court to set a new date for Al-Zaidi's trial, legal expert Tariz Harab said.

Monique Brown is sick of having to look cute all the time. And Scott Hayes is searching for his inner child. Imari Havard, co-founder of PlayDate, dances with some participants on the dance floor. It's Saturday night at PlayDate in Atlanta, Georgia, where 400 adults have gathered to play games, drink and socialize. \"It's not your usual bar scene where I look good, you look good, I'm scared to talk to you,\" Hayes says as he scans a giant Jenga tower for the right block to pull. \"You'll talk to anyone when you're playing games, because you're trying to beat them.\" Next to Hayes, Brown watches a rambunctious game of Pictionary while a twosome fights it out with Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots nearby. Across the room, Lucas joins her friends in a game of Trouble. And on the dance floor, Imari Havard is hula-hooping with some ladies. Havard is the co-founder of Timeless Entertainment Concepts, host of PlayDate, with Ryan Hill and Ronald Gaither. Timeless' mission is clear: provide a fun alternative to the typical nightlife scene for an entrance fee of just $10 per person. In other words, if you're looking for love in all the wrong places, try a game of Hungry Hungry Hippos. Tell us how your and your sweetheart first met . PlayDate began in Atlanta in 2005 and has slowly expanded from a monthly crowd of 80 to 500 twice a month in nine cities across the nation. The three men hope to start affiliates in another 20 markets this year. \"It's a pretty simple word-of-mouth advertising,\" Havard says of how they've made PlayDate so popular. \"The No. 1  question asked on a Monday morning, is 'How was your weekend?' The number two most popular question is 'What did you do?' Well, we've built our entire program around answering those questions.\" While Gaither takes care of the legal and administrative aspects, Hill and Havard attend events and deal with affiliates. The two opposites complement each other. Tonight, Hill wears a red polo shirt and jeans. Havard wears a stingy fedora and a pin-stripe suit jacket. Hill uses the words \"overhead,\" \"clientele\" and \"venue negotiation\" regularly in conversation. Havard is more likely to shout phrases like \"Patricia's in the house, y'all!\" And while Havard is swiveling his hula-hooping hips, Hill blends into the background. \"Someone has to have a respectful corporate face,\" Hill says as he laughs at Havard's antics.  See photos from the event \u00bb . Meanwhile, Alisha Wheeler has on her game face. A man she just met is teaching her to play Scrabble, and it's not as easy as it looks. Wheeler found out about PlayDate on the Internet and decided to check it out. \"To be able to play games again and not be an adult for one night, it's kind of fun,\" she says. \"It's not the typical, uneasy having to go up to someone you don't know, because everyone has on these silly nametags, and [the games] are like an icebreaker.\" Todd Jones agrees. A PlayDate veteran, Jones has been coming to the events since they started three years ago. He's even attended launches in other cities and says the atmosphere is the same everywhere. \"When you go to a club, people will stand around. They're very defensive,\" Jones says. \"But here, you really have to intermingle.\" Gesturing to the six women he's playing Uno with, Jones says he doesn't come to PlayDate looking to hook up. \"I just come here really to have a good time. If something happens after that, then, fine.\" Havard says that's the basis of his company, Timeless, which also offers Paint By Numbers and Call Me UP. Paint By Numbers lets people socialize while painting a 100-square-foot mural. Call Me UP is a new interactive take on a stand-up comedy club. \"You go to a nightclub, a lot of times, that scene is the same,\" Havard says. \"It's too loud; it's too dark; it's too smoky. A lot of people have on their nightclub personas, so you don't get to know real people. What we've found with PlayDate is, it lets people let their guard down and be themselves. It's romantic, in a sense, because you begin to connect like you did when you were younger.\" Back on the dance floor, Havard narrates a game of musical chairs. As the music stops, a woman and man fight for the last chair. \"Girl, you've got a nice booty, but it ain't in the seat,\" Havard shouts into the microphone. \"Everybody say byyyyyeee!\" As the crowd shouts a farewell, Hill looks at his watch, shrugs proudly and smiles. \"It's not every day you can answer 'what do you do for a living?' with 'I have fun, and I make sure other people have fun, too,' \" he says. \"I mean, where else in the world would you see 30- and 40-year-olds playing musical chairs at midnight?\"", "799d802bd5058e527271843e3992b67123319191": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps has acknowledged he engaged in \"regrettable\" behavior and \"demonstrated bad judgment,\" after a British newspaper published a photograph of the swimmer smoking from a bong. Sports attorney Ryan Smith thinks Michael Phelps should speak to public about his opposition to drug use. Ryan Smith, a sports attorney and BET talk show host, on Monday spoke to John Roberts on CNN's \"American Morning\" about how the incident could affect Phelps' career. John Roberts: What was your reaction to news of this picture of Michael Phelps surfacing? Ryan Smith: The thing with Michael Phelps is, he's not only been an outspoken athlete against drugs so he's done a lot of testing, he's been supportive of WADA, which is the World Anti-Doping Agency. But he's really a guy of high character. So you look at this, and my first thought was, \"What about his endorsement deals? What's going to happen in those?\" A lot of endorsement deals have clauses that say that you can't do bad actions like this, not only crimes, but just things that you do bad in public could result in the termination of your contract. So he could lose a lot of money on this. Roberts: Now he never really admitted to smoking marijuana. ... The United States Olympic Committee isn't going to sanction him, it looks like, but did call his actions disappointing. But to the greater issue that you were talking about, in terms of his endorsement deals, do you think anybody is going to say, well, this is the straw that broke the camel's back with this guy? He had one incident back in 2004. But are you going to dump Michael Phelps because of this picture? Smith: It could happen, and the reason why is because a lot of these companies that are sponsoring him really are focused on kids and how actions of their athletes affect children. So that can be a big problem. The other thing is, unlike an athlete that plays sports every year in the public spotlight, the Olympics for swimmers comes only every four years. So he doesn't have that chance to rehabilitate his image immediately like a lot of other athletes, a basketball player or a football player would. So companies might say, you know what, let's not work with Michael Phelps right now, because he doesn't really have a chance to redeem himself. A picture says a thousand words, and how can he fight that? Roberts: How could you turn this around? If you were his attorney, if you were advising him what would you do? Smith: The first thing I would suggest is a drug test. And I know that that's not required. And I also know that he's not really going to have a problem with swimming in 2012. But I would just show that hey, I'm clean, I'm doing great. The next thing I would do is go out there in the public and talk about the troubles with working with drugs and really show the public that you are not about drug use, you are not about doing bad things in public. You are only about supporting the rules of WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, and supporting their drug testing program. So you can show that, hey, this is a minor incident, not a big deal. And really what it's all about is remaining clean. Roberts: If you were to lay a bet, would you say anybody drops him? Smith: I would say he'll have some problems. I don't know if I would say that a big sponsor would drop him, but I would say that a more wholesome-oriented sponsor might.", "68009d839eeb0d71f5ba12a308c15ddf858a1e6e": "(CNN) -- Customs officials in Australia have cried fowl after searching a airline traveler -- and allegedly finding two live pigeons stuffed in his tights.

President Bush withdrew the pardon of Isaac Toussie after a firestorm of criticism. Isaac Toussie, 36, was convicted in 2001 of mail fraud and of making false statements to the Department of Housing and Urban Development that stemmed from the mortgage scheme. The White House initially announced the pardon Tuesday afternoon, immediately setting off a firestorm of criticism from angry homeowners and investors, as well as government watchdog organizations quick to note Toussie's ties to prominent Republican officeholders. Among the questions now being asked are: . \u2022 Why didn't the White House conduct a more thorough investigation of Toussie's background? \u2022 Why did White House Counsel Fred Fielding circumvent the typical pardon application process by directly considering Toussie's clemency request instead of leaving it to the Justice Department? \u2022 Did Toussie get special treatment because of his political connections?  Watch why Bush withdrew the pardon \u00bb . Toussie and his father, also a developer, are defendants in a lawsuit filed in New York federal court on behalf of more than 400 minority home purchasers who allege a conspiracy involving racial steering, racketeering and fraud related to homes the Toussies built on Staten Island, attorney Peter Seidman told CNN. Seidman, a partner in a law firm representing the plaintiffs, said he was \"very pleased\" with President Bush's order for a review of the pardon. \"It [the pardon] was a bitter pill for the home purchasers to swallow,\" he said. The Toussies had previously been accused of conspiring with lenders and others to build and sell substandard homes -- a charge they denied. According to a senior administration official, the White House learned new information about Toussie's case Tuesday night -- hours after the pardon was announced. Specifically, the White House learned, according to the official, \"additional information about the nature of fraud [Toussie] carried out.\" The White House also learned that Toussie's father had made numerous contributions to leading GOP politicians. In 2008, Toussie's father donated almost $40,000 to Arizona Sen. John McCain, Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman, Oregon Sen. Gordon Smith and Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor. White House press secretary Dana Perino issued a statement Wednesday saying that \"based on information that has subsequently come to light,\" Bush had told the Justice Department's pardon attorney not to act on the pardon extended to Toussie. Instead, Perino said, \"The president believes that the pardon attorney should have an opportunity to review this case before a decision on clemency is made.\" While almost all pardon requests go through the Justice Department, the Constitution allows the president to grant a pardon or commutation to any individual for any reason. Perino said Toussie's pardon was withdrawn before it reached the final stage of the process. The president's request never made it to the pardon attorney, who actually executes the pardon requests. Bradford Berenson, Toussie's lawyer, issued a statement saying Toussie \"remains confident\" that the pardon attorney will find in his favor. Toussie was sentenced in September 2003 to a five-month prison sentence in the Long Island case, as well as three years of supervised release. Seidman told CNN that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the Toussies allege that the quality of construction in homes they bought on Staten Island was inferior to that in the model homes upon which they had based their decision to buy. They also allege that their applications were coded by race, a violation of civil rights laws, and that they were steered away from racially integrated neighborhoods to segregated neighborhoods, he said. \"I'm baffled that Toussie was selected as a candidate for a pardon in the first place,\" Seidman said. \"So I don't know what I would say about the re-examination, other than why in the first place they thought he was worthy.\" The Toussies deny the allegations in the lawsuit. An administration official noted it is rare for a pardon to be reversed. Bush's 189 pardons and nine commutations are far fewer than those granted by Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan in either of their two-term administrations. Bush's planned pardon of Toussie was one of 19 presidential pardons announced earlier this week.

It is on that basis that Englaro argued his daughter should be allowed to die, because she had expressed the wish not to be kept alive while in a coma -- indirectly refusing treatment, he said. \"We knew Eluana well, and we always thought of her as a champion of freedom,\" her father said in October. \"She had clear ideas about her life and for her, life was about freedom -- not an obligation to live.\" A series of legal battles finally ended in November, when Italy's highest court, the Court of Cassation, upheld a lower court ruling allowing Englaro to suspend his daughter's treatment. But although Englaro had cleared the last legal hurdle, the court's decision sparked a new fight to find a hospital or clinic that would take out Eluana's feeding tube. Several clinics initially came forward to say they could do it, but the Italian health minister then issued a decree to remind them of their duty of care. Under pressure to adhere to his decree, the clinics backed off. Finally, a private clinic in the northeastern Italian city of Udine agreed to assist in Eluana's case. Monday night, Eluana was transferred from the church-run hospital in Lecco, north of Milan, where she had been kept alive to the Udine clinic. A handful of protesters tried to block the ambulance carrying Eluana from leaving the clinic, one of them holding a banner reading, \"Only thieves and assassins act at night.\" The case has been a controversial one in Italy, a heavily Catholic country where the Vatican has great influence. Last Sunday, Pope Benedict XVI told pilgrims that \"euthanasia is a false solution to suffering.\" Tuesday morning, a top Vatican official was quoted in the Italian media saying, \"Stop the killer hands.\" The Udine clinic says the removal of Eluana's tube will begin in about three days, and the process of allowing her to die will take about 20 days. Clinic officials gave police an outline of the specific steps they are going to take with Eluana during that time. The outline adheres to the Cassation Court's ruling, which required certain steps and conditions once Eluana's feeding tube is removed. Among the steps and conditions was a rule that no video or photography may be taken and that only certain people may enter the patient's room.", "2ca9f740485581f77409191fc97b1f1681e3cf66": "BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- German investigators Thursday acknowledged \"credible information\" indicating that one of the world's most wanted Nazi war criminals died almost 20 years ago in Egypt. The former the hotel in Cairo where Heim spent his final days. The announcement from the Baden-Wuerttemberg State Criminal Investigations Office came a day after German public broadcaster ZDF reported similar findings about Aribert Heim, wanted since 1962. ZDF said research it conducted with the New York Times showed that Heim died in Cairo in 1992 of intestinal cancer. Witness accounts and documents, including a passport, prove that Heim lived under the false name of Tarek Farid Hussein, ZDF said. CNN spoke to Heim's son, Ruediger Heim, who said his father fled Germany to Egypt via France, Spain and Morocco. Ruediger Heim told CNN he visited his father in Cairo several times, including in the final weeks of his life when the terminal cancer was discovered. The German investigators said they were was checking the new information. \"This information has not yet been verified due to time constraints,\" the office said in a statement. But German authorities said they already had hints that Heim was living and working in Egypt. The office said it received information in 1965 and 1967 indicating Heim was working in the country, but Egyptian authorities at the time, acting on a German request, did not find any conclusive evidence. \"Our main goal now is, in cooperation with the Egyptian authorities, (to) identify the remains of Aribert Heim,\" the office said. The chief Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Efraim Zuroff, said the news about Heim's death, if true, is deeply disappointing. \"I personally feel a tremendous sense of disappointment that he escaped justice,\" Zuroff told CNN. But he emphasized that he had not seen the evidence that Heim was dead. \"There is no body and no grave, so we can't do a DNA test,\" he said, adding that \"there are people who have a vested interest in convincing us that he is no longer alive.\" He said he expects to see the documentary evidence of Heim's death on Thursday. Heim would be 94 years old if he were still alive. Zuroff described Heim as \"the most wanted Nazi war criminal,\" and said the Simon Wiesenthal Center was about to raise the reward for information about him from \u20ac315,000 ($405,000) to \u20ac1 million ($1.3 million) when it heard the reports of his death. During World War II Heim was a doctor at the Mauthausen concentration camp, where he was known to inmates as \"Dr. Death\" for performing often-fatal experiments on prisoners. After the war, he was initially cleared of wrongdoing, but in 1962 German authorities issued an arrest warrant for him.

President Obama says the SCHIP bill is a downpayment on his \"commitment to cover every single American.\" The final version of the new law, which expands the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) by roughly $35 billion over the next five years, passed a sharply polarized House of Representatives earlier in the day, with almost every Democrat voting in favor of the expansion and most Republicans opposing it. With the bill, Obama said at a White House ceremony, \"We fulfill one of the highest responsibilities that we have -- to ensure the health and well-being of our nation's children.\" The president said the bill was a downpayment on his \"commitment to cover every single American.\" The SCHIP expansion is Obama's second major legislative win in less than a week. The first was Thursday's approval of the Lilly Ledbetter Pay Equity Act, which makes it easier to sue employers for wage-based discrimination.  Learn more about the SCHIP program \u00bb . The expansion is also a sign of the strength of Washington's new Democratic majority. Former President George W. Bush vetoed two similar health care bills in 2007, arguing that the legislation would encourage families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program. Before the bill's passage, SCHIP covered almost 7 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid -- the federal health insurance program for the poor -- but who can't afford private insurance. The new law boosts total SCHIP funding to approximately $60 billion. The expanded program will be financed with a 62-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes. \"This is a day worthy of celebration. There can be no greater cause ... than protecting the well-being of our nation's children,\" New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the legislation's primary House author, said shortly before the bill's final passage on a 290-135 vote. Passing the health program's expansion is \"morally the right thing to do by our children,\" said freshman Rep. Tom Perriello, D-Virginia. \"At a time when the cost of health care is crushing America's families ... this is an important lifeline.\" Opponents of the legislation argued that, among other things, it will allow undocumented immigrants to illegally access taxpayer-financed health care, and is insufficiently funded. \"This will go out of control just like all the other [entitlement] programs have, and our children will pay,\" Rep. Jack Linder, R-Georgia, warned during the House debate Wednesday. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, ripped the bill as a \"foundation stone for socialized medicine in the United States,\" arguing that raising the income limit for SCHIP eligibility will serve as the basis for a massive expansion of government-run health care. The Senate passed the expansion Friday in a 66-32 vote.

He said there would be no political solution, the online edition of The Island reported.

The snowmen who populated London during the heaviest snowfall in 18 years are looking worse for wear. The pavement might be slippery with ice but the resumption of the bus and rail services means that you'll at least be able to move around the city. All airports in the south are operating normally -- albeit with some delays -- so there's no excuse to stay away. With that in mind, CNN Business Traveller has compiled a guide for visitors to the city. It is still wise to bring an umbrella, but this week you may want to throw in a couple of ski poles. Time zone: London is currently on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), five hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time and eight hours behind Hong Kong. From the airport: Non-stop train services link Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted aiports with central London. The Heathrow Express takes 15 minutes to Paddington Station and costs from $24 (\u00a316.50) for a single journey. The London Underground costs only $6 (\u00a34) but takes an hour. A breakfast meeting: Visitors with a healthy budget and appetite might want to start the day at the Grand Caf\u00e9 in The Wolseley (160 Piccadilly, W1J) where you where you can buy a traditional fry-up or \"The English\" for just shy of $20 (\u00a313.50). A budget option with no less of a London flavor can be found at the The Cock Tavern (East Poultry Avenue, EC1A) in the heart of Smithfield Market. Meat has been traded there for 800 years and early in the morning you can still see butchers plying their trade in bloodied coats. For dinner: Impress with a table at one of London's most famous restaurants, Le Gavroche (43 Upper Brook Street, W1K) or Gordon Ramsay at Claridge's (Brook Street, W1K) . For a cheaper option try a traditional pie and mash shop, the once staple of working class East London life. One of the oldest is M Manze (87 Tower Bridge Road, SE1) that sells jellied eels as well as pie and mash amid the traditional decor of tiled walls, wooden benches and white marble table-tops. For a drink: Two of the oldest London pubs include Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese (145 Fleet Street, EC4A) in the City of London and The Prospect of Whitby (57 Wapping Wall, E1W) a short walk along the Thames from Canary Wharf. For one of the best hotel bars try the Lanesborough (Hyde Park Corner, SW1X) and One Aldwych (1 Aldwych, WC2B). High-flyers can also take in the view over a drink at Vertigo 42, the champagne bar atop Tower 42 (25 Old Broad Street, EC2N). Tipping: Expect to tip around 10 percent in restaurants and cabs, but no tips are expected in bars. On a fine afternoon (they do exist):  Visit St James's Park to seek out its pelicans and to catch a view of Buckingham Palace from the bridge on the lake. Then walk via Westminster Abbey to Waterloo Bridge for spectacular views of The Palace of Westminster, Somerset House and Victoria Embankment. Finish with a ride on the London Eye. Staying dry: Improve your swing at one of London's indoor golf centers. Urban Golf (Soho and Smithfield) features eight simulators, two putting greens, a bar and lounge and coaching. Shelter can also be found in some of London's iconic department stores. Harrods and Harvey Nichols are both in Knightsbridge. Opening hours: Most shops and businesses are open from 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. Larger stores in central London stay open till 7 p.m or 8 p.m. and later on Thursdays. What to avoid: The crowds of tourists in Leicester Square, the Trocadero and the ubiquitous Scottish Steakhouses in London's West End. Transport: Be warned: a single-stop tube journey in central London costs $8 (\u00a34). To save money buy an Oyster card, which can be used on London's underground (\u00a31.60 per single-stop journey), buses, trams and some overland rail services. Black cabs can be hailed anywhere. Fares are high but the pay-off is that all drivers must pass the \"Knowledge\" -- an in-depth exam on navigating around London -- which means they really do know where they are going. Don't miss in February: In 2009 the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (Richmond, TW9) is celebrating its 250th anniversary with a \"Tropical Extravaganza\" of exotic plants in one of its conservatories. The Natural History Museum (Cromwell Road, SW7) is commemorating the bicentenary of Charles Darwin's birth and 150th year of the publication of On the Origin of Species with a major exhibition. A number of star-studded plays have also just opened in London's theatreland. Imelda Staunton, star of Harry Potter, is in Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane (Trafalgar Studios until April 11). James McAvoy is in Richard Greenberg's Three Days of Rain (Apollo Theatre until May 2). What to pack: February is a particularly bleak and cold month in Britain so pack an umbrella and warm clothes. For a handy keepsake of the city, buy an umbrella on arrival from James Smith & Sons (53 New Oxford Street, WC1A). The shop has hardly changed since it opened in 1830 and offers an impressive range of umbrellas and essential gentlemen's accessories. Oh, and don't forget to pack thermals and some decent footwear.

Steps to shore up FannieMae and Freddie Mac could eventually stabilize home prices. Friday's closure of California-based IndyMac bank by federal regulators on Friday sparked investor panic that sent shares of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a wild ride and fueled speculation of a government rescue. On Sunday, the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve announced steps to make funds available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if necessary. IndyMac, which reopened Monday under federal supervision, was once one of the nation's largest home lenders. Thanks in part to the nation's mortgage crisis, it lost hundreds of millions of dollars this year and last, and concerns about the bank led customers to withdraw $1.3 billion in the last two weeks, prompting the government takeover. Below, CNN's Ali Velshi and Gerri Willis answer questions about Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and IndyMac and how you may be affected. Q: What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and what do they do? A: Originally chartered by Congress, both were converted into private companies with shares traded on Wall Street.  Neither company directly loans money to prospective home buyers. Instead, they buy mortgages from banks and other lenders on the secondary market, thus freeing up more funds to home lenders. They resell bundled loans as mortgage-backed securities.   Read more about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u00bb . Combined, the two companies own or guarantee almost half of the home loans in the United States, or $5.3 trillion of mortgage debt. Q: How did they get their names? A: Fannie Mae was created in 1938, during the Great Depression. The nickname comes from the acronym FNMA, which stands for Federal National Mortgage Association. Freddie Mac was chartered by Congress as a private corporation in 1970 to end Fannie Mae's monopoly over the secondary mortgage market. The name Freddie Mac spawns from the acronym FHLMC, or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Q: What's the connection between the IndyMac takeover and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? A: Nothing, except both crises stem from the same problem: a drop in home prices and the inability of mortgage-holders to make their payments, thereby leaving banks (whether it was IndyMac, an actual lender, or Fannie/Freddie, the secondary banks that had bought mortgages) holding the bag. Q: Will the government's actions change the value of my home? A: Steps the federal government is taking to shore up Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae is ultimately a positive for the housing industry. Although it won't happen overnight, housing prices could be stabilized by the move. The reason? These two institutions are critical to the smooth functioning of the mortgage underwriting industry. Q: Is my money safe in the bank? A: Up to certain limits, money is safe in banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The FDIC guarantees traditional bank accounts up to $100,000 and individual retirement accounts up to $250,000. Money beyond those limits isn't guaranteed if a bank fails. In the case of IndyMac, the FDIC says it will cover 50 percent of uninsured balances there. But as a practical matter, consumers shouldn't count on that. Bottom line: Owning accounts with amounts that exceed the FDIC limits is like driving without a seat belt.  Watch: Is your bank safe? \u00bb . Q: How are the government's moves to help Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac going to affect mortgages, loans and the federal budget deficit? A: Shoring up Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae is good news for consumer lending lending generally because it boosts confidence in the mortgage markets. If you already have a loan, it's won't have immediate consequences. We don't yet know if it will be successful and how much the two entities might take advantage of the federal governments offer to lend them money. For that reason, it's difficult to say what the impact might be on the federal budget deficit.

Their tales of transformations and redemption inspire him to keep talking about educational empowerment and overcoming adversity, he said. An obstacle is a hurdle, and \"you jump over it,\" Carson said.  \"Every time you see a hurdle, you jump over it, and it strengthens you for the next one. And if that's the case, you lead a victorious life, because whatever comes before you, you know you're going to get around it.\" Carson was raised in Detroit, majored in psychology at Yale University and attended medical school at the University of Michigan, where he studied neurosurgery. Carson's life has been told through plays, books and movies, including a TNT made-for-TV movie called \"Gifted Hands,\" which airs Saturday. (TNT is part of Turner Broadcasting, which also owns CNN.) The biopic stars Academy Award winner Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carson. \"I think he's an angel, a gift from God,\"  Gooding said. \"He has touched a lot of people's lives.\" Carson holds more than 50 honorary doctorates and hundreds of other awards. He's fortunate, he acknowledges, but this doctor does not believe in luck. \"I always say you make your own luck by being prepared,\" he said. His mom pushed him hard. Sonya Carson \"would not accept the victim mentality. She wouldn't let us accept the victim mentality. No excuses. She didn't make excuses, and she didn't accept excuses,\" Carson said. She turned off the TV, sent Carson and his brother to the library and made them write weekly book reports. Meanwhile, she worked several jobs to support her two sons. She is now 80 and lives with Carson in Baltimore, Maryland. When Carson was young, he was influenced by stories about Booker T. Washington, a former slave who taught himself to read and later advised presidents, and the biblical character Joseph, who persevered though his brothers sold him into slavery. \"Those kinds of stories had an impact on me and helped me to believe it's not where you started, it's where you end that counts. And you have a whole lot to do with that,\" he said. \"Everybody has problems. They just come in different forms. If that problem for you becomes a containing fence, then you become a victim. Once you think you're a victim, you are one, and you're not going anywhere.\" In the same way, Carson's biography has resonated with people like 22-year-old Douglas Nivens II of Baltimore, Maryland. Nivens' mother was killed when he was 4 years old, and his father was imprisoned for her murder. His aunt raised him, and he endured relentless teasing for his interest in academics while attending public schools in Baltimore City. During middle school, Nivens picked up Carson's autobiography, \"Gifted Hands,\" and immediately identified with it. \"It was a relief to see someone grew up in the city and didn't have a luxurious life but overcame it all,\" he said. \"I love stories about underdogs, those who overcome adversity and do something.\" When he was in middle school, Nivens won two $1,000 scholarships from the Carson Scholars Fund, which helps children with strong academics pay for college. \"When it came to times of doubt during high school, when I talked to my adviser, they would say, 'You got this award. Not everyone gets it. You're not dumb. You have the tools to be successful in life,' \" Nivens said. \"That's what really helped me in terms of self-esteem and management in high school.\" He graduated with honors from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in May. \"I probably should not be where I am,\" said Nivens, a budget analyst for the U.S. Social Security Administration. \"I went to Baltimore public schools. My father's in jail; my mother is dead. Statistically, I should not be here. I should be on parole somewhere or even dead. I never looked at it that way. I made it through.\" Carson said he's heartened by stories pf people who've been inspired by his biography. \"My message is that the person who has the most to do with what happens to you is you,\" Carson said. \"Not somebody else, and not the environment. If you have a normal brain, you're capable of incredible things.\"", "8c55b69bd82f39eadba5a08429f6ffe79933823f": "(CNN) -- Actress Ashley Judd says a wolf management program backed by Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is \"incredibly savage ... it's not right, it's not appropriate, it makes no sense on any level.\" Ashley Judd is criticizing the aerial hunting of wolves, a program supported by Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Appearing on CNN's \"Larry King Live,\" Judd repeated her criticism of a program that allows hunters firing from aircraft to shoot wolves to thin the numbers of the animals. Judd recently appeared in a video for the Washington-based Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund, which also opposes the Palin-backed aerial hunting program. Referring to the former Republican vice presidential candidate by name in the video, Judd says that Palin is \"championing the slaughter of wildlife.\" \"When Sarah Palin came on the national scene last summer, few knew that she promotes the brutal aerial killing of wolves,\" Judd says in the video, adding, \"It is time to stop Sarah Palin and stop this senseless savagery.\" Palin responded on Tuesday, releasing a statement calling Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund an \"extreme fringe group,\" and saying, \"It is reprehensible and hypocritical that the Defenders of Wildlife would use Alaska and my administration as a fundraising tool to deceive Americans into parting with their hard-earned money.\"  Watch why Judd, Palin are trading barbs \u00bb . Judd said Alaska's program is a \"distortion\" of wildlife hunting under normal circumstances, and that the program attracts \"urban hunters, trophy hunters from out of state.\" Palin did not appear on \"Larry King Live,\" but Rod Arno, executive director of the Alaska Outdoor Council, told King by telephone that only Alaska residents can participate in the aerial wolf-hunting program, and then they must obtain a state permit. The purpose of the program is to facilitate control of Alaska's wolf population, which preys on moose and caribou, Arno said. \"The only criticism is from people who aren't up here participating in a predator-prey scheme,\" he said. Judd was accompanied by Rodger Schlickeisen, CEO of the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund, and he said \"hundreds\" of scientists have criticized the aerial hunting program. Schlickeisen suggested that Palin's government allow television crews to videotape the hunting process \"and you could put this out for all the people in American to see and she (Palin) could proudly stand up for it.\"", "8bc2356d06dd7900fc4f04bf2fae6001394421c8": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- A recently retired Mexican army general whose bullet-riddled body was found Tuesday near Cancun had taken over as the area's top antidrug official less than 24 hours earlier, officials said. A soldier guards the forensics office where the body of a slain former general was taken in Cancun, Mexico. Retired Gen. Mauro Enrique Tello Qui\u00f1onez, his aide and a driver were tortured before being killed, said Quintana Roo state prosecutor Bello Melchor Rodriguez y Carrillo. He said there was no doubt Tello and the others were victims of organized crime. \"The general was the most mistreated,\" Rodriguez said at a Tuesday night news conference monitored by El Universal newspaper. \"He had burns on his skin and bones in his hands and wrists were broken.\" An autopsy revealed Tello also suffered broken knees and was shot 11 times, Mexico City's Excelsior newspaper said. Tello had just been appointed a special drug-fighting consultant for Gregorio Sanchez Martinez, the mayor of the Benito Juarez municipality, which includes the city of Cancun. Tello, who retired from the army in January at the mandatory age of 63, had moved to the resort area three weeks ago. The three victims were found inside a white Toyota  pickup truck outside of Cancun on the road to Merida. The truck belongs to the Benito Juarez municipality, Excelsior said, citing Luis Raymundo Canche, an assistant prosecutor for Quintana Roo state. The three men were abducted Monday night, possibly in Cancun, tortured and then later shot to death, El Universal said, citing prosecutor Rodriguez. The bodies were found with their hands bound, the newspaper said. The killings happened around 4 a.m., the prosecutor said. The other two victims were identified as Lt. Julio Cesar Roman Zuniga, who was Tello's aide and the chief bodyguard for Mayor Mart\u00ednez, and civilian driver Juan Ramirez Sanchez. Tello is the second high-ranking army officer to be killed in the area in the past few years. Lt. Col. Wilfrido Flores Saucedo and his aide were gunned down on a Cancun street in 2006. That crime remains unsolved. The killings come as Mexico grapples with the highest violent-death rates in its history -- around 5,400 slayings in 2008, more than double the 2,477 reported in 2007, according to Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora. Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich has characterized the battle among drug cartels and with government authorities as a \"civil war.\" On Tuesday, 12 men were gunned down in Chihuahua state in northern Mexico, Excelsior reported Wednesday. Eight other people were shot and killed in Chihuahua last weekend. More than 200 people have been killed this year in Ciudad Juarez, the largest city in Chihuahua and considered the most violent town in Mexico, El Tiempo newspaper said, citing local authorities. Last year, according to the National Commission on Human Rights, there were 1,900 organized crime killings in the state of Chihuahua. About 1,600 of those slayings occurred in Ciudad Juarez.", "ea52e75c7fa8f5912902dea6c8a38092e3ce3944": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pledging to take \"the air out of golden parachutes,\" President Obama announced Wednesday that executives of companies receiving federal bailout money will have their pay capped at $500,000 under a revised financial compensation plan. $500,000 will be the limit on executive salaries at companies receiving tax dollars, President Obama says. Last year's \"shameful\" handout of $18 billion in Wall Street bonuses \"is exactly the kind of disregard for the costs and consequences of their actions that brought about this crisis: a culture of narrow self-interest and short-term gain at the expense of everything else,\" Obama said to reporters at the White House. \"For top executives to award themselves these kinds of compensation packages in the midst of this economic crisis isn't just bad taste -- it's a bad strategy -- and I will not tolerate it. We're going to be demanding some restraint in exchange for federal aid -- so that when firms seek new federal dollars, we won't find them up to the same old tricks,\" the president added. Under Obama's plan, companies that want to pay their executives more than $500,000 will have to do so through stocks that cannot be sold until the companies pay back the money they borrow from the government. The rules will be implemented by the Treasury Department and do not need to be approved by Congress. The restrictions will most affect large companies that receive \"exceptional assistance,\" such as Citigroup. The struggling banking giant has taken about $45 billion from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program. The new rules also will mandate that shareholders of banks have a greater say about the salaries paid to company heads. The measures will put in place greater transparency for costs such as holiday parties and office renovations. Obama also pledged further reforms in the future, promising that the administration will \"examine the ways in which the means and manner of executive compensation have contributed to a reckless culture and quarter-by-quarter mentality that in turn have wrought havoc in our financial system.\"  Watch Obama talk about limiting executive salaries \u00bb . \"We're going to be taking a look at broader reforms so that executives are compensated for sound risk management and rewarded for growth measured over years, not just days or weeks,\" Obama said.

A man brandishes a knife while others carry old notes during a demonstration against record-high inflation. More than 15,000 refugees have arrived in the Yemeni port city of Aden since January, compared with 7,166 people in the first four months of 2007, according to a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Many of those seeking asylum brave treacherous boat trips across the Gulf of Aden. Consequently, the number of boats landing in Aden has jumped from 60 to 361 since January while the number of fatalities has remained constant, according to UNHCR. The agency attributed the surge to strife in Somalia, where riots continued in the capital city of Mogadishu for the second day Tuesday. According to news reports, Somali soldiers killed at least two people Monday during the protests over rising food prices.  Watch protesters take to the streets \u00bb . Somali refugees pay as much as $150 to cross the Gulf of Aden in search of asylum. Because of its proximity to the war-torn country, Yemen is a common destination for Somalis fleeing economic hardship, famine and war. Yemen is also an attractive location because Somalis receive automatic refugee status in the fellow Muslim country. New smuggling routes across the Red Sea have also led to increased numbers of refugees in Yemen, according to the UNHCR. Refugees often die before reaching Yemen because of dangerous sea conditions and overcrowded vessels. Others die at the hands of their smugglers, who order the passengers to jump overboard when the Yemeni coast guard approaches the vessel. Yemen's coast guard stepped up patrols of its coastline this year in an attempt to deter smugglers, according to the UNHCR, which operates shelters and reception centers for refugees in Yemen. The coast guard has also seized boats and given them Somali fishermen affected by the 2004 tsunami.", "7a8cf8e961ba14050c96df4aa2090efcb7ae761a": "(CNN)  -- Launch of the space shuttle Discovery has been delayed at least a week, NASA has announced.

People were stuck when an 8-mile-long chunk of Lake Erie ice broke away near Toledo, Ohio. The incident, in which one person was pronounced dead after being transported to the hospital, came after the National Weather Service issued a warning that ice floes could break away from the main ice area in the western section of the lake. At least some of those rescued were fishermen. \"This just cost the taxpayers a ton of money,\" Ottawa County, Ohio, Sheriff Bob Bratton said. \"We lost a life out there today. ... I'm sorry a man lost his life out there today. These people should have known better.\" Bratton said those rescued should never have been on Lake Erie in the first place because weather conditions made it risky, and \"if there was a section in the code about common sense, we would have had 150 arrests out there today.\"  Watch sheriff express frustration \u00bb . A spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard said the person who died fell in the water when the ice floe broke away from land.

These people endangered the life of volunteer firemen, [and] the United States Coast Guard,\" Bratton said, estimating the cost of the sheriff's office response at $25,000. \"I'm sure that's going to climb.\" Bratton told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that the fishermen displayed poor judgment in building a makeshift bridge to get from one section of the ice to the other. \"I have no problem with people ice fishing, but these idiots should realize that when you see open water, you should not build a bridge and cross it,\" he said. \"It's a shame you can't arrest people for stupidity.\" Among the hundreds of people who went fishing Saturday were Gary and David Vaughn of Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania. They told the Plain Dealer that they set up a shanty about 7 a.m. and didn't come back out until 11 a.m., when they saw a crowd gathered at the edge of the ice. It was then that they knew they were in trouble. \"When we were over there waiting to be rescued, we feared the ice would just break up under us,\" Gary Vaughn, 47, told the newspaper. \"I feared for my life.\" The sheriff told the Toledo Blade that the people who went out on the ice did not take proper precautions. \"Where is the common sense when they know the ice is broken?\" Bratton said. \"The experienced fishermen, I guarantee, are not out there,\" he told the newspaper. \"They're not reading the weather. If the ice is broke, you don't build a little bridge to get from here to there.\" \"Ice fishing and recreation on the ice is a culture in the Great Lakes. It's something we've become used to,\" Lanier said. iReport.com: Were you there? Share your photos, story . The sheriff said there were a host of factors that the fishermen should have been aware of, which caused them to risk their lives unnecessarily. \"The weather changed; the temperature went up; the wind was coming out of the south. These are all things that are indicators [that an ice floe break could occur].\" Asked whether there are signs or other notification systems to discourage fishermen from going out on the ice under risky conditions, Bratton said there are only Web sites fishermen can check. \"We will go back and look at that,\" he said. \"We can't develop the attitude, 'Go out on the ice. If you get caught, we'll be there to get you. We'll bring you in.' You've got to have common sense.\"  Watch lake officials describe rescue efforts \u00bb .

Jennifer Hudson is in a new movie, \"The Secret Life of Bees,\" and recently released her first solo album. At a time when the singer is in a new movie, \"The Secret Life of Bees,\" and recently released her first solo album, Hudson is now back in the public eye largely due to a family tragedy. Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, and brother, Jason Hudson, were found shot to death Friday in their Chicago home. The body of the singer's missing 7-year-old nephew, Julian King, was found in an SUV on Monday morning. Julian's stepfather, William Balfour, was detained over the weekend for questioning in connection with the case, a police spokesperson told CNN. He was subsequently transferred to prison on a parole violation charge, the spokesperson said. Balfour's mother has acknowledged that her son has been questioned about the shootings, but said he had nothing to do with the crime. No charges had been filed against anyone in connection with the murders. iReport.com: Reaction to Hudson family tragedy . The tragedy is a sad turn for the 27-year-old actress and singer, who first earned national notice for her performances on \"American Idol\" in 2004 and won an Oscar for best supporting actress for 2006's \"Dreamgirls.\" Hudson's singing career began in her church choir in the South Side Chicago neighborhood of Englewood when she was a child. She remained devoted to singing all the way through Chicago's Dunbar Vocational High School, where there is now a Jennifer Hudson Room. (She's in good company; Dunbar's alumni include Lou Rawls and two of the Staple Singers.) \"People would say it was unusual for such a small girl to have such a big voice,\" she told Reuters in 2006. \"They would say, 'She sounds like she's grown.' \" After finishing school, she performed in the musical \"Big River\" at a Chicago-area dinner theater and took a job on a cruise line. In 2003, she auditioned for \"American Idol\" in Atlanta, Georgia, and managed to earn her way to the top-rated show with a performance of \"Easy to be Hard,\" the \"Hair\" ballad popularized by Three Dog Night. \"Idol\" proved to be an uneven experience for Hudson. After the show narrowed down its 12 finalists, she started slowly, at times almost being voted off, but eventually her song choices -- including Elton John's \"Circle of Life\" and Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" -- made her one of the favorites. Sir Elton himself believed she was the \"best of the lot.\" 'Idol' friend speaks out about Hudson case . In the end, Hudson didn't even come close to making \"Idol's\" final two, being voted off midway in the show's run. However, her performances had established her as a talent to watch, and in May 2005 -- several months after finishing the traditional post-\"Idol\" group tour -- she was contacted by a casting agency about the part of Effie, the tragic soul of \"Dreamgirls.\" In the musical, which concerns an all-girl trio much like the Supremes, Effie is a weight-challenged musical powerhouse who begins as the group's leader but is dropped as both performer and lover by the group's manager for the more statuesque singer Deena. The role features the musical's showstopping song, \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,\" and won Jennifer Holliday a Tony Award when \"Dreamgirls\" ran on Broadway. Hudson was unfamiliar with \"Dreamgirls\" when she auditioned, but she allegedly beat out almost 800 other women for the role -- including her former \"Idol\" rival, Fantasia Barrino, who had been the third-season winner. The role's high-pitched emotions were a challenge, Hudson told the Chicago Sun-Times in 2006. \"I had to find a way into it,\" she said to the newspaper. \"[Director] Bill Condon sent me into 'Diva 101.' He told me I was too nice. So I'd come into the room angry, but tell all the ADs, 'Bill told me to do this. This is Effie and not Jennifer.' I had to learn how to separate myself from the character with that attitude. That was Bill's main concern. Effie had to have that edge.\" Her performance won her across-the-board raves. Variety compared her turn to Barbra Streisand's award-winning debut in \"Funny Girl,\" among others. It also led to a host of awards, including supporting actress honors from the New York Critics Circle, Golden Globes, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and -- finally -- the Academy Awards. At the Oscar show, Hudson tearfully thanked her grandmother, whom she described as her \"biggest inspiration.\" Julia Kate Hudson, who sang at Pleasant Gift Missionary Baptist Church, where Hudson got her start, died in 1998. Since winning the Oscar, Hudson has been a mainstay of celebrity magazines, which have broadcast news of her engagement to \"I Love New York 2\" contestant David Otunga, regularly singled her out as an example of a healthy plus-sized body type and held her up as an \"Idol\" made good. She's continued her movie career with performances in \"Sex and the City: The Movie\" and \"The Secret Life of Bees,\" both of which came out in 2008. She sang the national anthem at the Democratic National Convention in August at the personal request of Sen. Barack Obama's campaign. According to many reports, Hudson has remained humble amid all the attention. She remains devoted to the church -- \"Church is where I'm from. It will always be my favorite place to sing, and that's where I'd like to go back to,\" Hudson told the Sun-Times -- and uses her against-all-odds biography to inspire others. \"I've had a similar journey as Effie,\" Hudson told the Sun-Times. \"Me being a part of 'Idol,' her being part of the group. ... We both go through our journeys, trying to hold on to our dream and achieve our goal. We have hardships, but we prevail at the end.\"", "74cde23c933ad6243bb276efc925d4c9afbabc1a": "(CNN) -- French Prime Minister Francois Fillon unveiled further details Monday of a 26 billion-euro ($33 billion) business stimulus package which his government hopes can stall falling growth and prevent the country joining other major European economies in recession. Up to 1,000 projects will benefit from the package, which was first proposed by President Nicolas Sarkozy in December and approved by French lawmakers last week. Around 20 billion euros of the total amount will be spent over the next 12 months. Businesses will receive 11.4 billion euros while the same amount will be invested in public projects with social housing identified as a priority.

Somalia's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital, with the help of Ethiopian forces. On Friday, fighters from the Islamic group Al Shabab took control of the southern port town of Kismayo after three days of clashes. The fighting left at least 89 people dead, 207 wounded and displaced some 5,500 people, triggering a humanitarian crisis. Ethiopia invaded Somalia in December 2006 to install the transitional government in Mogadishu after a decade and a half of near-anarchy. The invasion had the blessing of the United States, which accused Islamists of harboring fugitives from the al Qaeda terrorist movement. But the Ethiopian troops quickly became embroiled in an insurgency led by the Islamists. And as guerrilla attacks mounted, efforts to replace the Ethiopians with an African Union-led peacekeeping mission faltered. The conflict displaced hundreds of thousands of Somalis, further worsening a humanitarian crisis that dates back to the collapse of the country's last government in 1991.

Richard Shelby says. \"Everybody on the street in America understands that,\" said Sen. Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. \"This is not the right road to go. We'll pay dearly.\" Shelby, of Alabama, told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that the package and efforts to shore up the struggling banking system will put the United States on \"a road to financial disaster.\" But Lawrence Summers, the head of the administration's National Economic Council, said Republicans have lost their credibility on the issue.  Watch Republicans criticize the stimulus bill \u00bb . \"Those who presided over the last eight years -- the eight years that brought us to the point where we inherit trillions of dollars of deficit, an economy that's collapsing more rapidly than at any time in the last 50 years -- don't seem to me in a strong position to lecture about the lessons of history,\" Summers told ABC's \"This Week.\" President Barack Obama, his advisers and the Democratic leaders of Congress argue the roughly $830 billion measure will help pull the U.S. economy out of its current skid. Much of the package involves infrastructure spending, long-term energy projects and aid to cash-strapped state and local governments. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported last week that the measure is likely to create between 1.3 million and 3.9 million jobs by the end of 2010, lowering a projected unemployment rate of 8.7 percent by up to 2.1 percentage points. But the CBO warned the long-term effect of that much government spending over the next decade could \"crowd out\" private investment, lowering long-term economic growth forecasts by 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent by 2019. In a concession to Republicans, about a third of the bill involves tax cuts. But the measure is expected to have only minimal GOP support when it goes to a scheduled vote early this week.  Watch South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford warn of \"disastrous consequences \u00bb .

Senators reached a tentative agreement Friday on a compromise bill largely negotiated by a handful of moderate Republicans whose votes are needed to prevent a filibuster. But McCain told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that the package should have been about half the size of the one now before senators, and should be balanced between tax cuts and spending. \"We're going to amass the largest debt in the history of this country, by any measurement, and we're going to ask our kids and grandkids to pay for it,\" he said. The stimulus bill includes about $45 billion in transportation spending, much of which can be spent on projects \"that can be implemented immediately,\" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood told CNN. LaHood, a former Republican congressman from Illinois, said he would talk to his former colleagues on Capitol Hill \"and do all that I can to persuade them that this bill really will put people to work.\" He said he invited state transportation chiefs to Washington for a Wednesday meeting on how to create jobs using funding from the stimulus bill. \"There aren't going to be any boondoggles. This money will be spent correctly, by the book, with no shortcuts,\" LaHood said. The administration is also readying a second phase of the financial bailout program launched by the Bush administration last fall. Shelby said Obama and his advisers need to address the staggering problems in the U.S. banking system first. \"Until we straighten out our banking system, until there is trust in our banking system, until there's investment there, this economy is going to continue to tank,\" he said. Shelby also has been critical of other efforts by the federal government to help the struggling economy, including legislation that would have provided a bailout to the auto industry. But Sen. Kent Conrad, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, told CBS the current recession -- which has already produced an unemployment rate of 7.6 percent -- is in danger of a deep downturn \"like we saw in the Great Depression.\" \"If there is a failure to give a significant boost to this economy, this crisis will only deepen and become far more serious,\" said Conrad, D-North Dakota.", "0df814d8bb76641e21693a7935845ea628132449": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The humble mobile phone is driving a new revolution which some experts hope could bring fairer elections and democracy to some African states. During the 2006 local government elections in Senegal, Radio Sud used reporters and correspondents with cell phones to call in what they saw. Many African countries have struggled against rigged elections and authoritarian rule since gaining independence last century. However, African observers say the growth of simple communication technologies like cell phones are assisting many states to progress towards open and fair elections in increasingly democratic systems. Senegal is one of a number of African countries to hold successful elections by keeping voting and counting in check through independent communication. Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said many African nations now had a \"very open society\" and the increasing success of elections owed a lot to the existence of mobile phones. \"With communication and cell phones, this is where it is difficult to cheat in elections now. You are announced at the district level and cell phones go wild so by the time you go to the capital, if you have changed the figures, they will know and you will be caught out.\" According to experts, cellphones are particularly important for Africa due to a lack of some other technologies. Visiting African political expert at Indiana University, Sheldon Gellar, said cellphones were much more accessible than the internet in most parts of Africa, and therefore had greater potential to influence transparency. \"Internet provides groups in society with means to communicate, organize and obtain good information which is not controlled by government -- but, only a tiny percentage of African populations have access to internet.\" Just this month CNN reported dramatic increases in cell phone usage in African nations. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, there are just 10,000 fixed telephones but cellphone subscribers have soared to more than a million in the last five years. Gellar told CNN the key benefit of cell phones was that they allowed independent media, especially radio, to provide accurate coverage of elections and make it more difficult for ruling parties to cheat and get away with it. \"During the 2006 local government elections in Senegal, Radio Sud used reporters and correspondents with cell phones to call in what they saw. I remember hearing one reporter describing how a local party boss was illegally taking a ballot box on his truck from the polling station. This was reported live as it was happening.\" Civilians and independent election observers outside the media have also taken advantage of cell phones to monitor elections. Bob LaGamma, executive director of Council for a Community of Democracies, said the 2007 Nigerian election was another example of technology being used effectively. LaGamma described a technique of \"parallel reporting\", whereby independent observers spread news of local vote counts and any irregularities. This technique was also used in the Zimbabwe elections this year, which he said caused Robert Mugabe to delay announcement of election results. \"Parallel reporting was important in Zimbabwe. It kept them from coming straight out and reporting a false result. \"All of this technology is very important and gives a powerful new tool that cuts the ability for cheating,\" LaGamma said. Gellar said other computing technology, though more sparse, could also have a positive impact towards building democracies. He told CNN computers could be used to ensure parliament has access to national budget information and spending patterns, and in urban and rural communities they could provide citizens with data concerning the functions of the government and offer people an opportunity to contact their elected representative. Despite the positive developments brought by cell phones and other communication technology, there have still been problems with numerous elections in recent years. Leonardo Arriola, Associate Professor at University of California, Berkeley, is wary about the potential of the technologies to make some situations worse. He said there could be both good and bad aspects to it. \"The more transparency and the more information that can be circulated outside the hands of government is a good thing ... but the other side of that is that a lot of misinformation can get out that way also,\" Arriola said. Although there has undoubtedly been positive progress with cell phone technology, most scholars and observers agree that pockets full of mobile handsets will not be enough to build stable democratic states and hold future fair elections. \"It doesn't mean anything unless you have all of the means of verifying the results. If you have a ruling authoritarian regime which is determined to cheat, they will do it,\" LaGamma said. Gellar sees the technology as necessary, but not sufficient for progress. \"Africans have been able to organize without technology. Freedom of association -- the right to organize autonomous organizations and function freely -- is more important than access to new technology in fostering democracy. \"That said, new technology can be a powerful tool in improving communications between citizens and governments, between civil society organizations and the public. Informed citizens are essential to good functioning of democracies,\" he said. Gellar said a number of other factors needed to progress before a state could move towards a more democratic model of governance. According to Gellar these changes include: strengthening independent media; growing and ensuring freedom of civil society; decentralizing power, ceding more control to local governments; empowering women; improving judicial systems to ensure independence and power to punish. Gellar said new technology could help achieve those goals to some extent, as communication was the key to overcoming oppression. \"Authoritarian regimes want to control and monopolize the flow of information. African authoritarian regimes don't have the power and resources to completely control information disseminated through traditional means -- as oral communications are still the main means of disseminating information,\" Geller explained. Gellar said the changes being brought about by cell phones and other communication technologies could well play a part in bringing more participatory governments to the continent. \"New technology is not a panacea, but it can speed up processes of democratization and should be encouraged,\" he concluded.", "125fa4fa5d93c3237909f033d9466172fdc674fc": "(CNN) -- Key structural changes have been identified in the brain images of some patients with mild cognitive impairment which could help determine who's at greatest risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, studied MRI scans of 84 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 175 patients with mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, and 139 images of healthy brains. \"Our initial goal was to locate similarities in the patients with Alzheimer's disease to those with MCI, in the hopes of finding a method to predict [MCI patients'] likelihood of developing the disease,\" said lead study author Linda McEvoy, assistant project scientist at UCSD's department of radiology. Neuroimaging results for the patients with Alzheimer's disease were as expected, according to the study, which was published online in the journal Radiology. Atrophy, which is loss of brain tissue, was visible throughout the brain. The temporal and parietal lobes, which affect cognitive function, saw the most damage. What surprised researchers were the differences in images from the MCI patients. More than 50 percent of the brains in the MCI group showed atrophy similar to the Alzheimer's disease patients. The other half of the MCI patients showed only small amounts of tissue damage.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain the findings \u00bb . \"Although the symptoms for the entire MCI group were primarily memory problems, other parts of the brain were impacted in over half the group,\" McEvoy said. \"And even though these patients [with Alzheimer's-like atrophy] don't have problems with their cognitive function now, their MCI will likely develop to that in the future.\" Researchers also evaluated the brains of the MCI group one year after initial testing. They found that patients who earlier had mild cognitive impairment plus signs of atrophy were getting worse. Twenty-nine percent of the group had since been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the others had begun to show signs of more serious cognitive decline. The condition of patients in the MCI group whose scans showed minimal signs of atrophy the previous year remained about the same. \"Only 8 percent of this group had developed Alzheimer's disease. The rest of the patients were stable and their symptoms had not increased,\" McEvoy said. Bill Thies, chief medical and scientific officer for the Alzheimer's Association, underscored the significance of these findings. \"What this study really shows is how different people with MCI can be, despite having similar symptoms. We can now use this information to create new treatments,\" he said. There are several drugs on the market that treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, but none that prevent its progression. Clinical trials may be able to use this data to select a better pool of candidates when testing new drugs. \"If they use a MCI patient with loss of brain tissue, someone who we now know is progressing fast towards Alzheimer's disease, we'd be able to quickly figure out if drug 'X' is slowing things down or not helping at all,\" Thies added. In addition, researchers hope that within the next few years patients could regularly be tested by their physicians to determine their risk of developing  Alzheimer's. \"If nothing else it would be good information for their family members to have early on, to be better prepared for the future.\" McEvoy said. Over 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease and an estimated three and a half million have mild cognitive impairment.", "bb793bd352d5f327ca8581d1fae45012b0bcc665": "CNN Student News -- Welcome to CNN Student News, a daily commercial-free, ten-minute broadcast of the day's news geared for middle- and high-school students.

Since the end of 2003, the H5N1 virus has infected birds in over 60 countries in Africa, Asia and Europe. Five hundred fowl that had died in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region tested positive for the H5N1 virus, according to China's Ministry of Agriculture. In late January, China confirmed its sixth case of bird flu in a human. The ministry said at the time that, although further human bird flu cases were possible throughout China, there wouldn't be a large-scale outbreak, state run news agency Xinhua and CCTV reported. The country also announced it was setting up a nationwide network to test for the H5N1 virus. Following a bird flu outbreak in late January, India culled more than 4,000 birds in the remote northeastern state of Sikkim. Health officials also detected dozens of cases of upper respiratory infection among humans, but none of the patients had any history of handling sick poultry, a government spokesperson said. Sikkim borders Nepal and China. Since the end of 2003, the H5N1 virus has infected many species of birds in more than 60 countries in Africa, Asia and Europe. It has not been found in birds in North or South America or the Caribbean, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Human-to-human transmission of avian flu is rare, but the virus has passed from poultry to humans in some cases. It has killed more than 200 people since 2003. China reported its first human-to-human infection case in 2005.

A Phoenix, Arizona, school bus crossed over several lanes of traffic, crashing into several vehicles on Wednesday. Phoenix police officer James Holmes told CNN the bus struck two cars at an intersection as it approached an overpass on Interstate 10. The bus later crossed into oncoming lanes, causing a chain reaction of collisions. At least two cars overturned, and several passengers in the vehicles had to be cut out of the wreckage, authorities said. Holmes said the bus carrying 45 students came to a stop a mile from the first accident scene. He said panicked children began jumping from the bus and fled into the neighborhood.

A Mexican soldier guards the entrance at a Canc\u00fan police station where the military is investigating a murder. Francisco Velasco Delgado was detained by military officials early Monday and flown to Mexico City, where he was placed under 45 days of house arrest, according to the media reports. With Delgado's removal, the military has taken over the Canc\u00fan police force, several newspapers reported. Canc\u00fan Mayor Gregorio Sanchez Martinez said the move was made \"to facilitate all types of investigations into the triple murder that happened last week,\" the Diario de Yucatan newspaper said. Salvador Rocha Vargas, the secretary for public security for the state of Quintana Roo, will lead the police force. He said he will take all the pertinent measures \"to clean up the Canc\u00fan police,\" the Excelsior newspaper reported Tuesday. Retired Gen. Mauro Enrique Tello Quinonez's bullet-riddled body was found a week ago on a road outside Canc\u00fan. Authorities said he had been tortured before being shot 11 times. His aide and a driver also were tortured and killed. Quintana Roo state prosecutor Bello Melchor Rodriguez y Carrillo said last week there was no doubt Tello and the others were victims of organized crime. \"The general was the most mistreated,\" Rodriguez y Carrillo said at a news conference. \"He had burns on his skin and bones in his hands and wrists were broken.\" An autopsy revealed he also had broken knees. Tello had been appointed less than 24 hours earlier as a special drug-fighting consultant for Gregorio Sanchez Martinez, the mayor of the Benito Juarez municipality, which includes the city of Canc\u00fan. Tello, who retired from the army in January at the mandatory age of 63, had moved to the resort area three weeks ago. Mexico is undergoing an unprecedented wave of violence that some have likened to a civil war. The government is battling drug cartels as the traffickers fight each other for control of the lucrative illicit market. Tello was the second high-ranking army officer to be killed in the area in the past few years. Lt. Col. Wilfrido Flores Saucedo and his aide were gunned down on a Canc\u00fan street in 2006. That crime remains unsolved. The latest killings come as Mexico grapples with the highest violent-death rate in its history. Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora reported in December there had been around 5,400 slayings in 2008, more than double the 2,477 tallied in 2007. There already have been more than 400 drug-related killings this year, according to some news accounts.", "567a16c58ad968e6f56594039a5092c18d0f3cc6": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A sculpture of a giant white horse taller than the Statue of Liberty is set to tower over the countryside as part of an unusual scheme to help revive the fortunes of a depressed region of England. The 50-meter high horse will dominate the landscape around Ebbsfleet. The 50-meter equine artwork was Tuesday announced as the winner of a competition to design a landmark to dominate the skyline of the Ebbsfleet Valley, set to be a new stop on the Eurostar London-to-Paris rail link. Designed by artist Mark Wallinger -- whose previous work has included dressing in a bear suit and wandering around a gallery in Berlin -- the \u00a32 million ($3 million) horse will be one of the largest artworks in the UK. Wallinger's horse -- which echoes ancient white horse symbols carved into hillsides around Britain -- beat a shortlist of designs that included a tower of stacked cubes and giant steel nest. Victoria Pomery, head of the panel that selected the design, described the 33-times normal size horse as \"outstanding.\" \"Mark is a superb artist of world renown and his sculpture will become a real landmark for Ebbsfleet Valley and the whole region,\" she said.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi applauds after signing the State Children's Health Insurance legislation Friday. \"The tide is going a different way than a presidential veto would reflect,\" Pelosi, a California Democrat, said. \"It was with great friendship that I reached out to the president this morning to say that I was still praying that he would have a change of heart and sign this legislation.\" \"I think I have to pray a little harder, but I will not give up,\" Pelosi said. Pelosi's comments came a day after the Senate voted 67-29 for the measure, which would expand the State Children's Health Insurance program by up to 4 million children. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino on Friday said Bush still intends to veto the bill when it arrives at his desk. Perino also said the disagreement between Congress and the White House was a simple policy difference, not \"about who cares about children more than the other.\" \"The president is saying, 'Let's take care of the neediest children first, let's not put scarce federal dollars toward a program that was meant for the poorest children and let it creep up to middle-income families with incomes up to $83,000 a year,' \" Perino said. Bush and many Republicans contend that the program's original intent -- to give parents who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to buy private insurance coverage for their children -- would be changed under the current bill, prompting parents to wind up dropping private coverage their children already have to get cheaper coverage under the bill. Perino also objected that the rhetoric surrounding the SCHIP bill has become too heated. \"I think it is preposterous for people to suggest the president of the United States doesn't care about children, that he wants children to suffer,\" Perino said. The bill enjoys bipartisan support. Eighteen Republican senators Thursday night joined all the Democrats in voting for expanding the popular program from its current annual budget of $5 billion to $12 billion for the next five years. Four senators -- Republicans John McCain of Arizona and Sam Brownback of Kansas and Democrats Joseph Biden of Delaware and Barack Obama of Illinois -- did not vote. With the current program scheduled to expire Saturday, the White House encouraged Congress to send the president a continuing resolution extending the program. \"We should take this time to arrive at a more rational, bipartisan SCHIP reauthorization bill that focuses on children in poor families who don't currently have insurance, rather than raising taxes to cover people who already have private insurance,\" Perino added. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah was among those Republicans who split from the president. \"It's very difficult for me to be against a man I care so much for,\" he told his colleagues on the Senate floor prior to the vote. \"It's unfortunate that the president has chosen to be on what, to me, is clearly the wrong side of this issue.\" Though 67 votes in the 100-person chamber would suffice to overturn a veto, the House version, which was approved Tuesday, fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.

Hamas supporters stand on the rubble of a building hit by an Israeli strike that killed Hamas' interior minister. According to Amnesty International, at least 24 Palestinian men -- most of them civilians -- were shot and killed by Hamas gunmen during the recent Israeli offensive aimed at crippling the Hamas leadership in Gaza. \"Scores of others have been shot in the legs, kneecapped or inflicted with other injuries intended to cause permanent disability,\" the human rights organization said in a news release. Hamas leaders have publicly accused followers of its rival Palestinian political faction, Fatah, of spying for the Israelis during the conflict, and they have said many have been arrested for collaborating with the Jewish state. But they deny ordering any reprisal attacks against suspected spies, instead blaming rogue elements. The Israeli military offensive in Gaza was launched at the end of December and ended three weeks later, when Israeli forces withdrew under the terms of a cease-fire agreement. Amnesty said that the targets of \"Hamas' deadly campaign\" include prisoners who escaped from Gaza's central prison when Israeli forces bombed it in the initial days of the military conflict. Some prisoners injured in the Israeli bombing were \"shot dead in the hospitals where they were receiving treatment,\" Amnesty said. \"The perpetrators of these attacks did not conceal their weapons or keep a low profile, but, on the contrary, behaved in a carefree and confident -- almost ostentatious -- manner,\" it said. Other targets included former members of Palestinian Authority security forces and supporters of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party. Fatah, which is based in the West Bank, has denied spying on Hamas. Fatah leaders have accused Hamas of rounding up at least 175 of their members in Gaza during the Israeli war and torturing them. The two Palestinian factions have been locked in a power struggle since Hamas won parliamentary elections in January 2006 and wrested Gaza from Fatah in violent clashes the following year. Abbas is a U.S. ally and regularly negotiates with Israel as the Palestinian leader, but he holds little sway in Gaza. Fatah supporters have been accused of helping the Israeli military conduct its campaign in Gaza, which targeted the Hamas leadership. Neighbors of Hamas Interior Minister Said Siam said they suspected Fatah supporters helped Israel pinpoint his location when they bombed his house on January 15. Siam was highest-ranking Hamas member killed in the Israeli offensive. Most of those suspected of spying for Israel have been abducted from their homes and then \"dumped -- dead or injured -- in isolated areas,\" according to Amnesty International. During the Gaza conflict, medical officials at Gaza City's main medical facility, Shifa Hospital, said injuries they witnessed were consistent with people being shot in the kneecaps, elbows, hands or feet. Punishment shootings are a time-tested tactic used worldwide by guerrilla and militia groups, from Che Guevara in Cuba to the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland. They are meant not only to take revenge but also to send a message to others. Two self-described Fatah loyalists were found heavily bandaged at a Gaza City safe house during the recent conflict. One of their colleagues refused to say where or why they were injured, but they denied spying. \"They shot him at close range with a pistol,\" he said of one man. \"His bones are shattered. They shot him point-blank in the foot. ... This was done by Hamas people.\" The other man, he said, was struck on his legs with a metal construction bar. \"Four people were beating him,\" he said. A Hamas security source told CNN the shootings occurred because renegade gunmen took the law into their own hands. Ehad al-Ghossain, Hamas' Interior Ministry spokesman, said there was no official order within Hamas to carry out such shootings. \"That's not us,\" al-Ghossain said. \"Maybe some families who had problems in the past just wanted to shoot these people.\" CNN's Karl Penhaul contributed to this report .", "e202c989567db9ef534edbd3223698fb83f98e98": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iran's president said Tuesday his country welcomes talks with the United States \"in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect.\" Women in Tehran celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Islamic revolution Tuesday.

It's quite clear that real change should be fundamental, not just a tactical change, and it is quite clear that the Iranian nation will greet real changes.  \"The Iranian nation is ready to hold up talks, but talks in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect,\" Ahmadinejad said.

Watch news conference in full \u00bb . \"There's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight,\" Obama said. He said his administration is reviewing existing U.S. policy toward Iran, which supports groups Washington has branded terrorist organizations, such as Hezbollah and Hamas, and has defied U.N. demands to halt its uranium enrichment program. Despite those concerns, Obama said his administration wants to use \"all the resources at the United States' disposal\" to resolve those concerns. \"My expectation is, in the coming months, we will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table, face-to-face diplomatic overtures, that will allow us to move our policy in a new direction,\" Obama said. \"So there are going to be a set of objectives that we have in these conversations, but I think that there's the possibility at least of a relationship of mutual respect and progress.\" The United States and Iran have not had diplomatic relations since 1979. During that year, the Shah of Iran was forced to flee the country and the Ayatollah Khomeini took power. Later that year, Iranian students took over and seized hostages at the U.S. Embassy. Relations have been cut since then. U.S. President George W. Bush labeled Iran as a member of the \"axis of evil\" after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Iran celebrated the 30th anniversary of the revolution Tuesday with crowds chanting \"Death to America.\"  Watch the parade in Iran \u00bb . Tensions have rippled over issues such as Iran's nuclear program, Israel, and Iraq, and have been aggravated since the outspoken Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005. Western nations believe Iran is intent on building a nuclear weapon. Ahmadinejad has been criticized for his vehemence against and provocative remarks toward Israel and for Iran's support of Hamas militants in Gaza and the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon -- militants groups that Israel has battled. Also, the United States has accused Iran of backing Iraqi insurgents. In recent years, the Iraq conflict has provided an opportunity for Iran and the United States to cooperate since both countries support the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government and Iraqis have urged both countries to put aside their differences in helping Iraq. In 2007, U.S. and Iraqi envoys met several times in Baghdad. Ahmadinejad addressed the conflict in Iraq, saying that 1 million people have been killed and others have been displaced because of the \"Bush administration war on Iraq.\" \"To deal with the root cause of insecurity I think that we should go and find the main culprits, including Bush himself and his administration. They must be put on trial,\" said Ahmadinejad. \"The world does not want to see the dark age of Bush being repeated.\" Addressing the issue of terrorism, Ahmadinejad said Iran has been fighting terror for 30 years and that Iran itself been victimized by terror. \"If you want to fight terrorism in practice come and work with the Iranian nation,\" he said. \"If you want to eradicate the root causes of massacres and aggression, let's sit together and see what has been behind the reasons why we have had wars in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East.\" As usual, he had harsh words for Israel, a state he loathes and a topic that whips up passions among his supporters. \"If you want to eradicate crime, let's work together with the Iranian nation and other nations of the world and let's put on trial the Zionist leaders of the Zionist regime,\" the Iranian leader said. As for nuclear power, Iran has said it wants to harness it for energy and Ahmadinejad indicated Iran is against deploying nuclear weaponry. \"If you want to fight proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, then you should join us and help us so that we will show you the right way. Yes we're opposed to nuclear weapons of mass destruction. They're real threats and they must be destroyed. Iran has been a victim of the use of chemical weapons of mass destruction but the only way would be justice and the use of appropriate mechanisms,\" he said. \"If they really want to have real security, then they should be able to work with us and then we will be able to revisit the structure of the Security Council -- and remember the Security Council itself is the root cause of discrimination -- we should change this structure and then have justice.\" The United States also is concerned about Iran's technological pursuits. Iran successfully launched its first satellite into orbit last week, a step hailed by Iran's president as a \"source of pride\" for the Islamic republic, according to state-run news outlets. The launch of the satellite Omid -- which means \"Hope\" in Farsi -- was timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary celebrations of the Islamic revolution in Iran, according to Iranian media reports. U.S. Department of Defense officials confirmed the launch, and the State Department expressed \"grave concern.\" In August, Iran performed a test of a rocket capable of launching a satellite into orbit. Iranian officials declared that mission a success, but U.S. officials disputed that. Senior U.S. officials had expressed concerned about the test of the rocket, saying Iran could use the rocket to deliver warheads.

Whatever you do don't photograph wildlife and babies! Richard is off to find out why getting that perfect shot can often be next to impossible. Try getting either to stand still! Quest learns from the masters in both of these --- the acclaimed baby photographer Anne Geddes and, in San Francisco, award-winning wildlife photographer Frans Lanting. You just have to look at our news stands to see what a celebrity-obsessed culture we live in. Every few months a new gossip magazine emerges promising even better and more compromising pictures of celebrities at their best, at their worst, showing us what they're doing and what they definitely should not be doing. We are the voyeurs, and we just can't get enough of them. The paparazzi have spawned this celebrity culture showing celebrities as anything but perfect. In London Darren Lyons, snapper turned celebrity himself, tells us how his business really works. But while we all love to curl up with a good gossip magazine, most of these photos will never be remembered. But there are photos that will endure, like those taken at our weddings. The wedding photographer is one of the honest jobs in the business. We visit a wedding in L.A. and capture a couple's special moments. Finally, Quest is back with Frans Lanting in San Francisco. And this time he is the one taking the photographs. They go to the Ano Nuevo state reserve to photograph a colony of elephant seals. To view more of Frans Lanting's work please click here.

Klose scored a vital goal for Bayern as they claimed a 1-0 Bundesliga victory at Karlsruhe. Klose converted Massimo Oddo's cross on 86 minutes to give Jurgen Klinsmann's side three league points for the first time this month despite another unimpressive performance. Bayern last picked up three points in a Bundesliga game on September 13 when they hammered Cologne 3-0. Since then the gloss on Jurgen Klinsmann's first season in charge has faded badly after Werder Bremen hammered his side 5-2 at home on September 20 and then slumped to a 1-0 defeat at minnows Hanover the following week. Cries of \"Klinsmann out!\" were first heard around Munich's Allianz Arena in their previous league game on October 4 when a poor Bochum side were allowed to score two goals in the last 10 minutes to poach a 3-3 draw. Despite their first-half domination in Karlsruhe, Bayern could not break down the home defense and lost striker Luca Toni, the league's top scorer last season, who limped off after 40 minutes to be replaced by Lukas Podolski. And another of Munich top attacking options from last season was substituted on 59 minutes when Klinsmann switched France midfielder Franck Ribery for Germany's Tim Borowski. With Karlsruhe unable to create any chances and Bayern unable to convert theirs, it looked like the game was heading towards a 0-0 draw until Klose struck. But Klinsmann's side will need to do much better against Fiorentina in Tuesday night's Champions League game in Munich. Promoted Hoffenheim went top of the table with a flurry of late goals to seal a 5-2 victory at 10-man Hanover which put them level with Hamburg but leading the table on goal difference. Two goals from Hoffenheim's Vedad Ibisevic led the charge and made the Bosnian and Herzegovina striker the league's top scorer with nine so far this season. However, Hamburg have the chance to recapture top spot when they host Schalke on Sunday. Also on Saturday, Bayer Leverkusen moved up one place to third place thanks to their 2-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Striker Patrick Helmes scored his eighth league goal of the season when he converted a penalty after just six minutes and a 61st minute header from Chilean midfielder Arturo Vidal sealed the win. Stuttgart drop from third to sixth in the table after losing 2-1 at Hertha Berlin while Wolfsburg picked up their first league win for nearly a month as midfielder Zvjezdan Misimovic netted first-half goals in a 4-1 win over Arminia Bielefeld to put Felix Magath's side fifth in the table. Ten-man Energie Cottbus lost 1-0 at Cologne to stay in the bottom three while Dortmund scored in injury time to seal a 3-3 draw at Werder Bremen.", "3a74a105eef5416699d68bcb1838b7b20bd20cd2": "MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN) -- Ethiopian troops have not yet begun to withdraw from key positions in the capital of Somalia two days after they were supposed to do so under a peace agreement designed to end years of conflict. Ethiopian troops are yet to leave the Somlai capital despite a peace agreement. The Ethiopians had agreed to withdraw from some bases by Friday under an agreement signed last month by the Somali transitional government and a rebel faction known as the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. Ethiopia invaded Somalia two years ago to expel Islamic forces who had conquered Mogadishu. Under the deal signed October 26, a cease-fire between the transitional government and the ARS went into effect November 5. The Ethiopians were to withdraw from from key positions in the capital on November 21, and leave the country entirely early in 2009. Somali Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein has said that Ethiopian troops will withdraw as agreed. Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, a moderate leader of the rebel ARS, told the local radio station Shabelle Saturday that the Ethiopian troops would pull out on schedule. Insurgents clashed with Somali government forces and their Ethiopian allies Friday, witnesses said, leaving at least 11 fighters dead. The fighting started when armed insurgent fighters attacked the house of a local commissioner in Mogadishu's Wadajir district, sparking heavy fighting between the government troops guarding the house and the insurgents. \"I saw 11 men wearing red turbans on the heads dead on the ground,\" local resident Mohamed Haji Ali told CNN by phone from a house near where the clashes took place. Other residents provided a similar death toll. The commissioner whose house was attacked, Ahmed Da'd, said that his soldiers killed 17 insurgents. He displayed what he said were some of the dead insurgents for the media. It is not clear what will happen if the Ethiopian troops remain in Mogadishu despite the October 26 peace deal. Under that agreement, government and opposition members will form a 10,000-member joint police force to keep order, along with the African Union peacekeeping mission now in place and a U.N. force to be deployed later. Both sides will work toward establishing a unity government in Somalia, which has been riven by 17 years of strife since the collapse of its last fully functional government. Ethiopia invaded Somalia in December 2006 to install the transitional government in Mogadishu after a decade and a half of near-anarchy. The invasion had the blessing of the United States, which accused the Islamic Courts Union -- which captured Mogadishu earlier that year -- of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda. The Islamists responded with a guerrilla campaign against government and Ethiopian troops. Efforts to replace the Ethiopians with an African Union-led peacekeeping mission faltered as the violence worsened, and heavy fighting in Mogadishu and other cities drove hundreds of thousands from their homes. The lawlessness also spilled on to the seas off the Horn of Africa, where international vessels are routinely hijacked by suspected Somali pirates who demand large ransoms. Journalist Abdinasir Mohamed Guled and CNN's Mohammed Amiin and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.", "06a2c3475ec2077a99483c735cd8aee2384af699": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- From bedroom creators to big studios, hand-drawn to CGI, animation has charmed and entertained children -- and, increasingly, adults -- for many years. The Screening Room went to Annecy in France to discover the secrets of success in animated films... Annecy has hailed animators like director Tim Burton, seen here receiving a special award at Annecy in 2006. Annecy is the Cannes of animation. The French town, which lies close to the Swiss border just 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Geneva, has hosted the International Animated Film Festival for almost half a century and attracts a younger crowd than many of the major film festivals. With prizes for long and short features, television and student animation, Annecy highlights a wide variety of different types of animation and budgets. One veteran of Annecy is Craig Decker, known as worldwide cult figure \"Spike\" and co-founder of \"Spike and Mike's Sick & Twisted Festival of Animation.\" Beginning 30 years ago as a means of bringing independent animation to new audiences, the touring festival was instrumental in showcasing the early works of legendary animators such as Tim Burton, Pixar's John Lasseter and Aardman's Nick Park, as well as the first episode of \"Beavis and Butthead.\" Spike explained to CNN the challenge of getting animation taken seriously. He said, \"Originally we had to deal with the stigma. We showed great films like National Film Board of Canada [pieces], or \"Tin Toy\" by John Lasseter, works of art, masterpieces that take two to three years to make, and we had to deal with, 'What is it? Cartoons like Bugs Bunny or something like that?' And over the years we've educated the public, and we've put animation in the context of a very cool thing [with] a young, hip, adult audience of 18 and over.\" Stop-motion classics . One of Spike and Mike's biggest fans, Nick Park, won the Annecy award for Best TV Animation with \"Shaun the Sheep,\" a spin-off from \"A Close Shave,\" one of Aardman's famous Wallace and Gromit short features that grabbed an Oscar. Stop-motion is also close to the heart of director Tim Burton, who employed the technique on \"Corpse Bride\" and \"The Nightmare Before Christmas.\" He said, \"Because it's such an old-fashioned technique, a lot of it truly has to do with finding the right group of animators, the right group of people to build the puppets, because a lot of things are being done by computer now. Very few people are doing this style of animation.\" Allison Abbate, a producer on \"Corpse Bride,\" added, \"Stop motion is an age-old process as far as animation in film-making goes. It hasn't really changed since the days of King Kong - we used new technology in 'Corpse Bride' to bring it into a new century.\" Appropriate animation . \"I think there's room for all types of animation,\" she continued. \"It depends on the story. The story should really decide how you tell it. I think there are stories that are better made in 2-D and CGI and that's what you'd go for.\" 2-D animation is the mainstay of Japanese anime - a subject so vast it will command its own feature in a subsequent edition of the Screening Room. The film \"Paprika\" has won worldwide critical praise during the past year as a sophisticated example of the art, whose keenest supporters are sometimes contemptuous of their Hollywood animation counterparts. Asia is becoming an increasingly powerful force in animation, where companies who traditionally provided a cheap source of labor for animation studios are now using their skills to take a leading role in the creative process. UTV Toons is one of several Indian companies forming partnerships with big U.S. production houses to make new animated features. Combination of skills . Animation requires a combination of several skills, as producer Allison Abbate explained. She told CNN that animators face many complex challenges. \"Animators have to know how to move things, how things work anatomically in a space, but they also have to know how to act, how to emote and that is what makes animation so different from live action. It is so crafted, one frame at a time.\" But Spike points out that the rewards animation promises can be very high. \"Obviously in features, look at the most successful films,\" he told CNN. \"They're nearly all animated Pixar pieces or, if it's live action, it's the special effects animation that carries the film.\" And the future? Spike believes animation is going mobile. He said, \"Internationally, what's exciting is with new media: with digital; with broadband; with mobile phones. That's where we're going with our stuff.\" E-mail to a friend .", "99ba3d1cc315f0e927108f7feeedc41de6e34b46": "(CNN)  -- Here's a tip for dairy farmers: If you want your cows to produce more milk, get to know them better. Herdsman Paul Nelson of Eachwick Red House Farm, Newcastle, England, with Highlight the cow. So says a study out of Newcastle University in northeast England, published online Wednesday in the academic journal Anthrozoos. The researchers found that farmers who named their cows Betsy or Gertrude or Daisy improved their overall milk yield by almost 500 pints (284 liters) annually. \"Just as people respond better to the personal touch, cows also feel happier and more relaxed if they are given a bit more one-to-one attention,\" Catherine Douglas of the university's School of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development said in a news release. \"By placing more importance on the individual, such as calling a cow by her name or interacting with the animal more as it grows up, we can not only improve the animal's welfare and her perception of humans, but also increase milk production.\" Douglas and her colleagues questioned 516 dairy farmers in the United Kingdom. Almost half said they called the cows on their farms by name and reported a higher milk yield. A press statement from the university, touting the study, quoted Dennis Gibb, who co-owns a dairy farm outside of Newcastle, called Eachwick Red House Farm. \"We love our cows here at Eachwick, and every one of them has a name,\" Gibb said. \"Collectively, we refer to them as 'our ladies,' but we know every one of them and each one has her own personality.\"", "500d36ba2bc69c9436fdb45566bc88a30a69dd4e": "(CNN) -- Personal computer maker Lenovo, expecting to report a loss for the third fiscal quarter ending December 31, announced it would cut 2,500 jobs as part of a restructuring expected to save $300 million. A woman walks past a Lenovo advertisement at a computer shop in Hong Kong. The cuts comprise about 11 percent of the Chinese computer manufacturer's global workforce. \"Although the integration of the IBM PC business for the past three years was a success, our last quarter's performance did not meet our expectations,\" Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's chairman of the board, said in a statement. \"We are taking these actions now to ensure that in an uncertain economy, our business operates as efficiently and effectively as possible, and continues to grow in the future.\" Hong Kong's Hang Seng index suspended trading of Lenovo shares Wednesday, anticipating the announcement.

Authorities recently seized these .50-caliber bullets, already belted to be fed into a machine gun. In Mexico, guns are difficult to purchase legally. So, officials say, weapons easily purchased in the United States are turning up there. \"The same routes that are being used to traffic drugs north -- and the same organizations that have control over those routes -- are the same organizations that bring the money and the cash proceeds south as well as the guns and the ammunition,\" says Bill Newell, a special agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Police in Mexican border towns fear for their lives, and with good reason. Five high-ranking Mexican police officials have been killed this year in what Mexican officials say is an escalating war between police and drug cartels. In Juarez, Mexico, just across the border from El Paso, Texas, a police commander was gunned down in front of his home. The weapon used to kill Cmdr. Francisco Ledesma Salazar is believed to have been a .50-caliber rifle. The guns are illegal to purchase in Mexico but can be obtained just north of the border at gun shows and gun shops in the United States. ATF special agent Tom Mangan says the .50-caliber rifle has become one of the \"guns of choice\" for the drug cartels. The weapon fires palm-sized .50-caliber rounds that can cut through just about anything. Mangan showed CNN the power of the rifle on a gun range near Phoenix, Arizona. The weapon, a Barrett, was seized in an ATF raid. A round fired from 100 yards away tore through a car door and both sides of a bulletproof vest like those used by Mexican police. \"There's nothing that's going to stop this round,\" Mangan says. The rifle was intercepted as it was being smuggled into Mexico. Mangan says investigators believe four others already had passed through the border.  Watch how the weapons fuel a little-known war \u00bb . The ATF has been trying to help Mexican police by cracking down on illegal purchases of guns and ammunition. Operation Gunrunner has led to several arrests and seizures of guns and ammo. But the operation has mainly shown just how big a problem exists, authorities say. One recent seizure in a Yuma, Arizona, storage locker yielded 42 weapons and hundreds of rounds of .50-caliber bullets already belted to be fed into a machine gun-style weapon. The guns confiscated included AK-47 rifles and dozens of Fabrique National pistols. The semiautomatic pistols fire a 5.7-by-28 millimeter round, which is technically a rifle round, according to the ATF. Newell says the round has a special nickname in Mexico. \"It's called 'mata policias,' or 'cop killer,' \" he says. Mexican authorities along the border recently met with their counterparts in the United States, hoping more cooperation will lead to more arrests of criminals and fewer killings of Mexican police officers. Guillermo Fonseca, Mexico's regional legal attach\u00e9 for the West Coast, told CNN the violence in his country is \"problem number 1\" -- and police in his country are outgunned. Officers in Mexico lack heavy firepower, he says. With the presence of large-caliber weapons from the United States, drug cartels and criminals have the advantage in what he says is basically a war. Part of the solution, he says, is for the United States to give Mexico more information about who is selling these guns illegally in the United States. Then Mexico could go after the buyers. \"We have access to systems to trace guns that have been smuggled into Mexico, and that has worked very well,\" Fonseca told CNN. \"We need more information about the people who are actually purchasing the guns. We need to prosecute those people, to convict those people. In our opinion, that's the next step we have to take.\" Last year Mexican police confiscated 10,000 guns and $200 million in raids aimed at cracking down on border violence. Still, local police tread carefully, especially in neighborhoods controlled by the powerful drug cartels. Officer Cesar Quitana patrols a dangerous barrio in Juarez, Mexico. He is armed with an M16 assault rifle -- a weapon that would be no match in a gunfight with drug lords. \"I think most of us feel scared just to bring this with us,\" he says, pointing to the rifle in the front seat of his patrol car. \"But this is what we use to defend ourselves.\" E-mail to a friend .

The bomb explodes near Bhutto's vehicle following a political rally in Rawalpindi. The conclusions of the inquiry were outlined in a detailed report handed over to interim Interior Minister Hamid Nawaz by Detective Superintendent John MacBrayne, accompanied by a senior official from the British High Commission, during a meeting in Islamabad. The text of the executive summary of the report is as follows: . On the 27th December 2007, Mohtarma Benazir BHUTTO, the leader of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), died as a result of being attacked in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Following discussions between the Prime Minister and President Musharraf, it was agreed that officers from the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) should support the investigation into Ms Bhutto's death. The primary focus of the Scotland Yard team was to assist the Pakistani authorities in establishing the cause and circumstances of Ms Bhutto's death. The wider investigation to establish culpability has remained entirely a matter for the Pakistani authorities. The SO15 team was led by a Detective Superintendent Senior Investigating Officer, and comprised two forensic experts, an expert in analysing and assessing video media and an experienced investigating officer. The team arrived in Pakistan on 4th January 2008 and spent two and a half weeks conducting extensive enquiries. During the course of their work, the team were joined by other specialists from the United Kingdom. The UK team were given extensive support and co-operation by the Pakistani authorities, Ms Bhutto's family, and senior officials from Ms Bhutto's party. The task of establishing exactly what happened was complicated by the lack of an extended and detailed search of the crime scene, the absence of an autopsy, and the absence of recognised body recovery and victim identification processes. Nevertheless, the evidence that is available is sufficient for reliable conclusions to be drawn. Within the overall objective, a particular focus has been placed on establishing the actual cause of death, and whether there were one or more attackers in the immediate vicinity of Ms Bhutto. The cause of death . Considerable reliance has been placed upon the X-rays taken at Rawalpindi General Hospital following Ms Bhutto's death. Given their importance, the x-rays have been independently verified as being of Ms Bhutto by comparison with her dental x-rays. Additionally, a valuable insight was gained from the accounts given by the medical staff involved in her treatment, and from those members of Ms Bhutto's family who washed her body before burial. Ms Bhutto's only apparent injury was a major trauma to the right side of the head. The UK experts all exclude this injury being an entry or exit wound as a result of gunshot. The only X-ray records, taken after her death, were of Ms Bhutto's head. However, the possibility of a bullet wound to her mid or lower trunk can reasonably be excluded. This is based upon the protection afforded by the armoured vehicle in which she was travelling at the time of the attack, and the accounts of her family and hospital staff who examined her. The limited X-ray material, the absence of a full post mortem examination and CT scan, have meant that the UK Home Office pathologist, Dr Nathaniel Cary, who has been consulted in this case, is unable categorically to exclude the possibility of there being a gunshot wound to the upper trunk or neck. However when his findings are put alongside the accounts of those who had close contact with Ms Bhutto's body, the available evidence suggests that there was no gunshot injury. Importantly, Dr Cary excludes the possibility of a bullet to the neck or upper trunk as being a relevant factor in the actual cause of death, when set against the nature and extent of her head injury. In his report Dr Cary states: . \u2022 \"the only tenable cause for the rapidly fatal head injury in this case is that it occurred as the result of impact due to the effects of the bomb-blast.\" \u2022 \"in my opinion Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto died as a result of a severe head injury sustained as a consequence of the bomb-blast and due to head impact somewhere in the escape hatch of the vehicle.\" Given the severity of the injury to Ms Bhutto's head, the prospect that she inadvertently hit her head whilst ducking down into the vehicle can be excluded as a reasonable possibility. High explosives of the type typically used in this sort of device, detonate at a velocity between 6000 and 9000 metres per second. This means that when considering the explosive quantities and distances involved, such an explosion would generate significantly more force than would be necessary to provoke the consequences as occurred in this case. It is also important to comment upon the construction of the vehicle. It was fitted with B6 grade armour and designed to withstand gunfire and bomb-blast. It is an unfortunate and misleading aspect of this case that the roof escape hatch has frequently been referred to as a sunroof. It is not. It is designed and intended to be used solely as a means of escape. It has a solid lip with a depth of 9cm. Ms Bhutto's injury is entirely consistent with her head impacting upon the lip of the escape hatch. Detailed analysis of the media footage provides supporting evidence. Ms Bhutto's head did not completely disappear from view until 0.6 seconds before the blast. She can be seen moving forward and to the right as she ducked down into the vehicle. Whilst her exact head position at the time of the detonation can never be ascertained, the overwhelming conclusion must be that she did not succeed in getting her head entirely below the lip of the escape hatch when the explosion occurred. How many people were involved in the immediate attack? There has been speculation that two individuals were directly involved in the attack. The suggestion has been that one suspect fired shots, and a second detonated the bomb. All the available evidence points toward the person who fired shots and the person who detonated the explosives being one and the same person. \u2022 Body parts from only one individual remain unidentified. Expert opinion provides strong evidence that they originate from the suicide bomber. \u2022 Analysis of the media footage places the gunman at the rear of the vehicle and looking down immediately before the explosion. The footage does not show the presence of any other potential bomber.  \u2022 This footage when considered alongside the findings of the forensic explosive expert, that the bombing suspect was within 1 to 2 metres of the vehicle towards it rear and with no person or other obstruction between him and the vehicle, strongly suggests that the bomber and gunman were at the same position. It is virtually inconceivable that anyone who was where the gunman can clearly be seen on the media footage, could have survived the blast and escaped. The inevitable conclusion is that there was one attacker in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle in which Ms Bhutto was travelling. In essence, all the evidence indicates that one suspect has fired the shots before detonating an improvised explosive device. At the time of the attack this person was standing close to the rear of Ms Bhutto's vehicle. The blast caused a violent collision between her head and the escape hatch area of the vehicle, causing a severe and fatal head injury.

People in New Delhi, India, take part in a candlelight vigil for the victims of the Mumbai attacks on Sunday. Her comments to CNN's \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer\" were the most definitive made by a top-ranking U.S. official regarding Pakistan's connection to the November 26-29 attack on Mumbai, in which more than 170 were killed and hundreds of others were wounded. \"Well, I think there's no doubt that Pakistani territory was used by probably non-state actors,\" Rice said. \"I don't think that there is compelling evidence of involvement of Pakistani officials. But I do think that Pakistan has a responsibility to act, and it doesn't matter that they're non-state actors.\" Last week, Rice traveled to the region to try to ease tension between India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers and key allies of the United States. While in New Delhi, India, she called on Pakistan to take responsibility for terrorists operating within its borders. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has said \"stateless actors\" carried out the attack while Indian authorities say they believe all the attackers were Pakistanis, specifically blaming Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), an Islamic militant group based in Pakistan. U.S. counterterrorism officials say signs point to LeT, and they haven't seen anything to rule it out. However, they have not definitively said the group is responsible. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell said during an appearance Tuesday at Harvard University that the Mumbai attacks were carried out by the same group responsible for the parliament attack and a series of bomb explosions aboard trains and at railway stations in Mumbai in 2006 -- though he didn't specifically name LeT. LeT has denied any responsibility for the attacks, but a suspect in custody -- whom India has said was one of 10 gunmen in the attacks -- told interrogators he was trained by LeT, Indian authorities said. India said its forces killed nine gunmen. On Sunday, Rice said LeT and al Qaeda \"tend to travel in the same circles,\" though she declined to directly link either group to the Mumbai attack. But she stressed that Pakistan is obligated to root out terrorists within its borders. \"Well, I don't want to go into too much detail here because, obviously, in counterterrorism no one wants to tip the hand of what has happened here and what may happen in the future,\" Rice said. \"The important thing now is to get these perpetrators and to prevent follow-on attacks. And Pakistan's cooperation, Pakistan's action, is absolutely essential to doing that.\" Asked about possible ties between Pakistan's government and LeT, Rice acknowledged \"there have been historic ties -- there's no doubt about that.\" \"But Pakistan is a different place now with a civilian government and an army leadership that is working in concert to try to bring an end to extremism within Pakistan,\" she said. \"We have to remember that Pakistan itself has been suffering at the hands of extremism. So whatever the history here, and there is a history, the important thing is that Pakistan act against those who used Pakistani soil to perpetrate attacks.\"", "d86cefefb323606366763661f9ce20f787fffcc5": "LONE GROVE, Oklahoma (CNN) -- A scene of devastation emerged Wednesday as circling helicopters broadcast images of housing developments smashed by tornadoes and severe storms that killed at least eight people in south-central Oklahoma Tuesday.

Students gather outside a destroyed school on January 17 in Kundar in Pakistan's Swat Valley. A day earlier, radical cleric Maulana Fazlullah threatened to kill more than four dozen government officials if they did not appear before him for opposing the Taliban. Local newspapers on Monday printed the list of 50 government officials and tribal elders whom Fazlullah has threatened with death. The boy's high school that was destroyed was located in Mingora, the valley's main city, said Sher Afzal Khan, an education officer for Swat. The attack occurred early Monday and no one was wounded. Swat Valley, located in North West Frontier Province, was once Pakistan's biggest tourist destination. It is situated near the Afghanistan border and about 186 miles (300 km) from the capital city of Islamabad. The valley boasted the country's only ski resort and was a draw for trout-fishing enthusiasts until it was overrun by militants, led by Fazlullah. He has launched a violent and deadly campaign to enforce Taliban-style fundamentalist Islamic laws throughout the province. The militants want to require veils for women and beards for men, and to ban music and television. The central government has long exerted little control in the area, but it launched an intense military offensive in late July to flush out militants. As retaliation for the military presence, the Taliban has carried out a series of deadly bombings, and has said the attacks will continue until the troops pull out. Elsewhere in the North West Frontier Province, a blast killed five people and wounded 15 others Monday morning, officials said.

Under a plea deal, Christine Beatty, shown in August at an arraignment in Detroit, will serve five years probation. Beatty pleaded guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice, according to Maria Miller, the prosecutor's spokeswoman. Charges of perjury and misconduct against Beatty will be dropped as part of the plea arrangement, she said. Beatty agreed to a plea arrangement under which she will serve five years probation -- the first 120 days to be served in jail -- and pay a $100,000 fine, \"based on [Beatty's] ability to pay,\" Miller said. Beatty will begin serving her jail sentence on January 5, when she will be formally sentenced, Miller said. Kym L. Worthy, prosecuting attorney for Wayne County, released a statement saying she is \"very pleased that this defendant admitted her guilt.\" \"We live in an age where greed and protecting one's secrets is glorified and accepted,\" Worthy said. \"Now the city of Detroit, the region and the state of Michigan can truly begin to move forward when this ugly chapter in Detroit's history is put to rest.\" In September, Kilpatrick resigned as mayor and pleaded guilty to two felony obstruction of justice charges stemming from his efforts to cover up his relationship with Beatty. Like Beatty, Kilpatrick was sentenced to five years probation with the first four months to be served in jail. He is serving that sentence in the Wayne County jail. At the time of his sentencing in October, the judge in the case called Kilpatrick \"arrogant and defiant,\" particularly for a televised speech that aired hours after Kilpatrick entered his pleas. \"That night, the community expected to hear a message of humility, remorse and apology,\" Wayne County Circuit Judge David Groner said at Kilpatrick's sentencing. \"Instead, we heard an arrogant and defiant man who accused the governor, among others, for his downfall.\" In addition to his jail and probation sentence, Kilpatrick must also pay the city of Detroit $1 million in restitution, and forfeit any future pension. Initially, Kilpatrick was accused of blocking a criminal investigation into his office and firing a police deputy to cover up an affair with Beatty, then his chief of staff. When that deputy, Gary Brown, filed a whistle-blower suit, Kilpatrick and Beatty denied under oath that an affair had taken place between them. Text messages that contradicted Kilpatrick's and Beatty's denials of an affair were made public in January by the Detroit Free Press, and county prosecutor Worthy charged Kilpatrick and Beatty with multiple counts of perjury, obstruction of justice and misconduct in office. The most serious charges would have carried a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison upon conviction. Beatty resigned her post after the text messages were made public. Kilpatrick initially refused to resign after the scandal broke, and Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm called a hearing on whether she should remove him from office at the request of the Detroit City Council.

Stoves in danger of tipping over can be fixed for free under terms of a settlement announced Wednesday. According to the court-approved agreement, Sears will notify nearly 4 million customers who may have bought stoves between July 2000 and September 2007 that they either can get anti-tip safety brackets installed for free or receive gift cards or reimbursements of up to $100 to qualifying customers. The brackets keep the appliances bolted to the floor or wall to prevent them from tipping over. Such accidents have caused more than 100 deaths or injuries, mostly from scalding and burns, according to the nonprofit consumer group Public Citizen. The value of the settlement depends on how many customers respond to Sears' offer, but Public Citizen said it could end up costing the retailer more than $545 million.  Watch to see if your stove is in danger of tipping \u00bb . In addition to paying $17 million in legal fees, Sears will install brackets on all new stoves for free for the next three years. \"This agreement by Sears and the lawyers for the consumer is a real deal,\" said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen. \"This is a fantastic deal for a lawsuit to make this headway and get the protection for the consumer.\" Sears Holdings Corp. spokesman Chris Brathwaite said the plaintiffs' counsel is overestimating the settlement's monetary value. \"The parties dispute many aspects of the case, including the value on this settlement -- which Sears estimates to be a small fraction of what plaintiffs' counsel estimates,\" Brathwaite said in a statement. Claybrook and other consumer advocates said they would like the Consumer Product Safety Commission to require anti-tip brackets for all stove installations. Installing brackets is now voluntary. Claybrook said the agreement \"sets a model for what the Consumer Product Safety Commission should do and should have done. They've known about it for 25 years and done nothing.\" She said an amendment requiring anti-tip stove devices should be added to Senate legislation intended to beef up the safety commission.

Clara Rojas appears in a video released by the kidnappers in July 2002. \"There is a very high probability that Juan David belongs to the family of Clara Gonzalez de Rojas,\" Mario Iguaran Arana, the country's chief federal prosecutor, said at a news conference. The boy, known as \"Emmanuel,\" has been at the center of a hostage drama that raised hopes the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia would liberate some of their hostages. The rebel group, known as FARC for its Spanish acronym, had agreed to release three hostages as part of a deal brokered by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. FARC said it would release Emmanuel along with his mother, Clara Rojas, and another woman, Consuelo Gonzalez, but the mission to free the captives fell apart December 31, when the rebel group said it could not release the hostages because of Colombian military operations in the area, according to a FARC statement Chavez read on Venezuelan television. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe denied the group's assertion, saying there were no combat operations in the area near the rebels, and he said the rebels could not release the three hostages because they did not have Emmanuel in custody. He raised the possibility that Emmanuel, who was born in captivity to Rojas, was living in a foster home in the Colombian capital of Bogota. Authorities in Colombia suspect the FARC duped child-welfare authorities by presenting the boy as a child in need of foster care in 2005, he said. On Friday, Iguaran Arana said initial DNA results will be checked against tests being done in European labs to verify the child's identity. There was no immediate response from Venezuela after the announcement concerning Emmanuel's DNA. However, a statement on the Venezuelan government's Web site from earlier Friday said the Colombian government had not allowed Venezuela to participate in the DNA testing. Established in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party, FARC is Colombia's oldest, largest, most capable and best-equipped Marxist rebel group, according to the U.S. Department of State. The United States, the European Union and Colombia classify it as a terrorist group. FARC has justified hostage-taking as a legitimate military tactic in a long-running and complex civil war that also has involved right-wing paramilitary units, government forces and drug traffickers. Fighting has waned, but not stopped, in recent years. Among the group's hostages are three American contractors who were captured when their plane went down in 2003 during a drug-eradication flight, and Ingrid Betancourt, a French-Colombian independent presidential candidate who was kidnapped in 2002.

Colombian President Alvaro Uribe says he's releasing the information to help the government's fight against fraud. Uribe said he is releasing the information because some of the people running the frauds have told potential investors that he and his sons also have invested or are otherwise involved.

Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, Somalia's new president, answers questions at the African Union summit in Addis Ababa. He once led the Islamic Courts Union, which ruled much of Somalia in 2006 before it was routed by the Ethiopians. Now, Ahmed is the leader of Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government -- and two days after his election to the post of president, he was welcomed with open arms at an African Union summit in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. Two years after the invasion and the guerrilla war it provoked, Somalia has in some ways come full circle. Islamist militias control the country's capital and other key cities; the transitional government is trying to establish a foothold from outside the country; and Ahmed -- commonly known as \"Sheikh Sharif\" -- is in a position of power. But several analysts who have studied the region say the new government is in a much stronger position to establish itself inside Somalia and restore order to a country that has been mired in chaos for the past two decades. \"The ascendancy of Sheikh Sharif provides an opportunity to create an inclusive coalition governing from the center outwards,\" said John Prendergast, co-chairman of the Enough Project, who studies the Horn of Africa for the Center for American Progress think tank. The transitional government is currently stranded in Djibouti, unable to return to Somalia after its base in Baidoa was seized last week by Al-Shabaab, a radical Islamist militia with ties to al Qaeda. Ahmed now stands at a crossroads between quelling the militia, which once was aligned with the ICU, and including more moderates in his future government, Prendergast said. \"The fulcrum for change is in the hands of Sheikh Sharif's government,\" he said. \"If he is able to put together an inclusive government -- even if it's only on paper, even if it's only in Djibouti -- I think it will quickly defuse any fervor of support for Shabaab.\"  See a list of Somalia's key players \u00bb . Rise of Al-Shabaab . Al-Shabaab fighters took control of Baidoa hours after the remaining Ethiopian forces withdrew under a June 2008 cease-fire deal. Rashid Abdi, a Somalia analyst for the International Crisis Group, said the loss of Baidoa is \"a clear indication that the transitional federal government has lost any grip -- whatever grip it had -- in Somalia.\" But Prendergast said the radical Islamist militia will most likely lose support among Somalis now that its \"rallying cry\" of getting the Ethiopian forces out of Somalia is gone. \"What the Islamists did was, they wrapped themselves up in the mantle of Somali nationalism and, for the last two years, they have hitched their star to throwing the Ethiopians out,\" he said. Prendergast predicted that Al-Shabaab fighters \"will sustain themselves for awhile and temporarily expand, but I don't envision it to be a long-term prospect at all.\" Last year, the United States put Al-Shabaab -- which means \"The Youth\" -- on its list of terrorist groups. Analysts say Al-Shabaab models itself after the Taliban's puritanical Islamic rule.  See a timeline of recent events in Somalia \u00bb . Stig Jarle Hansen, a Nairobi, Kenya-based expert on Somalia for the Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research, said Al-Shabaab fighters have been trained in Afghanistan, and the group has \"clear connections\" to al Qaeda. There has been evidence that the group has extended its reach into the United States, as well. The FBI is investigating what appears to be a massive recruitment effort by Al-Shabaab in the United States' Somali communities, particularly in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where more than a dozen young men of Somali descent have gone missing in recent months. One member of Minneapolis' Somali community, Shirwa Ahmed, 27, blew himself up in an apparent suicide bombing in northern Somalia in October. Also, hours before U.S. President Barack Obama took the oath of office in January, the FBI was warned of a possible terrorist attack by Al-Shabaab that was timed to coincide with his inauguration. Prendergast said he expects Al-Shabaab's overseas ties to dry up now that its \"clarion call\" against Ethiopian forces is no longer valid. \"Now that that fight is over, I don't see that money continuing, and I don't see the recruitment from Somalis like places from Minneapolis to continue successfully,\" he said. And Ken Menkhaus, a Davidson College professor and former adviser to U.N. missions in Somalia in the 1990s, said the militia's efforts to govern the territory it holds in southern Somalia has had mixed results, alienating many Somalis by imposing hardline Islamic law. Al-Shabaab now has to justify its continued presence \"on the basis of what it's for -- and what it's for is not very popular among Somalis,\" Menkhaus said. The group is fraught with internal divisions and has already clashed with other militias over control of key neighborhoods in Mogadishu, he said. But if Al-Shabaab did manage to establish a government, there would be a \"genuine fear\" that al Qaeda could try to gain a foothold there. \"It would guarantee proxy wars and conflicts between Somalis and non-Somalis that would just perpetuate this conflict,\" Menkhaus said. Military intervention in Somalia? The United States has conducted periodic airstrikes against Islamist leaders since 2006 and has long viewed Somalia as a possible haven for al Qaeda. But military intervention would not only be unpopular, it would only empower Al-Shabaab by handing it back its \"raison d'etre,\" Prendergast said. \"You don't immediately confront a group like this -- they are at their high point,\" he said. \"You fight it politically and draw support slowly and patiently ... for clans and organizations in Somalia that don't really want them there. \"Area by area, they'll kick them out, unless they make the mistake of sending U.N. troops.\" Susan Rice, the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told U.S. senators during her confirmation hearing that the situation in Somalia \"has the potential to pose a serious and direct threat to our own national security.\" But she also expressed skepticism about the wisdom of sending in a U.N. peacekeeping mission to replace an existing African Union force, calling instead for more efforts by Somalia's neighbors and the international community to promote national reconciliation. J. Anthony Holmes, director of the Africa program for the Council on Foreign Relations, said there is \"little appetite on the ground for sustained engagement\" in Somalia. But because of its clan-based society, it is unlikely the country would emerge as \"a breeding ground for terrorism,\" he said. Holmes said U.S. policy should focus more on longer-term issues -- such as addressing humanitarian and economic issues in the impoverished Horn of Africa country, where years of civil war and near-anarchy have left 1 million people displaced and 3 million needing food aid. The U.S. intervention in Somalia in the 1990s, in which Somali militiamen killed 18 American service members during a failed attempt to capture a Mogadishu warlord, had a chilling effect on U.S. policy toward Africa. Author and policy-maker Jared Cohen writes in his book, \"One Hundred Days of Silence: America and the Rwanda Genocide\" that the \"catastrophe in Somalia was the catalyst for this unspoken decision not to intervene in places like Rwanda.\" As the new Obama administration gets its Africa policy in place, Washington is in a good position to exert some leverage in Somalia, Prendergast said. Previous U.S. counterterrorism efforts worked \"at cross-purposes\" with efforts to promote long-term stability and provide humanitarian aid, according to Menkhaus. He recommended that Somali leaders be given room to either marginalize or co-opt the opposition on their own. \"I personally think that they will, if left to their own devices,\" Menkhaus said. \"But Somalis are never left to their own devices.\" CNN's David McKenzie and Matt Smith contributed to this report.", "fda3227662b9f67900f063790d7190d45c1803ad": "(CNN) -- The Continental Airlines plane that crashed in Clarence Center, New York, late Thursday is one of several major incidents over the past two months.

Esther Reed, who allegedly used a missing woman's ID to get into colleges, was arrested by U.S. Marshals. A fugitive for more than a year, Esther Reed was arrested Saturday by U.S. Marshals in suburban Chicago, said Clark Brazier, a spokesman for the police department in Traveler's Rest, South Carolina. Reed is scheduled to have a bond hearing this week in Illinois. South Carolina authorities are seeking to extradite her on charges of aggravated identity theft and wire fraud. Reed assumed the identity of Brooke Henson, who was 20 years old when she disappeared more than eight years ago from Travelers Rest, investigators say. It's unclear how Reed obtained Henson's personal information, but Reed used Henson's identity to take the SAT and GED, and then applied to the schools, said Jon Campbell, a Travelers Rest Police Department investigator who spoke to CNN last year. Officials at Harvard University and Columbia University have acknowledged that a Brooke Henson was enrolled at their schools, but said privacy laws prevent them from discussing details. \"There's a little relief that goes with [the news of Reed's arrest],\" Brooke's aunt Lisa Henson told CNN Sunday. \"But [Brooke] is still missing. I'd like to have some answers. I would love to see [Reed] and look her in the eye and say, 'You're a horrible person.' \" Police say they're confident Reed was not involved in Henson's disappearance. Authorities believe Henson was killed by someone who knew her. However, no body has been found and no arrests have been made. Henson's family had heard nothing about their missing relative for years until the summer of 2006, when New York City authorities told police in Travelers Rest that they had found her, alive and well, in Manhattan. The police relayed that message to Henson's family. \"I was jumping for joy,\" said Lisa Henson. \"It was incredible.\" But the family's joy was short-lived when it was revealed that the woman found was actually Reed. An ex-boyfriend told CNN that Reed -- posing as Henson -- often bragged about being a world-class chess player who earned a living playing the game competitively. The man told CNN that he believed her until he challenged her to a game and beat her. Originally from the tiny town of Townsend, Montana, Reed had been reported missing by her family in 1999, around the same time that Henson disappeared. In high school in Montana, Reed earned poor grades. \"Esther was the kind of kid who would have been invisible,\" her English teacher James Therriault said. \"If you didn't take pains to notice her presence.\" E-mail to a friend .

Ryanne Mace was 19 when she was killed last year in a shooting rampage at Northern Illinois University. \"I'd like you to sit in the front row of every class that you're in and constantly drag information out of these people, and if you don't understand what they're talking about, raise your hand and say, 'I don't get it' until you get it,\" Mace recalled telling her. His daughter, 19-year-old Ryanne, took that advice. Now, he wishes she would have sat somewhere else. Mace believes that Ryanne was probably one of the first to be killed in the Northern Illinois University shootings a year ago, because she was in the front row in the lecture at Cole Hall. \"She was, from what I understand, in the front row of that room and was probably the first one that had shots fired at her after the gentleman that was on stage,\" Mace said. \"It's not an easy thing to carry, but I shouldn't have to carry it, either.\" Ryanne was Eric and Mary Kay Mace's only child. She was one of five NIU students killed on Valentine's Day last year by Steven Kazmierczak, a former NIU student who was attending graduate school at the University of Illinois in Champaign. \"It's difficult. There's always an ache, loneliness and a longing. We're going to miss her every day for the rest of our lives,\" Mary Kay Mace said. Her husband added, \"I go to bed thinking about her. I wake up in the morning thinking about her. Any time that I've a free moment, it will pop up.\" The Maces said they would like to know more about the police investigation into the shooting and Kazmierczak's history of mental illness. Police records provided to CNN indicate that he had a long history of mental problems, including several suicide attempts. The parents also are angry that he was able to buy guns. Because Kazmierczak had not been in a mental facility for more than five years, he was legally able to purchase those weapons in Illinois -- and on the firearms application form Kazmierczak filled out, he stated that he had never been adjudicated \"mentally defective\" and had never been \"committed to a mental institution.\"  See some of Kazmierczak's mental health records \u00bb . \"I don't know if they don't report it if he's a juvenile with the mental illness on his record or what.

That is what makes me angry.\" Now, the Maces have started a scholarship foundation for psychology majors in honor of their daughter. And they hope that what happened a year ago is never forgotten. \"I don't want them to forget a single detail about it, because the details aren't going to change just by forgetting about them,\" Eric Mace said.", "585ac8d43bb92ff9c336d556458a1eb56e6917d7": "CLARENCE CENTER, New York (CNN) -- President Obama on Friday praised Beverly Eckert, the widow of a September 11 victim and a prominent post-9/11 activist, who was one of the passengers who died in a plane crash outside Buffalo, New York. Sean Rooney and wife Beverly Eckert in an undated photograph. \"Beverly lost her husband on 9/11,\" Obama said, \"and became a tireless advocate for the families whose lives were forever changed on that September day.\" A resident of Stamford, Connecticut, Eckert was the widow of Buffalo native Sean Rooney, who died at the World Trade Center. Obama's words underscored the shock and grief from friends, family and acquaintances over the news that Eckert was aboard the Continental Connection Flight 3407. The turboprop plane crashed Thursday, killing all 49 aboard and one person on the ground. \"Tragic events such as these remind us of the fragility of life and the value of every single day. And one person who understood that well was Beverly Eckert, who was on that flight and who I met with just a few days ago,\" Obama said in brief remarks. Obama met Eckert at a gathering of September 11 victims' families on Friday. Valerie Lucznikowska, a member of September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, said she, Eckert and another woman traveled to Washington for the meeting. Lucznikowska said Eckert asked Obama whether the group would have ongoing meetings with his administration. Obama said there would be, even though they wouldn't necessarily be with him. After the 2001 terrorist attacks, Eckert co-founded Voices of September 11, an advocate group for survivors and families. Eckert had a reputation as a strong campaigner of September 11 families, involved in protests leading to more land for a ground zero memorial, working on the September 11 Commission's Family Steering Committee and pushing for a victims' families compensation fund. She was traveling to Buffalo for a celebration of what would have been her husband's 58th birthday. Eckert planned to take part in presenting a scholarship award at Canisius High School that was established in honor of her late husband, who was an alumnus, according to the school's president, John Knight. Obama mentioned the scholarship plans in his remarks Friday. \"In keeping with that passionate commitment, she was on her way to Buffalo to mark what would have been her husband's birthday and launch a scholarship in his memory. She was an inspiration to me and to so many others, and I pray that her family finds peace and comfort in the hard days ahead,\" Obama said. Lucznikowska, whose nephew died in the World Trade Center attacks, said she was \"horribly saddened by this news.\" \"I would very much like to honor her. She was truly a wonderful person. She was someone who was trying to make society better.\" Eckert backed Peaceful Tomorrows' effort to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and end the military commissions there, Lucznikowska said. The group elaborated on this stance in a signed letter to Obama, and Eckert gave a presidential aide a separate letter listing her own concerns, Lucznikowska said. Knight said Canisius High postponed the scholarship presentation, set to occur at noon Friday, for two students entering the high school next fall. He said Eckert also had been active in a capital campaign fundraising effort. \"She struck me as a wonderful, beautiful person who clearly wanted to do something to remember her husband in a way that would have an everlasting impact on our community,\" Knight said. Gordon Felt, president of the Families of Flight 93 Inc., the plane that crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on September 11, also expressed his grief. \"We note with deep sorrow the passing of Beverly Eckert in the Buffalo plane crash.

Peter W. Kunhardt, left, Philip B. Kunhardt III and Peter W. Kunhardt Jr. co-authored \"Looking for Lincoln.\" In fact, eminent Lincoln historian Harold Holzer said there's only one other family that's contributed more \"to our understanding of America's most enduring leader,\" and that's the Lincolns themselves. \"The Kunhardts -- and before them, their ancestor Frederick Hill Meserve -- have been active, and crucial for generations, in preserving Lincoln's image for posterity,\" Holzer said. \"Mr. Meserve literally saved photos from destruction, then cataloged and analyzed them. Later members of the family wrote seminal books incorporating the family-owned archive into the stories of Lincoln's life and death.\" The family collection was the basis for the new book, \"Looking for Lincoln\" (Knopf), and for a PBS documentary. One of the book's co-authors, 26-year-old Peter W. Kunhardt Jr., has now joined the family business as assistant director of the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation. Kunhardt, who recently earned a master's degree in art business and photography, also works on the Gordon Parks Foundation, a division of the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation, which includes the life's work of the pioneering African-American photographer. Kunhardt spoke with CNN in an interview and follow-up conversations about the extraordinary family history. CNN: Tell us about your family. Peter W. Kunhardt Jr: I'm the fifth generation to be working on Lincoln. My great-great-grandfather was a man by the name of Frederick Hill Meserve. His father, William Neal Meserve, was a soldier in the Civil War who was wounded at the battle of Antietam, and he kept a diary of the entire time he was in war. That diary was illustrated by his son, Frederick Hill Meserve, years after the war through collecting photography. He became one of the leading collectors of 19th-century American photography. ... At that time photography was still quite new. In the late 19th century, the war-weary nation lost its interest in the images of that era. Many glass negatives were thought to be worthless. The emulsion was washed off, and many were used to build greenhouses. Meserve wrote a book in 1911 called \"Photographs of Abraham Lincoln.\" He became obsessed with Lincoln. Lincoln was the first president to be photographed while in office. Meserve's goal in life was to find and catalog all the existing images of Lincoln, of which we now know there were about 120. Each photograph in Meserve's book, which he updated for the next half century, was given an \"M\" number. Part of our work was to update his numbering system and establish a new national standard. Then his daughter Dorothy Meserve Kunhardt, she became heavily involved with Lincoln scholarship and the collection as well. She was the author of the children's book, \"Pat the Bunny,\" which ... as everyone knows today, it's one of the most popular children's books. She worked with her father on Lincoln publications and continued to collect Lincoln. The collection was passed to Philip Kunhardt Jr., my grandfather, who eventually passed this collection of photographs on to my father and uncle, who were my co-authors in this book, \"Looking for Lincoln.\" My grandfather, father and uncle wrote a book on Lincoln in 1992 called \"Lincoln: An Illustrated Biography,\" using the contents of the collection. Each generation has continued the fascination with the collection but with a special interest in Abraham Lincoln. CNN: What's your involvement now in the collection? Kunhardt: My role is the assistant director of the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation. The foundation was established in 2002 by my father and uncle in order to preserve our family's collection and make it available to the public. During the past century, the collection had grown so large that we decided it was finally time to place it in public hands. That is why we first formed the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation. And this year the collection will be moved to the Neuberger Museum of Art at the State University of New York in Purchase, New York, and the Purchase Library at SUNY, where it will be made available to students and scholars. CNN: Was there ever any doubt in your mind that you wanted to go into this field? Kunhardt: I was an art history major at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. I've always been fascinated with our collection. I was flattered to be asked to help with this project, the Lincoln book. I've been an intern since I was about in fifth grade. I've grown up knowing this collection very well, putting everything in plastic sleeves. Then when we found out that they weren't of archival quality, I had to change them to polyester sleeves. It's really been a family love. We've all grown up with this collection. A great portion of this collection is now housed at the National Portrait Gallery. It was sold after my great-grandmother's death. CNN: What are some of the most valuable parts of the collection? Kunhardt: It includes many gems, like Alexander Gardner's oversized portrait of Lincoln that was taken just before he went to Gettysburg. As a young boy, I remember it hanging on the walls of our home. We also own the bronze life mask of Lincoln cast by Leonard Volk. CNN: Was Lincoln particularly interested in being photographed? Kunhardt: It was his way of reaching out to a wider audience. It was a process that was so slow, he had to sit for long periods of time with a neck brace in order to be photographed because the exposure time was forever. There are pictures where if he moved just slightly, the picture was blurry. Crowd scenes are always blurry because you couldn't make the crowd stay still. CNN: What's the story of the Gordon Parks Foundation? Kunhardt: My grandfather Philip Kunhardt was managing editor of Life magazine. He and Gordon became close personal friends, and shortly before both of them died in 2006, my grandfather showed Gordon how we were preserving our 19th-century collection. After Gordon's death, his estate placed all of his photographs with us, and we formed the Gordon Parks Foundation. CNN: What else are you working on? Kunhardt: Our next book is \"Lincoln Life Size,\" which will be published in September 2009. We're taking the Lincoln photographs and blowing them up to the actual size of Lincoln's face ... and it will include his own reactions to some of the photographs.", "02aef53a8ae894b86d408fa90194ceaa1332ba5b": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy arrested nine more suspected pirates off the coast of Somalia Thursday -- the second capture in two days -- after receiving a distress call from an Indian-flagged commercial ship. Suspected pirates are arrested in the Gulf of Aden. According to the Navy announcement, at 4 a.m. local time the Indian-flagged Premdivya sent a distress call to all ships in the area reporting that she had been fired upon by a small skiff, and suspected pirates were attempting to board it. A U.S. Navy helicopter crew was launched from the USS Vella Gulf and fired two warning shots at the small boat to get them to stop. A Navy boarding team was then launched to investigate the skiff's crew and found rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons on board the small craft, according to Navy officials. The suspected pirates were taken aboard the USS Vella Gulf and processed. They'll be moved to a temporary holding facility aboard the larger USNS Lewis and Clark, according to the statement. The Navy is now holding a total of 16 suspected pirates while the U.S. and Kenyan governments work out legal details on how the suspects will be moved to Kenya for prosecution. Last month, the United States and Kenya signed an agreement saying that suspected pirates captured by U.S. ships will be moved to Kenya to be tried for their crimes. The capture Wednesday of seven suspected pirates marks the first time the United States was able to capture and hold pirates since its forces began patrolling the dangerous waters off Somalia. Piracy has become a chronic problem off the Horn of Africa in recent years, with some pirates operating from largely lawless Somalia. Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.

CNN's Ali Velshi says the Fed needs access to large amounts of cash to keep Wall Street confident. The Fed announced Tuesday it would authorize the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend up to $85 billion over two years to insurance giant American International Group. In return, the government will receive a 79.9 percent stake in the company, which has 74 million clients in 130 countries. The first Treasury auction for the central bank will be for $40 million. The Treasury bills will mature in 35 days, allowing the Fed access to quick cash. But what does this mean to American taxpayers and an ailing U.S. economy? CNN senior business correspondent Ali Velshi breaks it down. Q: What does this mean in layman's terms? A: The Federal Reserve keeps a lot of money in supply to help banks, and basically, when they help them, it means they loan them money. As this credit crisis intensified, the Fed invited more and more banks to come and borrow from it and would accept collateral that was not as high-quality as it would typically accept. The Fed was the lender of last resort for a bank; you paid a premium to borrow money from the Fed, and you had to give them your best collateral. What's happening now is you still pay a premium, but you can go with lower collateral. The thinking behind that is the more banks feel free to go to the Fed to borrow money, the less likely they are to get money at higher interest from other sources and the less likely they are to fail as a result. In other words, if they feel that there is an ability to borrow money from the Fed -- if they absolutely have to to stay afloat -- that facility is there. Well, the number of banks that have taken advantage of this has caused the reserve at the Federal Reserve to go from about $800 billion to, by some estimates, as low as $200 billion. And when they do things like the bailout of AIG, that's where that money comes from.  Watch experts discuss what the bailout means for consumers \u00bb . So you do the math, and there's some sense that the Fed could run out of money to finance these banks, to give loans. And just the idea that the Fed could run out of that money causes Wall Street to panic because it says, \"If four more banks were to fail, the Fed wouldn't have money to bail them out, so we're in a bad situation.\" So the thinking is: Let's increase the Federal Reserve's reserve, and that's what this auction is. It's the first in a series of auctions -- this one will be for $40 billion -- where the Treasury on behalf of the Federal Reserve issues bonds that they will sell at auction, the way they normally do, and they'll be for 35-day periods. So the Fed gives out those bonds, and in exchange, gets cash and the Fed sits on that cash and uses it for whatever it needs. Q: Why would the government bail out a company like AIG but let Lehman Brothers file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection? A: Speaking frankly, the world can do without another investment firm. If an investment bank fails, any remaining investment bank can hire more people and take their jobs. AIG is not an investment bank. As a principal insurer, it insures consumers, it insures businesses and it insures business ventures, so it's not just that your corner store needs insurance. AIG insures things like rigs and Hollywood movies and those subprime mortgage-backed securities. The utter failure of business that would ensue from a failure of AIG would be catastrophic and would actually leave the government having to pick up a few things along the way. The best analogy I've been able to come up with is to use an automaker. When you think about putting an automaker out of business, you put tire makers out of business, you put seat makers out of business, you put all sorts of things out of business. It's the same thing with AIG. There are tentacles. They're just so connected to so many other parts of the economy that the government deemed it more dangerous and potentially more expensive to the economy to have it fail than to give them this loan. Q: What does this mean to the American taxpayer? A: If AIG gets the financing it needs, the taxpayer is actually doing OK. The government is charging such high interest to AIG, and they've got a guarantee of 80 percent of the company, so this may not be a bad deal for the government, and the interest is high enough to discourage others from coming cap in hand to the government. If you realize that maybe the government will bail you out as a last resort but you're going to pay 12 percent interest on the loan, that's expensive. For a business to be paying 12 percent for their money is very expensive. Q: What sort of interest can an investor expect from something like this? A: When the Federal Reserve loans money out to banks, these are short loans. They've typically been under a month. They can be extended under new emergency rules, but typically speaking, they're all supposed to be \"bridge loans,\" immediate financing while some sort of problem is sorted out. The loan to AIG is a 24-month bridge loan, so obviously these 35-day bonds are not great, but the idea is that money that is borrowed by the Federal Reserve in exchange for a bill is as safe as it gets. That is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The government can borrow money probably for less than most people can because this gets sold to investors who want safety. It's not a premium. The government's not going to pay a lot of interest on this, but it's a very safe loan. If you're an investor who's looking for a small but absolutely safe return for 35 days, this might be an option for you. Q: These bonds are not available to the individual investor? A: Not at all. It's not something that individuals buy. It's all done commercially. Q: The U.S. government says it will charge AIG roughly 12 percent interest for this rescue loan, but that's not comparable to what an investor would earn by buying these bonds? A: Not at all. I don't know what the rate is and that' s because it's an auction -- it's determined that way. I would be surprised if there's any material spread between that and an equivalent Treasury. If you buy a Treasury, it trades on a daily basis. I'm guessing this is actually more of a straight bond in that you'll buy it and that'll be your rate until you redeem it, but I could be wrong. I don't know the machination of that. It's a safe, safe, safe investment. It's the United States government backing the investment. Q: And by being a safe investment, it dictates a lower return? A: Correct. Q: So the fact that the Fed, by some estimates, is low on cash and having to bail out a weak economy, that doesn't negatively affect the government's bond rating? A: It doesn't have an effect on the rating. The way things happen at these auctions sometimes is that regardless of the good rating, sometimes they're oversubscribed and sometimes they're undersubscribed. It has more to do with the needs of the market. If the market needs the money, they'll sell quickly. It's not the equivalent of printing new money; it's borrowing more money. The government is simply issuing a loan based on its own credit. Q: Is the Treasury auction then a result of the weak economy or is it directly linked to the AIG rescue loan? A: It's directly linked to the moves that the Federal Reserve has taken to shore up financial services, and AIG would be key among those. Q: The government has said the rescue loan is backed by AIG's considerable assets, which total about $1.1 trillion. If reports are correct that the government is planning on selling off many of these assets to get its money back, why does it need to issue these bonds? A: Two separate issues. Regarding AIG, the government gets 80 percent of the assets as collateral. They're not free to sell them. The company has to sell them, and as they do so and repay the government, the 80 percent hold can be diminished. You may not need any of that to cover AIG. The bond issuance here has got more to do with the fact that the reserves that the Fed keeps have dwindled from about $800 billion to an estimate -- and I should tell you that's an outside estimate, not the Fed's estimate -- of about $200 billion, so they are just looking for methodology to increase the reserve. I don't think it's meant to say that the Fed is losing $85 billion of its $200 billion, and that $85 billion is covered. It's a separate transaction. It's the idea that we need to have enough money to keep Wall Street confident that we can move in and rescue a bank if we have to.", "8206e93e1cd8b63fd8efe25bbf7ac1bd95970734": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- His life has never been easy. Born into poverty and war, his ears and tail were chopped off when he was just a few months old in preparation for dog-fighting. He escaped to find a better life, only to be trapped in lonely, sterile quarantine for six months. Bear plays for the first time out of quarantine after coming to Britain from Afghanistan. But all that changed Monday when Bear the dog stepped out of British quarantine and through the doors of a London animal shelter. \"He's absolutely a loving dog,\" said former British Royal Marine Paul \"Penny\" Farthing, who helped bring Bear to England. \"He just loves people. It's a good thing he was brought back to the U.K. when he was quite young, so he's never gone through having to fend for himself in the street and be made to dogfight.\" An unknown soldier in Afghanistan first found Bear last year and brought him to a local Afghan animal shelter. The shelter wasn't able to care for Bear, so it contacted Farthing, who now runs a charity for stray and abandoned animals, primarily dogs from Afghanistan. Farthing's Nowzad Dogs is named for the Afghan town where he was based for a few months in 2006. He asked Mayhew International, an arm of London's Mayhew Animal Home, to help find Bear a new home. Mayhew International says Bear is one of the few dogs it has brought back to Britain. Usually it tries to find animals new homes within their own countries. \"Although Mayhew International does not encourage people to bring dogs to the U.K. from abroad as a general policy, we made an exception in this case as it was the perfect opportunity to highlight the plight of thousands of stray animals in Afghanistan,\" the organization said in a statement. Bear's story may be unique, but he is certainly not alone. Mayhew International, which works around the world to educate people about animal welfare, says there are countless dogs in Afghanistan that are homeless or trapped in a life of dogfighting -- an increasingly popular pastime in Afghanistan. \"Animal welfare is not looked so highly upon in Afghanistan,\" said Christopher Sainsbury, Mayhew's international projects officer. \"In war-torn areas, people tend to forget the animal welfare side of things. [We want to] make people aware that this is a key side of things that needs to be assessed, needs to be worked on.\" Bear is a Koochi dog, a large breed common in Afghanistan, according to Dr. Mohammadzai Abduljalil, a Mayhew veterinarian from Afghanistan. While no one knows Bear's exact age, Abduljalil said they believe he is just about a year old. You wouldn't know it by Bear's size. He's already a large dog nearly 3 feet high with large paws to match. Stepping into the Mayhew play area Monday for the first time, Bear made sure to sniff every corner of the room and mark his territory a few times before settling in to play. He had a puppy's curiosity and quickly started playing fetch and tug-of-war with Farthing, wagging enthusiastically the small part of his tail which is left. Bear is lucky. He escaped a violent and uncertain future in Afghanistan.  Not so for many other dogs left behind. It is those dogs that Farthing hopes to help with his charity. \"They need someone to look after them, so why not me?\" Farthing said. It began when the Royal Marines arrived in the war-torn town of Now Zad, in Afghanistan's Helmand province, in October 2006. They found stray dogs wandering the streets, scavenging for food, dodging bullets and seeking shelter from the hot days and cold nights. Many were also being used for dogfighting, with their ears and tails docked to make the fights last longer and give their opponents less to bite. Farthing and other Marines began to feed and care for a few dogs that wandered into their camp. At first they had three dogs, but other strays soon figured out the camp was a source of food and shelter, and before long the Marines found themselves caring for seven dogs and 14 puppies. Time was running out, however. The Marines were due to leave Now Zad in February 2007 and knew they couldn't take the dogs with them. They looked for some way to make sure the dogs would be taken care of after they left. That's when Farthing first contacted Mayhew International. They put him in touch with a small shelter in northern Afghanistan that Mayhew had assisted since its inception, providing advice and veterinary support. The shelter offered to take the dogs on one condition: The Marines had to arrange for the dogs' transfer to Kabul, a difficult and dangerous three days' drive away. Finding a taxi willing to accept dogs was the first hurdle; the second was that the drivers refused to allow the dogs to be transported in Western-style cages, which would give away to the Taliban that the car was carrying foreigners. Instead, the dogs had to be tied with ropes, the Afghan way, and the puppies had to be stashed in small crates -- in this case, a bird cage. \"A lot was done on trust,\" Farthing told CNN. \"The Afghans did it as a favor to us. We paid for some of their fuel and their costs, but it was fantastic. It was them helping us out. They didn't have to do it. It shows that the people of Afghanistan and us, we can work together.\" In the end, most of the dogs made it to Kabul, but not without casualties. Two were left behind for lack of room in the taxi, and two more escaped along the way when a car door was accidentally left open. Three of the largest puppies were stolen, probably for dog fighting. Three dogs and eleven puppies finally made it to the shelter, but nine of the puppies later died due to an outbreak of disease and shortage of vaccines. Sainsbury, of Mayhew International, says the story of the Now Zad dogs and of Bear shows their efforts can help animals, even if it's just one at a time. Mayhew International works with organizations already established in developing countries to plan mass sterilization drives that reduce the number of unwanted animals. They also train veterinary surgeons in modern neutering techniques that are quick and humane. \"The way that war makes looking after animal welfare harder is quite clear,\" Sainsbury said. \"Animal welfare gets forgotten and it becomes a back-burner because organizations ... that were working in those war-torn countries will probably be unable to operate any longer. They'll be unable to aid the populations of stray and community animals which would rely on their help originally.\" Mayhew CEO Caroline Yates said staff have no idea how long it will take for Bear to find a new home. They hope the publicity surrounding his arrival in Britain will encourage people to think about adopting him. Yates said they hope to have him adopted within a month. Said Farthing, \"To be able to help just one [dog] is a reward in itself and a huge step to highlighting the undocumented suffering that animals in all war zones are subjected to.\"", "15b8d972fa1a9192dfb6049a5737a592e403aceb": "MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- The Russian Orthodox Church enthroned a new leader Sunday at Moscow's spectacular Christ the Savior Cathedral in a ceremony attended by Russian leaders and Christian delegations from around the world. Patriach Kirill is the first new leader of the Russian Orthodox Church since the collapse of communism. Patriarch Kirill, 62, becomes first new leader of the church since the fall of communism, and the first enthroned in the Cathedral since it was rebuilt at the end of the 1990s. Russian first lady Svetlana Medvedeva was the first person to receive the Eucharist from the new Patriarch, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. Russian Orthodox Church leaders chose Kirill Tuesday to replace Patriarch Alexy II, who died in December. Kirill, who became acting head of the church after Alexy died, is seen as a modernizer. He chaired the church's department for external relations starting in 1989. Kirill becomes the 16th Patriarch since the position was created in 1589. The appointment is for life. He met Pope Benedict XVI recently, one of the highest-level meetings between Roman Catholic and Orthodox leaders since the two churches split more than 1,000 years ago. The late Pope John Paul II was repeatedly denied permission to visit Russia. Kirill said before he was elected Tuesday that the Russian Orthodox Church should work with other Christian faiths to support \"those partners who are ready to oppose, together with us, the marginalization of religion, to speak out for believers' rights and to build one's life according to one's own principles, to defend the underlying meaning of morality in the life of an individual and society.\" Alexy, 79, died December 5 after 18 years at the head of the church.

Shoppers sort through counterfeit brand name luxury bags and wallets on a Hong Kong street. \"This was a sophisticated criminal conspiracy that trafficked millions of dollars of counterfeit goods from China, profiting off the backs of legitimate companies and their hard-working employees,\" said Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher. Authorities call it one of the largest counterfeit operations ever discovered, involving about 300,000 bags and wallets with names like Burberry, Gucci and Coach. For customers who bought the knockoffs, it seemed like a deal. They paid a total of about $16 million for what would have been more than $100 million in handbags, purses and wallets in legitimate retail sales. The alleged leaders of the counterfeit operations are three Chinese citizens living in New York. Chong Lam, 49, and Joyce Chan, 39, were arrested there Wednesday. Eric Yuen, 39, was arrested Thursday in Las Vegas, Nevada. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who made the arrests began investigating the alleged scheme five years ago, after raids turned up counterfeit goods. The indictment was secretly returned in Richmond, Virginia, in October. The charges were unsealed when the alleged conspirators were taken into custody. Authorities seized and froze 29 bank accounts and three New York properties. The Chinese defendants will be taken to Richmond, where they will be arraigned at a later date, officials said.

The Pentagon considered delaying the release of detainees from Guantanamo Bay because of criticism. Pentagon documents discuss CIA and Pentagon detention activities earlier this decade and indicate coordination between agencies in hiding internees from the Red Cross. Amnesty International USA, New York University's Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, and the Center for Constitutional Rights obtained the material through a Freedom of Information Act request and released it Thursday. \"It's obvious that Defense officials engaged in legal gymnastics to find ways to keep detainees off the books,\" said Meg Satterthwaite, faculty director of the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice. \"A full accounting of all agencies' responsibilities must now take place to ensure that these abuses don't continue under a different guise.\" President Obama has signed an order closing the Guantanamo detention facility in Cuba and prohibiting CIA prisons. However, the order allows the CIA to detain people temporarily. It is not known whether the Pentagon or the CIA still holds \"ghost detainees,\" Satterthwaite said, referring to people housed at secret facilities. The Pentagon issued an information paper May 28, 2004, on the \"applicability of the Geneva Conventions to 'Ghost Detainees' in Iraq.\" Its purpose was to clarify the law about such detainees. The Geneva Conventions spell out international humanitarian law and authorize the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisoners during armed conflicts. The Pentagon's information paper said that if \"absolute military security\" requires it, the conventions permit the holding of persons \"who participated in activities hostile to the security of the occupying power.\" Specific examples would be \"spies and saboteurs,\" the paper said. Although the Red Cross must be notified of such detentions, \"persons who have committed such acts are considered to have forfeited the rights of communication,\" the paper said. \"Normally the ICRC has the right to go to all places where protected people are detained,\" the paper said. But, it added, such visits can be denied temporarily \"for reasons of imperative military necessity.\" A February 17, 2006, e-mail showed that a State Department foreign policy adviser urged the Pentagon to consider delaying by a month and a half the release of Guantanamo prisoners who were scheduled to be sent home in order to avoid bad press. This came amid worldwide furor over the Guantanamo detention facility, photos of prisoners being mistreated at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, and sharp criticism on the streets and in blogs toward U.S. detention policies. \"We may need to definitely think about checking with SouthCom to see if we can hold off on return flights for 45 days or so until things die down,\" the adviser wrote to Gen. Norton Schwartz, then head of the U.S. Transportation Command. \"Otherwise we are likely to have hero's welcomes awaiting the detainees when they arrive, and we will have problems getting overflight and landing clearance for the flights anyway. It would probably be preferable if we could deliver these detainees in something smaller and more discreet than a T tail\" -- apparently referring to a large transport plane like the giant C-5 Galaxy. SouthCom is the U.S. Southern Command, the American military command covering Latin American and the Caribbean. Schwartz is now the Air Force chief of staff. The letter appeared to be an e-mail reply to a State Department \"hot issues\" memo that said the United States was getting \"creamed on human rights\" and \"taking a big hit on the issues of human rights and respect for the rule of law.\" It pointed to news stories about a U.N. Guantanamo report and coverage highlighting calls from officials to close Guantanamo. It cited criticism of the United States in blogs and discussion boards. \"America has lost its prestige,\" a blogger from Yemen wrote. \"Every year the world waits for the annual U.S. State Department report on human rights. Today, it is America that awaits the world's opinion of its human rights policy. From Gitmo, to Abu Ghraib, to secret prisons in Europe, the world accuses America of not respecting human rights.\" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Thursday that he had not seen the documents and wasn't aware of the story. He did elaborate on the factors taken into account when transferring detainees from the Guantanamo facility. \"It has to do with their threat,\" Whitman said. \"It has to do with ... whether or not we think they have information that is important to our intelligence efforts. \"And there are also considerations given to ensure that the [transferred detainees] will be treated appropriately and that in cases where continued detention is necessary, that the appropriate conditions are met for that, too. \"It has been U.S. policy not to return detainees if we thought they would be mistreated by their country of origin,\" he said.", "2dd03905dc81d75ead7eb410043041a7d619729d": "(CNN) -- The biggest surprise on a busy night of international football on Wednesday came in Duesseldorf, where Euro 2008 finalists Germany were beaten by Norway for the first time in 73 years. Norway players celebrate Christian Grindheim's (No.16) goal in their shock victory over Germany. Midfielder Christian Grindheim scored from close-range, from Morten Gamst Pedersen's cross, in the 63rd minute to give the visitors a 1-0 victory to stun the 45,000 home supporters on a freezing evening. Not since the 1936 Olympics in Berlin had Germany lost to Norway --the defeat even more suprising as Germany coach Joachim Loew had the luxury of naming a full-strength side, while new Norway coach Egil Olsen was missing seven key players. In Marseille, Lionel Messi scored a brilliant solo goal to give Argentina a 2-0 win over France and give Diego Maradona a second straight win as national coach. The Barcelona striker collected the ball outside the penalty area and ran right through the home defense before expertly slotting the ball past goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. Newcastle winger Jonas Gutierrez had opened the scoring four minutes before the interval with a shot that went inside Mandanda's left-hand post. Meanwhile, Jamel Saihi scored a second-half equalizer to give home side Tunisia a 1-1 draw with the Netherlands in Rades. Montpellier star Saihi netted midway through the second-half with a long-range shot that Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg should have saved.

Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. The plane's final 800-foot fall took five seconds, Steve Chealander of the National Transportation Safety Board said. The aircraft crashed into a home in Clarence Center, New York, near Buffalo, on Thursday night, killing all 49 people aboard. A 61-year-old man in the house died also, but his wife and daughter survived. Final motions of the aircraft were so drastic that the plane's autopilot automatically disengaged and warnings sounded, Chealander said, citing information from the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders. Also, a \"stick-shaker\" device, which noisily vibrates an airplane's controls to warn the pilot of imminent stall, kicked in, he said. The flight crew of Continental Connection Flight 3407, operated by Colgan Air, discussed \"significant\" ice buildup on the aircraft's windshield and wings before the crash, and icing has become a focus as a possible cause.  Follow the plane's path \u00bb . Chealander said the plane's de-icing system was turned on 11 minutes after the flight left Newark, New Jersey, for Buffalo, and remained on for the entire flight. He said the pilots were told before departure from Newark that there was \"light to moderate icing\" in the Buffalo area but that no other pilots had reported problems with their landings at the Buffalo airport. \"It was really not a bad-weather day, and they chose to launch [from Newark],\" Chealander said of the pilot and the first officer. The plane was on autopilot during its approach to the Buffalo airport, Chealander said. As to questions about whether the autopilot should have been turned off, Chealander said using it even in bad weather situations \"is normal.\"  Watch Chealander discuss autopilot options \u00bb . \"You're encouraged to use the autopilot to help you with the workloads of these high intense weather situations that we fly into all the time,\" he said. He said the NTSB in the past has recommended to the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees civil aviation including commercial airlines, that in severe icing conditions, \"it might be best to disconnect autopilot so that the pilot might have a better feel\" for the aircraft's conditions. However, severe icing is \"not what we saw here,\" Chealander said, adding that the FAA has no such disengagement rule in effect. \"To say that they should not have been flying on autopilot is not correct,\" Chealander said. The pilots' recorded remarks about \"significant\" icing did not indicate \"severe\" icing, he said. The NTSB has said problems for the 74-seat Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 occurred when the pilots lowered the landing gear and tried to set the wing flaps to slow the aircraft for landing. Offering more details, Chealander said Sunday that the plane's nose pitched up 31 degrees, then down 45 degrees. The aircraft rolled left 46 degrees then right 105 degrees, or past the 90-degree vertical point, he said. Inside the cabin, he said, conditions went from lower than normal gravitational force to twice the normal force as the plane rocked through the sky. iReport.com: Send your photos, videos from the scene . Chealander said the NTSB's investigation of the crash site indicated that the two propellers on the turboprop aircraft were in place when the crash occurred. \"The airplane hadn't lost anything prior to impact. It came down intact,\" he said. Meanwhile, local authorities working to recover remains of the victims said Sunday that a federal team of more than 40 people using some $2.8 million worth of scientific equipment would begin on Monday to help establish positive identification of the victims. But because of the intensity of the crash and a subsequent fire, \"whether we can identify everybody or not remains to be seen,\" Erie County Health Commission Anthony Billittier said. Authorities had recovered 15 bodies as of Saturday night, but Billittier announced Sunday that numbers of recovered bodies will no longer be released \"out of respect for the families.\"", "d80c19f5e27b84db9445500b4fe801826dadbdb7": "BLUE BELL, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Janice McFadden's story hardly stands out. Applications for tuition-free courses have flooded  in at Montgomery County Community College. The Pennsylvania woman was laid off in November after working at the same company for nearly 20 years. Now, as she looks for a job, McFadden worries about losing her home and uprooting her 8-year-old daughter. But when McFadden talks about the future, she has found some cause for hope. In January, the 43-year-old enrolled in the tuition assistance program at Montgomery County Community College in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania. The program offers county residents who have been laid off since September 2008 the opportunity to take 12 college credits -- usually four courses -- for free. McFadden said the program will allow her to reassess her options while she improves her marketability and salary potential. \"I have all of the capabilities, but I don't have that piece of paper, which is a requirement for a lot of jobs,\" said McFadden, who is taking night courses in economics and English composition. \"I never thought that I would go back to school, all this time, and I'm glad I did.\" She is one of more than 1,100 Pennsylvanians taking tuition-free community college courses as they search for a job. Many are concentrating on new job skills, such as computer programming and accounting, to retrofit their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s so they can compete in a turbulent job market. \"The response was incredible,\" said MCCC President Karen Stout. \"The day after we announced the program, our call center lines were clogged up. We had more than 300 calls in the first two or three days, and we had information sessions that had standing-room-only attendance.\" It's a trend echoed at community colleges across the country. George Boggs, president of the American Association of Community Colleges, said he has heard from 75 college presidents reporting double-digit enrollment increases this semester. \"Community colleges are a big part of the solution to this economic downturn,\" Boggs said. \"We are the institutions that are on the ground bringing these individuals into our institutions and preparing them for a new career.\" Boggs pointed to programs in hard-hit industrial manufacturing states, such as Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as being particularly geared toward mid-career students. Many community colleges have cut or frozen tuition for laid-off workers, established scholarship programs or offered financial assistance to pay for textbooks and transportation costs. However, the spike in applications has put a burden on some schools that already are struggling to keep tuition low and upgrade their facilities. \"Many [community colleges] are reporting that it is the highest-ever enrollment that they have had,\" Boggs said. \"And several are reporting a waiting list of students that they can not accommodate. \"It wouldn't surprise me to hear that about a half-million students are being turned away from our community colleges today.\" At MCCC, enrollment is up 10 percent since spring 2008. But the school has been able to place the new students in courses that aren't at capacity. \"We are worried about our bottom line, especially in this economic environment,\" MCCC President Stout said. \"But we do have classes that are scheduled to go that have open seats. So basically, these were empty seats that we're filling with unemployed workers.\" If unemployment continues to rise -- in Pennsylvania the jobless rate is 6.7 percent -- Stout wants to continue offering tuition-free classes. And even once these mid-career students get back on their feet, she's hoping to see them around campus still. \"Our goal is that these students want to come back and be lifelong learners -- that they understand that in today's economy, you have to continue to keep your job skills relevant and up to date,\" Stout said. \"None of us can be complacent about our own learning.\" Her plan may be working. Much to Janice McFadden's surprise, she has discovered she loves being a student. \"I'm looking at it as a wide-open possibility for me. I don't have to stay in the same field that I was in, I can go back to school ... I can be anybody that I want to be now,\" McFadden said. \"I just have to pick what I really like, what I'm good at, and concentrate on that.\"", "1374e965cf091ce058b3db6fe0a2239355684086": "(CNN) -- Why do we watch? Bob Greene says athletes like Lebron James show us the difference between ordinary effort and excellence. The question applies not just to Sunday's NBA All-Star Game, although that is the immediate case in point. The outcome of the game is not important -- few people remember who wins the All-Star Game from year to year. The players, while attempting to win, do it with barely concealed smiles on their faces. All-Star weekend is mostly a class reunion for basketball's elite. But all the games, in all the seasons, in all the big-time sports leagues -- what is the real reason we keep on watching? You might think that we'd finally grow weary of caring, with headlines about Alex Rodriguez and Barry Bonds, with the sports pages often reading like the business pages (contract disputes and stadium bond-issue negotiations and salary arbitration), with police-blotter details sometimes pushing aside the box scores. Why do we watch? The answer may be found in a single sentence written by a man who died at the age of 76 in this still-new year. John Updike, his literary brilliance aside, was prolific almost beyond belief -- he wrote more than 50 books, and hundreds upon hundreds of essays, short stories, articles, poems and works of criticism. All those careful words, year after year, decade after decade. But of all the sentences Updike ever wrote, there is one that I have long encouraged people to carry around with them -- if not literally tucked into their wallets, then somewhere in their heads and in their hearts. In that sentence of Updike's lies the secret to a lot of things -- including the secret that answers: Why do we watch? The sentence appeared in Updike's 1960 nonfiction piece about Ted Williams's last game for the Boston Red Sox. That piece is famous for how Updike explained Williams's refusal to come out of the dugout and acknowledge the cheering, crying fans after his home run in his final at-bat: \"Gods do not answer letters.\" But it is another sentence in the story that explains everything -- not just about sports, but about the lives the rest of us can lead. Referring to Ted Williams, Updike wrote: . \"For me, Williams is the classic ballplayer of the game on a hot August weekday, before a small crowd, when the only thing at stake is the tissue-thin difference between a thing done well and a thing done ill.\" There it is, right there. That tissue-thin difference, when you don't necessarily know anyone is watching -- there is the answer. We all face the choice in our lives every day: to make the extra effort or not, to stay at the desk for the extra fifteen minutes or to go home, to revise the project one more time before handing it in or to settle for something acceptable, if not quite excellent. On fields of play -- baseball diamonds, football fields, a basketball court like the one on which Sunday's All-Star Game will be held -- the tissue-thin difference is there for the world to see. The lights are dazzlingly bright; the television cameras carry the close-ups around the globe. If a player is dogging it, we can tell; if a player is jogging instead of sprinting, it's self-evident; if a player's mind is already at the party that will be held after the final buzzer, we know. Yet once in a while -- we can see it in a player's eyes -- we are rewarded. Once in a while, sometimes when we are least expecting to witness it, it's there: a tiny move, an all-but-imperceptible lunge, an additional thrust, a reach beyond that which should by all reason be reachable. It was true during small and glorious moments in the days when Bob Cousy and Elgin Baylor were on the basketball court; it is true during small and glorious moments today, when Kobe Bryant and LeBron James are on the court. Updike's tissue-thin difference. A thing done well, when the player could have gotten away with a thing done ill. Are the rest of us the same as the players on the court? In most ways, no. We lack their athletic skill, their physical grace, their monetary riches. They hear cheers every working night; we toil in silence. And yet, the one way in which we can be the same, or at least strive to, is in that pursuit of the tissue-thin difference. The thing that makes the best of them different is the thing that offers us, too, the potential to earn that difference -- the effort beyond mere effort, the desire beyond standard-issue desire, the pride so strong that it becomes the definition of pride. Why do we watch? We watch for those moments. They may be fleeting; they may come and go so quickly we're not even certain, for an instant, that we actually saw them. But they're real, and they can be ours. We wait for them.

Populations within conflict zones such as the Democratic Republic of Congo are particularly vulnerable. The Food and Agriculture Organization has issued preliminary estimates classifying 963 million people as undernourished -- an increase of 40 million people over the past year. \"One out of seven people -- about 15 percent -- suffer chronically of not having enough to eat,\" said Mark Smulders, an FAO economist. The hunger report -- titled \"The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008\" -- said the world's financial and economic problems could throw more people into poverty. The number of hungry had been increasing over the years before the rise in food prices, with warfare and political instability continuing to be among the factors causing poverty. The preliminary estimates lack a firm country breakdown, but last year's figures are an accurate measure of where the problems are. About 907 out of 923 million undernourished people in 2007, or 65 percent of the hungry, live in India, China, the war-wracked Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and Ethiopia. Smulders said about 27 percent of the world's hungry live in India and 15 percent in China. The other countries each represent 4 to 5 percent of the world's total. There has been progress in fighting hunger in the Asian nations of Thailand and Vietnam, and in the sub-Saharan African nations of Ghana, Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Mozambique and Malawi, the report said. Food prices have declined from their peak earlier in the year, but they are staying high compared to other years, the agency said. The Food and Agriculture Organization's food price index was 28 percent higher in October than it was two years before. \"Prices of major cereals have fallen by over 50 percent from their peaks earlier in 2008 but they remain high compared to previous years,\" the FAO said.

Democrats accused him of slowing down negotiations, while Republicans said he helped sway some reluctant lawmakers. Although McCain did not mention Obama by name Wednesday, he made what could be seen as a swipe as his opponent. \"This is a moment of great testing.

Of course, there are always some who think first of their own interests, who calculate their own advantage instead of rushing to the aid of their country,\" McCain said. Meanwhile, Obama blamed the current crisis on greed and irresponsibility in Washington and on Wall Street. \"Let me be perfectly clear. The fact that we are in this mess is an outrage. It's an outrage because we did not get here by accident. This was not a normal part of the business cycle. This was not the actions of a few bad apples,\" he said. After their campaign events, McCain and Obama were both returning to Washington to vote on the bailout package. Obama's running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, was also expected to vote on it. The bailout proposal failed in the U.S. House on Monday. The version going to the Senate adds provisions, including raising the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. cap to $250,000 from $100,000 per account, and will be attached to an existing revenue bill that the House also rejected Monday, according to several Democratic leadership aides. McCain and Obama both support raising the FDIC insurance limit as a way of reviving talks on Capitol Hill. The Senate vote is scheduled for after sundown, in observance of the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah. After pointing fingers Monday, Obama and McCain have both tried to strike a more bipartisan tone as they work on selling the financial rescue package to voters and reluctant members of Congress. Democratic sources said that they expect bipartisan support for the bill. Because the tax bill must originate in the House, the Senate is attaching the rescue plan to a bill that deals with renewable-energy tax incentives. This would allow the Senate to vote before the House to approve a bailout bill. As the candidates focused on the economic crisis, former President Clinton, who ran his own 1992 campaign on the now commonly used phrase \"it's the economy, stupid,\" stumped for Obama in Orlando and Fort Pierce, Florida. Clinton urged residents there to get out and vote, and he told voters why he thinks Obama is the better candidate.  Watch what Clinton says about Obama \u00bb . \"He's got a better philosophy; he's got better answers; he's got a better understanding and better advisers on these complex economic matters. He's got a better vice presidential partner,\" Clinton said. He also said he thinks the country needs to get behind the bailout proposal. The rallies marked the first major events Clinton has hosted on Obama's behalf.

What seems to be part of a red cross is seen on a man involved in the rescue in this official image. \"We are in contact with the Colombian authorities to ask for further clarifications as to exactly what happened,\" ICRC Deputy Director of Operations Dominik Stillhart said in a written statement. Video and photographs originally shown to CNN appeared to show one of the hostage rescuers wearing a bib with a red cross on it, and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe admitted July 16 that Colombian military intelligence used a single Red Cross symbol in the rescue mission. The ICRC statement said video aired on Colombian television earlier this week \"reveals that a member of the army team involved was wearing a tabard marked with the Red Cross emblem before the operation had even begun, suggesting intentional misuse.\"  Watch where bib appeared in video \u00bb . \"If authenticated, these images would clearly establish an improper use of the Red Cross emblem, which we deplore,\" Stillhart said. Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos blasted the leaking of the video as \"an act of disloyalty, possibly corruption or even treason,\" although he defended the right of the media to publish the material once it had been leaked. Speaking at a news conference at a military base in San Jose del Guaviare on Tuesday, Santos said the military had launched an investigation into the leak and said that those responsible would be \"severely disciplined.\" Uribe said in July that the man wearing the bib was a member of the Colombian military intelligence team involved in the rescue who panicked and used the emblem to protect himself. \"This officer, upon confessing his mistake to his superiors, said when the (rescue) helicopter was about to land ... he saw so many guerrillas that he went into a state of angst,\" Uribe said. \"He feared for his life and put on the Red Cross bib over his jacket.\" However, a confidential military source who showed CNN the photographs that included the man wearing the bib said they were taken moments before the mission took off. The use of the \"Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal Emblems is governed by the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols.\" \"These emblems may not be used by bodies or persons not entitled to do so under international humanitarian law,\" the ICRC statement said. Uribe said in July that as the constitutional head of the armed forces, he takes full political responsibility for what he described as a slip-up. He said he has apologized to ICRC officials. Previously, the Colombian president and his top generals had categorically denied that international humanitarian symbols were used in the July 2 rescue mission that duped the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels into handing over prized hostages including former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and soldiers.  Learn about some of the freed hostages \u00bb . Such a use of the Red Cross emblem could constitute a \"war crime\" under the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law, according to international legal expert Mark Ellis, executive director of the International Bar Association. Such a move could endanger humanitarian workers in the future, he said. \"If you use the emblem in a deceitful way, generally the conventions say it would be a breach. (Based on the information as explained to me) the way that the images show the Red Cross emblem being used could be distinguished as a war crime,\" he said in an interview with CNN on July 16. \"Complete and total respect for the Red Cross emblem is essential if the ICRC is to be able to bring assistance and protection to the people worst affected by armed conflicts and other situations of violence,\" the ICRC's statement said. \"As a neutral and impartial humanitarian organization, the ICRC depends on the trust of all the parties to the conflict to be able to carry out its humanitarian work.\"", "23ae06eb107634f7969139f3c0696757772d4b68": "LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Love hurts, especially for jilted lovers on Valentine's Day.

Members of Turkey's honor guard carry flag-draped coffins of two soldiers killed in clashes with the PKK. The PKK, or Kurdistan Workers' Party, said it sustained no casualties in the operation. The Turkish military said the air operation was conducted on the PKK's \"hiding positions\" in the Avasin-Basyan area of northern Iraq near the border with Turkey. During the operation, steps were taken to avoid civilian casualties, the Turkish military said.  Watch inside the PKK's hidden camps \u00bb . The military said the operation was carried out Saturday. The PKK's military wing said the military operation began after Friday's clash and lasted for two days. At least 15 Turkish soldiers were killed and 20 wounded in the clashes, Turkish President Abdullah Gul said Saturday. Two others were missing, and the Turkish military said Sunday they were feared dead. The military said 23 PKK members were also killed in the attacks, launched from northern Iraq. In its statement on Sunday, however, the PKK said more than 60 Turkish troops were killed and at least 30 injured. Nine PKK members were killed, the organization said. Turkey's state-run Anatolia news agency said the clashes occurred in Semdinli, a town in Turkey's southeastern province of Hakkari. On Tuesday, the Turkish government is scheduled to vote on whether to extend the authority of the Turkish military to launch attacks on PKK positions in northern Iraq. Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh on Saturday condemned the clashes, calling them a \"terrorist act\" that \"creates a serious threat to the security of the border areas and the joint security of Iraq and Turkey.\" He called on the Turkish government to deal with this \"criminal act wisely and with self restraint.\" \"The Iraqi government expresses its support for the measures the Turkish government will take within Turkish territory to guarantee its [Turkey's] security and stability,\" he said. Saturday night, Iraq's Presidency Council, made up of President Jalal Talabani -- himself a Kurd -- and his two vice-presidents, condemned what it called \"a vicious attack against Turkish troops.\" \"What makes the attack more horrific is the fact that it happened during the days of the Eid al-Fitr holiday, where Muslims should be celebrating, rejoicing and befriending each other ... instead of fighting and bloodshed,\" the council said. It pledged to \"continue its joint efforts with the Turkish side to prevent the recurrence of such attacks and to put an end to the illegal presence of all foreign militants in Iraq.\" The central Iraqi government has labeled the PKK a terrorist organization, banning its activities and shutting its offices in the country two years ago. But the PKK continues to operate in the Qandil Mountains in northern Iraq bordering Turkey and Iran. The separatist faction has been fighting for self-rule in southeastern Turkey. In an interview held last month in the group's mountain hideout, the PKK's military commander, Bahoz Erdal, told CNN's Arwa Damon and Yousif Bassil that the PKK is defending Kurdish rights and attacks only military targets. \"We are ready for a political solution,\" Erdal said, adding that the PKK would lay down its arms if Kurds were guaranteed equal rights within Turkey. But the Turkish government told CNN in response that it does not negotiate with \"terrorists.\" In February, Turkish military ground forces launched a weeklong offensive against the rebels in northern Iraq.", "45d62e9971a1595b0eab883f56f553c958a72a35": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Democrats' top investigator in Congress reacted angrily Friday to a report that the former Blackwater USA employee accused of killing an Iraqi vice presidential guard was hired by another U.S. contractor weeks later. Rep. Henry Waxman says the State Department is covering up \"an epidemic of corruption\" in Iraq. The report comes alongside Rep. Henry Waxman's warning of a \"confrontation\" with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice over how much Americans should be able to learn about corruption in Iraq. In a sharply worded letter,  Waxman demanded Rice turn over a long list of documents related to the contractor, Andrew Moonen. \"Serious questions now exist about whether the State Department may have withheld from the U.S. Defense Department facts about this Blackwater contractor's shooting of the Iraqi guard that should have prevented his hiring to work on another contract in support of the Iraq War,\" wrote Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Moonen is accused of fatally shooting an Iraqi guard and fleeing the scene, according to a Congressional memo describing the investigation report. He was fined, fired and flown home from Iraq, and the company later paid $20,000 in compensation to the victim's family.  Moonen returned to the United States within a few days of the incident, his attorney said, but in February he returned to Kuwait working for Combat Support Associates (CSA), a company spokesman said. CNN reported Thursday night that CSA said it was unaware of the December incident when it hired Moonen, because the State Department and Blackwater kept the incident quiet and out of Moonen's personnel records.  Waxman wrote it is \"hard to reconcile this development\" with previous assertions State Department officials have made in recent days.   Waxman earlier accused Rice and the State Department of a cover-up of what he called \"an epidemic of corruption\" in Iraq in general. He branded the State Department's anti-corruption efforts \"dysfunctional, under-funded and a low priority.\" Waxman further blasted the department for trying to keep secret details of corruption in Iraq, especially relating to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. \"Corruption is increasing in Iraq, and the State Department can't keep us from knowing that -- can't censor that -- just because it might embarrass or hurt our relationship with [al-]Maliki,\" Waxman said at the House committee hearing.  Watch Waxman ask why negative comments must be said behind closed doors \u00bb . Deputy Secretary of State Larry Butler repeatedly refused to answer questions from Waxman about Iraqi corruption but offered full disclosure if his testimony would be kept secret. Asked if he believes the Iraqi government has the political will or the capability to root out corruption, Butler responded, \"Mr. Chairman, questions which go to the broad nature of our bilateral relationship with Iraq are best answered in a classified setting.\" But he was more forthcoming when talking about efforts that al-Maliki has taken to improve matters, commending the prime minister for dispatching Iraqi forces to surround a refinery to ensure oil did not end up on the black market. But Waxman appeared unmoved. \"Why can you talk about the positive things and not the negative things?\" he asked. \"Shouldn't we have the whole picture?\" \"I'd be very pleased to answer those questions in an appropriate setting,\" Butler replied. Waxman laughed and asked, \"An appropriate setting for positive things is a congressional hearing, but for negative things, it must be behind closed doors?\" \"As you know, this goes to the very heart of diplomatic relations and national security,\" Butler said. \"It goes to the very heart of propaganda,\" Waxman said, putting funding for anti-corruption activities through June 15, 2006, at $65 million, \"or less than 0.003 percent of the total\" spent by the Iraqi Relief and Reconstruction Fund. The State Department said details of anti-corruption efforts must be secret to protect investigators and Iraqi allies. In a letter to Rice last week, Waxman called the department's position \"ludicrous.\" Fellow Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky agreed. \"It's pretty clear that the administration just wants to muzzle any comments that reflect negatively on the [al-]Maliki government,\" he said. Earlier, the former head of the Iraqi Commission on Public Integrity, Judge Radhi Hamza al-Radhi, told the hearing that al-Maliki had protected family members from corruption investigations, citing Salam al-Maliki, Iraq's former transportation minister and the prime minister's cousin. Al-Radhi resigned last month and fled Iraq after he and his family were attacked and 31 of his anti-corruption employees were killed. He said corruption has affected \"virtually every agency and ministry, including some of the most powerful officials in Iraq.\" \"Corruption has stopped possible advances by the government on the political level, on economic reconstruction, on basic services, amenities and infrastructure and on the rule of law,\" he told the committee, estimating the total lost to corruption at $18 billion. In Baghdad, Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh acknowledged his country is plagued with a \"high level\" of corruption, but he said officials are trying to rein in the problem. U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, head of the Government Accountability Office, said there appeared to be no U.S. plan for countering the corruption. He urged Congress to consider conditioning future appropriations on such a plan \"so we can achieve some results rather than have just more efforts.\" Waxman questioned whether Iraq's government was \"too corrupt to succeed.\" If so, he added, \"We need to ask if we could, in good conscience, continue to ... prop up his regime.\" E-mail to a friend .

However, he said, the photo did initiate an investigation into goings-on at the home where the party took place, and some people were arrested on suspicion of drug possession.

Nicholson, roughly 13 years of age, is shown here with five of her sisters and two of her mothers. \"It devastated me. It elated me. It made me afraid. I looked at this man that was so powerful in my life ... and he was just so thin and pale,\" she said. Today, as Warren Jeffs sits at Utah's Purgatory Correctional Facility awaiting trial, Nicholson has started talking publicly about her childhood in the church Jeffs led -- the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS). She hopes that by sharing her story she will help others struggling with similar issues. \"My hope is that they, they'll see it, and it'll mean something,\" the 36-year-old said. Nicholson recently co-authored an article about leaving her polygamous community for Glamour magazine and is planning to write a book as well. Jeffs, whose approximately 10,000 followers practice polygamy mainly in Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, is charged in Utah with being an accomplice to rape by arranging the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin. He faces additional charges in Arizona.  Go inside Warren Jeffs' world \u00bb . As a child, Nicholson had three mothers and 12 siblings. She considers it a typical FLDS home. At the age of 14, Nicholson started sewing her wedding dress in anticipation of getting married. She knew that at any moment she could be whisked away to meet her husband and that her future likely would include at least two \"sister wives.\" But Nicholson had doubts whether she could live the life before her. \"I've always liked a lot of attention. And when it hit me that I could possibly and most likely absolutely would be sharing my husband, I began doubting that I could live that way,\" she said. That perspective got Nicholson in trouble at Alta Academy, the FLDS-run high school whose headmaster was Warren Jeffs. \"He beat the kids there. He humiliated the kids there. And as time went on and I wasn't so devoted to being perfect and sweet, he held me up as an example and humiliated me,\" she said. Jeffs would force children -- Nicholson included -- to stand on a chair in front of the class and flex their buttocks muscles, according to Nicholson. She doesn't know how he came upon this particular punishment. \"As I got more and more rebellious, he would come up behind me while I was in a group and seize me by the back of the neck and lean down and whisper in my ear, 'Are you keeping sweet or do you need to be punished?' \" she said. Jeffs wrote a letter to Nicholson's parents saying that he was concerned about her and a friend, because \"when around boys, and even younger boys, they would outwardly show their cuteness, seemingly to have the younger boys relate their cute behavior to older boys.\" After getting caught passing notes to a boy, Nicholson was expelled from Alta Academy. She began working in an FLDS-owned factory full of other youths who openly questioned their religion. It was a common destination for FLDS kids kicked out of high school. At 18, she eloped with a young man from within the community. Their marriage was not accepted by the FLDS or their families because they had gone outside of the church, to a justice of the peace, for the ceremony. So they packed up a U-Haul and headed toward California. \"That's when I cried the very most,\" she said tearfully. \"Because I was leaving my family, everything that I had ever known, my friends and God behind. And I was choosing it.\" That marriage fell apart, but in 2003 Nicholson persuaded her family to allow her brother to come live with her. He never went back. Within months, her birth mother came for a visit and she also never returned to the church. Nicholson feels fortunate she helped two relatives leave the church, but this has not been without consequence. The FLDS no longer permits Nicholson's relatives to communicate with her and she doesn't even know where the rest of her family lives. As glad as Nicholson is to see Jeffs behind bars and awaiting trial, she finds it unsettling to see a man who led the community in which she was raised now reduced to such a pathetic state. Still, she recalls a moment during Jeffs' first court appearance that showed he's not an entirely broken man. \"He had the downcast look that he would have when he was very disappointed in somebody, right before he'd start a beating or whatever or give a scolding. ... And then he looked up at the camera and gave this smirk, and that was the smirk that he would give before he damned you straight to hell or gave you the beating of your life or altered a rule that would absolutely devastate your household,\" Nicholson said. The FLDS broke from the mainline Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, over the practice of polygamy. The Mormon church, which gave up plural marriage more than a century ago, has no ties to Jeffs' group.

Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, right, meets with Richard Holbrooke in Kabul on February 15, 2009. Speaking at a joint news conference with visiting U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke, Karzai said he is \"very, very thankful\" that President Barack Obama accepted his proposal to join the review. Holbrooke is visiting Afghanistan after a trip to neighboring Pakistan. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tapped Holbrooke as special representative for the two countries, a signal of how the new administration considers Afghanistan and Pakistan intertwined in any solution to the war in Afghanistan and the terrorist threat along their shared border. At the news conference in Kabul, Holbrooke said Sunday that he conveyed the administration's support of the upcoming elections on August 20, a date recently set by Afghanistan's electoral commission. \"President Obama and Secretary Clinton and the United States government were very gratified to hear President Karzai reaffirm his support of the August 20 decision,\" Holbrooke said. Holbrooke's visit comes as Obama plans to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to fight what he's called the \"central front in our enduring struggle against terrorism and extremism.\" In an interview on CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS,\" which aired Sunday, Karzai said that, with a resurgent Taliban, a still-flourishing drug trade and a border with Pakistan believed to be home base for al Qaeda, his country can't afford for U.S. troops to leave any time soon. \"U.S. forces will not be able to leave soon in Afghanistan because the task is not over,\" Karzai said. \"We have to defeat terrorism. We'll have to enable Afghanistan to stand on its own feet. We'll have to enable Afghanistan to be able to defend itself and protect for its security ... \"Then, the United States can leave and, at that time, the Afghan people will give them plenty of flowers and gratitude and send them safely back home.\" At the same time, Karzai said the actions of troops currently in Afghanistan have turned some of the public against them. \"It's the question of civilian causalities. It's a question of risk of Afghans. It's the question of home searches,\" he said. \"These activities are seriously undermining the confidence of the Afghan people in the joint struggle we have against terrorism and undermining their hopeful future. \"We'll continue to be a friend. We'll continue to be an ally. But Afghanistan deserves respect and a better treatment.\" While he said he welcomes additional U.S. troops, Karzai suggested they need to work along the Afghan-Pakistan border and in the poppy fields that fuel a drug trade that threatens to turn the nation into a narco-state -- not in the villages where most Afghans live. \"We have traveled many years on. What should have happened early on didn't unfortunately happen,\" Karzai said. \"Now, the country is not in the same mood as it was in 2002. And so any addition of troops must have a purposeful objective that the Afghan people would agree with.\" The Obama administration is conducting several reviews of U.S. policy in Afghanistan, including a review by Gen. David Petraeus, the commander in the region. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has said the original mission in Afghanistan was \"too broad\" and needs to be more \"realistic and focused\" for the United States to succeed. \"If we set ourselves the objective of creating some sort of central Asian Valhalla over there, we will lose, because nobody in the world has that kind of time, patience and money,\" Gates said during a recent Senate hearing. He called for concrete goals that can be reached in three to five years. Speaking via satellite from Kabul, Karzai called former President George Bush \"a great person,\" but said he can work with Obama -- despite the president's comments as a candidate that Karzai had \"not gotten out of the bunker\" to improve security and infrastructure in Afghanistan. \"President Obama is a great inspiration to the world,\" he said. \"The people of America have proven that they can really be the light holders for change and the will of the people in the world. \"And his coming to power by the vote of the American people is a manifestation of that great power of the American people.\" Karzai also acknowledged corruption in the Afghan government, but defended the work he's done to combat it. \"Sure, corruption in the Afghan government is as much there as in any other third world country,\" he said. \"Suddenly this country got so much money coming from the West, suddenly so many Afghans came from all over the world to participate. Suddenly there were projects -- suddenly there were this poverty that turned into some sort form of prosperity for this country,\" he said. He said a government department has been created to deal with corruption and that corrupt judges, administrators and other officials are dismissed \"daily\" over corruption charges.", "2401b95f39c201b1738143544175f5b6399429c1": "(CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard on Thursday is searching for two fishermen missing after a commercial fishing vessel went down in remote, treacherous waters off the Aleutian Islands about 1,400 miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska. The fishing vessel Courageous helps search for missing men in waters off Alaska. Four of the boat's crew members were rescued and five bodies retrieved Wednesday near the Amchitka Pass, a strait that connects the Bering Sea to the Pacific Ocean. The names have been withheld pending the notification of families, a Coast Guard statement said. \"What can you say?\" said Jeff DeBell, chief financial officer of Katmai Fisheries, which owned the boat. He told The Associated Press, \"We are devastated by what has happened. We are elated there have been survivors. We are just terribly saddened by the ones that are dead and are praying that those that are still in the water are alive.\" The Seattle-based company told the AP the survivors were Capt. Henry Blake and crew members Guy Schroeder, Adam Foster and Harold Attling. The search began at about 1 a.m. Wednesday when the Coast Guard received an emergency signal from the Katmai, a 93-foot fishing vessel that had been battling 50-knot winds and nearly 20-foot waves. The signal originated from a wall-mounted satellite positioning device on the Katmai that reacts when it's touched or splashed with water, Coast Guard Petty Officer Levi Read said.  Watch a \"Deadliest Catch\" captain talk about what may have happened on the rough seas \u00bb . At about that time, another vessel, the Blue Balard, sent an e-mail to the Coast Guard saying that it received a message from the Katmai that water was flooding its rear compartment. The message also said that the vessel had lost steering. The Coast Guard tried to e-mail the Balard back but received no response, likely because the seas are remote and Internet access can be spotty, Read said. Rescuers launched a C-130, a long-range surveillance aircraft, and went straight to the scene twice Wednesday morning, Read said. The boat was nowhere in sight, but the C-130 did spot two strobe lights on top of the water, he said. By this time, the weather was treacherous and the sky was darkening, according to Read. The C-130, having found no signs of life, dropped two life rafts and headed back, he said. On the second trip, at 11 a.m., the C-130 and a Jayhawk helicopter found two strobe lights floating in the water, one attached to a survival suit and the other to the emergency device that had first alerted the Coast Guard, Read said. They also found a body, he said. \"We knew the person was from the Katmai because the suit he was wearing had the name of the vessel on it,\" Read said. Roughly five hours later, the Coast Guard spotted four men on a life raft, all wearing survival suits. With the assistance of other vessels, the Courageous and the Patricia Lee, the bodies of four other men were recovered from the water, all wearing survival suits, Read said. The odds of someone surviving the frigid waters off Alaska's Aleutian Islands is minimal, said Read. Crews usually have survival suits that allow water to seep inside but have a mechanism that traps body heat. The search for the two remaining men began at 9:30 a.m. Alaska time Thursday, an hour before sunrise there. \"You just couldn't do anything earlier,\" Read said. \"It's darker the farther out you go, and they are really, really out there.\"", "63ca2843721d74accb08f480df5eff6f77322a82": "(CNN) -- An Islamic militia took over two strategic towns in Somalia Tuesday in a territory grab by the strengthening insurgency, a regional commander told CNN. Islamist fighters from Al-Shabaab group in Somalia display their flag. The al-Shabaab militia seized the cities of Bulo Marer and Quryoley from the U.N.-backed government and its Ethiopian allies. The move gives the group a strategic base in central Somalia, where it also controls Kismayo, the country's third-largest city. Al-Shabaab is an offshoot of an Islamic party that ruled much of the country in the second half of 2006 and aims to impose Islamic sharia law in Somalia. Nur Shekoy Jabril, the commander of government forces in Quryoley, said his troops withdrew from the two towns after they faced being overwhelmed by the al-Shabaab force. He said al-Shabaab forces were moving toward Merka, another major town in the region where the Untied Nations uses an air strip to fly in supplies for the World Food Programme. Somalia, which has not had a functioning government since 1991, is in the throes of an Islamic insurgency which is battling for control of the country and the ouster of Ethiopian forces. A cease-fire between the some of the Islamic fighters and the Somali transitional government takes effect on Wednesday. The agreement was brokered by the United Nations and the African Union and signed late last month in Djibouti. It calls for Ethiopian forces -- who are supporting the transitional government forces -- to withdraw starting on November 21. It is unclear if the cease-fire will hold as it has already been rejected by Al Shabaab.

Blockbusters like \"Finding Nemo\" and Dreamworks' franchise \"Shrek\" have turned animation into a multi-billion-dollar industry, and a market once dominated by Disney is becoming crowded with competition. This year, Pixar celebrates its 20th anniversary. From \"Toy Story\" to \"Ratatouille,\" the company has transformed expectations about what's possible with animated film. Pixar's position as a world leader in animated film is largely down to John Lasseter - considered by some to be the Walt Disney for a new generation. From \"Toy Story\" and \"A Bug's Life\" to \"Monsters, Inc.\" and \"Cars,\" the Pixar back-catalogue is a testament to his creative genius. And when Pixar merged with Disney he became one of the most powerful players in the movie business. The first Pixar production released since the merger is \"Ratatouille,\" the story of an unlikely alliance between a blundering trainee chef and a gourmet-loving rat. \"Ratatouille\" director Brad Bird's credits for Pixar include the Oscar-winning feature \"The Incredibles,\" which won critical plaudits for its ground-breaking animation. He told CNN, \"I think that one of the nice things about Pixar is that they don't feel like they have discovered the secret formula to making a good movie. They just keep focused on trying to make a movie that they would want to see. We are challenged and surprised every time they work out.\" But while Pixar and Disney may be the giants of animation they face formidable competition from another box-office monster -- Shrek. The adventures of the world's favorite ogre have generated a total of two billion dollars in takings. Actor Mike Myers, who voices Shrek, told CNN that he thinks the movies' appeal is their unlikely hero. He said, \"With 'Shrek,' they took fairytales and turned them on their heads. Everything is inverted. Traditional villains are heroes, traditional heroes are villains. The whole team decided, we're going to look at somebody who has been told he was a villain and we're going to make him a hero. That's when I knew they were on to something.\" The success of the Shrek franchise, supported by other big budget features such as \"Madagascar,\" has cemented Dreamworks' position as a major force in the animated world. Another successful franchise -- \"Ice Age\" -- has been a hot seller for 20th Century Fox. And the polar climate has also been kind to Warner Brothers with last year's Oscar-winning \"Happy Feet\" charming audiences around the world with a tale of dancing penguins, while the Tom Hanks-voiced \"The Polar Express\" also scored well on its way to becoming a seasonal stocking-filler on DVD. The life-like motion-capture technique used in \"The Polar Express\" will also feature in Warner's forthcoming release, \"Beowulf\" featuring Angelina Jolie. But in a market dominated by 3-D CGI animations, one of the big three summer blockbusters this year belongs to a more traditional form of the art. \"The Simpsons Movie\" is the world's longest-running animated television series, and fans have eagerly awaited its move to the big screen. Creator Matt Groening told the Screening Room, \"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years. We've had kids, they've grown up, they've become adults, they've become writers for the Simpsons, so we had to do a movie after all this time.\" So, will Springfield's most famous inhabitants break all former animation records? Groening and co. will certainly be hoping that the movie gets a box-office \"Woo hoo!\" from its fans. \"Happy Feet\" is a Warner Bros. film; Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.

Civilians are overcome with emotion outside a home destroyed by a U.S. airstrike in Afghanistan. And despite Afghanistan's outrage over the loss of life, he said, the incident has not undermined the nations' relationship. The Afghanistan government has said that as many as 90 civilians -- including many children -- were killed in the August 22 air attack on a village in the Shindand district of Western Afghanistan. The United States had said that only seven civilians died, along with dozens of insurgents. A number of investigations into the incident are under way, including a \"senior level\" review by the United States. \"People who are reviewing our findings have been in Afghanistan for a while, and I don't know when they will complete their review,\" Wood said at the State Department late Friday. \"There is no American involved who doesn't feel a personal sense of pain and regret any time any civilian casualty occurs,\" he said. \"Speaking as an official of the American government, I can say there is no one who works harder than the United States does to minimize such casualties. \"I know as a matter of absolute certainty of operations that have been canceled precisely because there was a risk of civilian casualties,\" he added. \"I think there is no question there has been what one Afghan official referred to as 'sort of a bumpy time' over this issue in the last few weeks. I think that it has never threatened the underlying relationship of confidence between our two countries and between our peoples or between our military and the people of Afghanistan. \"That said, we are certainly committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure that such casualties are reduced to the absolute minimum and to working closely, even more closely, with the Afghan government to successfully carry out the military mission.\" The ambassador said the United States has made changes in communication between the U.S. and Afghan forces. \"Steps are already not simply under way but have been taken to improve coordination,\" he said. U.S. and Afghanistan officials have just completed a new round in what is called the United States-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership. A joint U.S.-Afghanistan statement released Thursday referred to the attack. \"The United States delegation expressed regret over the loss of any innocent civilian lives incurred during security operations,\" the statement said. \"In response to concerns expressed by the government of Afghanistan, the United States is conducting a senior level review and assessment of the August 22 Shindand operation. In addition, both sides recognize the need for establishing a mutually agreed-upon framework and mechanism to minimize civilian casualties and to maintain the strong support of the Afghan people in fighting terrorism.\"", "f6637a6c30e7175aa86490edc177f8409d00c57d": "(CNN) -- Sudan's government and rebels from its troubled Darfur region signed a confidence-building agreement Tuesday in Qatar, a step toward ending a six-year conflict that has killed about 300,000 people, the emirate's state news agency reported. A member of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) stands guard near the Sudan-Chad border in 2007. Detailed talks between the government and the Justice and Equality Movement are scheduled to begin in two weeks after Tuesday's signing, Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabr al-Thani, Qatar's prime minister, told the SUNA news agency. Roger Middleton, an Africa specialist at the British think-tank Chatham House, said Tuesday's agreement deals mostly with prisoner releases. But he said the two parties' decision to hold further talks \"is an important move forward, which there hasn't necessarily been in the past.\" \"It is certainly a step in the right direction,\" he said. \"But a lot more needs to be done if we're going to see a full cessation of fighting in Darfur.\" Other rebel groups are not included in the pact, and \"many, many things\" could cause the talks to fail, he said. \"It is a start, but it's very fragile, and we mustn't get overexcited just yet,\" Middleton said. In November, Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir agreed to an immediate, unconditional cease-fire in Darfur, but JEM was not included in the talks. Sudan's Culture Minister Amin Hassan Omar and Jibril Ibrahim, a top rebel official, signed Tuesday's agreement. Qatar has been mediating talks between the two sides in the Darfur conflict, which erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Khartoum government. The government launched a brutal counter-insurgency campaign, aided by government-backed Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. Al-Bashir is under pressure to end the fighting, particularly because he was charged with genocide by the International Criminal Court last year for the government's campaign of violence in Darfur. In the past six years, an estimated 300,000 people have been killed through direct combat, disease or malnutrition, the United Nations says. An additional 2.7 million people fled their homes because of fighting among rebels, government forces and allied militias.", "7291796705735c70ebc81b0ad333f16839f2c728": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The first child in Britain known to have been screened as an embryo to ensure she did not carry a cancer gene was born Friday, a spokesman for University College London told CNN. Genetic screening allows lab-fertilized embryos to be tested for genes likely to lead to later health problems. Her embryo was screened in a lab days after conception to check for the BRCA-1 gene, linked to breast and ovarian cancer. People with the gene are known to have a 50-80 percent chance of developing breast or ovarian cancer in their lifetimes. British newspapers have dubbed the girl the \"cancer-free\" baby. \"This little girl will not face the specter of developing this genetic form of breast cancer or ovarian cancer in her adult life,\" said Paul Serhal, a consultant at University College London Hospital and Medical Director of the Assisted Conception Unit. \"The parents will have been spared the risk of inflicting this disease on their daughter. The lasting legacy is the eradication of the transmission of this form of cancer that has blighted these families for generations.\" Yet not everyone is thrilled with the idea of testing embryos for genes that could cause health problems later in life, a process known as preimplanatation genetic diagnosis. \"This is not a cure for breast cancer,\" said Josephine Quintavalle, co-founder of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, which describes itself as group that focuses on ethical dilemmas related to reproduction. What do you think about testing embryos for gene defects? \"This is simply a mechanism for eliminating the birth of anybody (prone to) the disease,\" she said. \"It is basically a search-and-kill mechanism.\" She opposes the procedure because embryos found to carry disease-causing genes often are discarded. She says that is essentially murder. \"They will be destroyed,\" she said. \"They will never be allowed to live.\" Doctors in Britain and elsewhere increasingly test embryos for genes that are certain to cause illnesses such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's Disease. What's different about the girl born Friday is that she is the first infant known to have been tested in Britain as an embryo for a gene that is merely likely -- not certain -- to cause disease. In the United States, geneticists are free to test for any condition for which they can develop a probe -- and they're free to look for genes that are certain to cause diseases as well as genes that merely may pose problems later in life. Quintavalle opposes any form of in-vitro fertilization where embryos are \"killed,\" she said. But she is particularly troubled by the idea of screening an embryo for the BRCA-1 gene because carriers of the gene do not always develop the disease, and the disease is not always fatal. \"The message we are sending is: 'Better off dead than carrying (a gene linked to) breast cancer,'\" she said. \"We have gone very much down the proverbial slippery slope.\" Peter Braude, one of the top British experts on the genetic testing of embryos, said he understands the ethical objections but focuses on the benefits. \"There has always been a vociferous group in opposition,\" he said. But \"there are people who can benefit and I think they should be allowed to do so.\" In fact, he argues that the procedure actually prevents abortions because it takes place on a three-day old embryo in a lab. Only embryos that lack the defective gene are implanted. \"I don't think you can equate eight cells in a dish to an embryo or a child,\" said Braude, head of the department of women's health at the King's College London School of Medicine. For many couples, the alternative to testing an embryo is to conceive a child naturally and test the fetus weeks or months into a pregnancy. Some couples opt for an abortion when such testing reveals a defect. Diagnosing an embryo genetically typically involves fertilizing an egg with a sperm in a lab, testing the resulting embryo and implanting it in the mother if no defects are found. Braude agrees that testing for diseases that may not be fatal -- or may not manifest themselves for decades -- raises thorny ethical questions. \"How serious does it have to be before you throw away an embryo?\" he asked. \"Are you prepared to throw away a 16-week embryo for Huntington's, which will not manifest until age 40?\" In Britain, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority determines the conditions for which geneticists can test. It has approved testing for more than 60 conditions since it was established in 1990. The authority approved testing for the BRCA-1 gene in 2008. Dr. Mark Hughes, who founded a genetics clinic in the United States, said he likes the idea of an authority that regulates what tests can be performed -- the system in place in Britain -- but believes that parents who want to test for genetic abnormalities should be allowed to do so. At his Genesis Genetics Institute in Detroit, Michigan, Hughes carries out about two tests a month for BRCA-1 or BRCA-2, a related gene. \"The couple is the best one to be making these decisions, because they live with these diseases,\" he said. \"When it hits your family over and over again, many couples are saying: 'Enough of this. Let's prune this out of our family tree forever.'\" He rejects the notion that parents will use genetic testing to remove all imperfections from children. \"You can get up on your high horse and say people are looking for perfect children, but let's give these families more credit,\" he said. \"They just want one that has a fighting chance of not having a disease.\" Hughes said he doubts genetic screening will ever be used to test all babies. That's partly because it costs the equivalent of about $11,755 -- 8,000 British pounds -- to screen embryos. It's also because the process is very complex. \"It's gotten easier to do now than it was 19 years ago,\" when Hughes did his first test for cystic fibrosis, he said. \"But it has not exploded, not burst onto the medical field like some technologies do. \"No one would use these technologies for a trivial reason. It's too much effort,\" he said. \"Not just the money -- it's so many hoops to jump through for a couple that would prefer to make their baby on vacation rather than in a clinic.\"", "369f23c601eb404faf7e0a41ef5bb537e02ebed2": "(CNN) -- Legendary singer/songwriter Aretha Franklin sang \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" at the inauguration Tuesday.

I was not happy with it, but I just feel blessed because it could have been five above zero or five below zero like it is in Detroit. I was still blessed to be able to pretty much just sing the melody, but I wasn't happy with it, of course. King: It was great to listen to. Franklin: I was delighted and thrilled to be there.

Zimbabweans walk through mounds of garbage. Lack of sanitation and clean water make cholera spread. The newly formed cabinet of Zimbabwe's unity government met for the first time Tuesday, the same day that Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) released a report warning that the epidemic shows no signs of slowing. The outbreak -- one of the world's largest, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) -- is only getting worse, and could be a stepping-stone to other epidemics and health crises, international agencies say. Since August, at least 3,623 people have died and 76,127 people have been infected by cholera, a preventable water-borne bacterial illness that causes severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration and can lead to death in a matter of days if not treated. According to a report released Tuesday by Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), new cholera patients were being registered at a rate of one every minute at the beginning of February in Zimbabwe. Unless urgent action is taken, the aid group said, the country could see a worsening of the \"massive medical emergency that is spiraling out of control,\" MSF President Dr. Christophe Fournier told CNN Tuesday after his latest visit to Zimbabwe. MSF says the response from the international community to the crisis has been slow and inadequate, and it called on donors to put aside politics and send help immediately. The cholera epidemic has been left to fester as the Zimbabwean government grappled with questionable elections, opposition charges of fraud, power-sharing talks and the creation of a unity government in the last year. During that time, the country's economy and infrastructure imploded, with sanitation systems and garbage collection becoming virtually non-existent. \"The reasons for the (cholera) outbreak are clear: lack of access to clean water, burst and blocked sewage systems, and uncollected refuse overflowing in the streets, all clear symptoms of the breakdown in infrastructure resulting from Zimbabwe's political and economic meltdown,\" the MSF report said. The disease is contracted \"by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacterium,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on its Web site. \"In an epidemic, the source of the contamination is usually the feces of an infected person,\" the CDC said. \"The disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water.\" Making matters worse, flooding from the rainy season -- which began in November -- is spreading the bacteria through swollen streams and rivers. Cholera cases have now been reported in all of the country's provinces, the MSF report said. Exacerbating the epidemic is the current economic crisis, which has caused the health care system to nearly grind to a halt. \"I've seen many health services being down like this in my life as an MSF doctor, but only in this country have I seen this kind of collapse of the public health care system in the absence of any conflict,\" Fournier said. He said most of the country's public hospitals or clinics are either closed or empty, and the ones that are open face critical shortages of drugs and medical equipment. \"A huge part of the medical staff is not showing up because they are unpaid and on top of that, the patients, when finally accessing one opened facility, are asked for totally indecent amounts of money only to be seen and then an extra amount of money for their treatment,\" Fournier added. Many patients can't afford to pay and don't even bother to seek treatment, he said. MSF believes cholera may be just the beginning of a nightmare health crisis in the southern African country. \"The current food shortages make us fear of further malnutrition among the most vulnerable, starting with the under (age) five children, where any kind of infectious epidemic can start at any moment after this current cholera epidemic,\" Fournier explained. MSF currently has more than 500 staff members working in Zimbabwe to battle the outbreak. The organization is calling on the government to remove barriers that are slowing the MSF response to the crisis. \"Despite the glaring humanitarian needs, the government of Zimbabwe continues to exert rigid control over aid organizations. MSF faces restrictions in implementing medical assessments and interventions,\" the group's report said. \"The Zimbabwean government must facilitate independent assessments of need, guarantee that aid agencies can work wherever needs are identified and ease bureaucratic restrictions so that programs can be staffed properly and drugs procured quickly,\" the report said. Manuel Lopez, the chief of MSF's mission in Zimbabwe, said the cost of importing medicine is often higher than the cost of the drugs themselves. High fees for visas and work permits for staff are also impeding operations, he said. And it often takes months to get permission for MSF specialists to operate inside the country, Lopez explained, with some eventually being turned down.", "9a0d14155b86e213894dc6af412b5ae6a3423e72": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- Eight police personnel were killed in an early-morning attack Saturday on a police security checkpoint in Pakistan's Punjab province, a police official said. The attack happened at 3:30 a.m. Saturday (2230 GMT Friday). Some personnel were asleep in the checkpost guard quarters and others were standing guard when unknown militants attacked the checkpost from their vehicle, a police official from the Mianwali district of the province said. All the men were killed by gunfire. The attackers then blew up the checkpost with explosives, the police official said. The checkpoint was part of the NATO supply routes transporting goods from the port city of Karachi through Pakistan's northwestern region and tribal areas into Afghanistan. Police told CNN that an attack a few days ago also targeted a checkpoint in the Mianwali district. Rocket fire damaged the top level of building but no one was killed in the attack.", "65029e0d677a79ed0c3f3fdf91ed346bc44910e5": "HONG KONG, China (CNN)  -- Bamboo, woven into the shape of human stomachs. Red, sky blue and orange pencil shavings glued onto a large canvas form a woman's traditional hair clip. A collage of magazine clippings, drawings and found materials depict Cambodia's tumultuous modern history. Leang Seckon's \"Prison Guard\" depicts Duch, who is facing a genocide tribunal starting Tuesday. These are a few of the offerings on hand in Hong Kong at one of the first large international exhibitions of artists from Cambodia. The work by 14 artists varies in practice-- video, photography, collage, wood shavings, paper, bamboo and painting-- as well as in themes, from reflecting on the Southeast Asian nation's genocidal Khmer Rouge regime to the emerging modern Cambodia, with traffic lights and all. \"Every artist in this show is referencing ancient tradition and recent history,\" said Phnom Penh-based curator Erin Gleeson, noting the wall-size depiction in folded paper of the serpent Naga (which in Cambodian culture represents the people's mythical birth) to a collage of 20th-century Cambodia and its six different regime changes. \"The show is looking at the present -- 'Forever Until Now' is the title -- and it is this lineage of the past, you see that in the show, and then you see artists that arrive at the present,\" she added. The show opens Friday and runs through March 22 at 10 Chancery Lane Gallery. Gallery owner and director Katie de Tilly said she believed it was important the artists get international exposure. \" ... it's really at the beginning of their art emergence. Obviously, they've had a very hard history,\" she said. \"This is really the beginning of contemporary Cambodians who are expressing very original ideas in their artworks and I think that that's what makes it very unique and to show to the rest of the world.\" Cambodia, which lost an estimated one-quarter of its population or at least 1.7 million people -- including an estimated 90 percent of its artists -- under the 1970s Khmer Rouge regime, has a small but growing artistic community: there are some 50 practicing artists out of its 14 million people, Gleeson said. The genocide and ensuing war, which only ended in the last decade or so, stifled the development of the arts in one of the world's poorest countries. \"The legacy of that is now in every facet of a developing society,\" said Gleeson, who noted the country had no art books when she arrived in 2002 on a fellowship to teach art history. \"There's an absence of infrastructure for them, there's an absence of materials, there is no art store. ... they are quite inventive about mixing materials to make them of a higher quality or last longer, but in many cases they don't know archival techniques.\" The harsh weather conditions -- a dusty, hot season and a rainy monsoon -- add to the trying work conditions. \"Everything's against them,\" she added. \"Their parents in many cases are coming from a really disadvantaged background, as the majority of the country is economically.\" Some of the art included in the show looks at the Cambodia of today, such as Leang Seckon's \"Three Greens\" -- an acrylic painting showing children in school uniform crossing a road with a yellow light, red light and three green lights, along with cows and roosters. The piece shows the changes in a country that recently got stop lights, with animals, people and traffic mingling on the main roads of the capital. Sopheap Pich, a Cambodian-American whose family migrated to the U.S. in 1984, works with bamboo and rattan -- materials often used in Cambodian traditional farming and crafts -- to make sculptures. His work, \"Cycle 2,\" is the joining of the stomachs of an infant and an elderly person that for him brought up ideas of Cambodian traditional village life. \"You belong to each other, you help each other out,\" he said. \"But also, if you look at the lines and you see how it's shaped by hand, it's not very perfect, so it's also about struggle... \"You could say it's a cycle of trying to hold onto each other, now we are living everywhere in the world, Cambodians are all over the planet,\" he added. \"All this technique and pattern that I am quite obsessed with ... it's about this idea of trying to hold on with very simple means.\" Chan Dany, a 25-year-old artist who graduated from one of the country's three art schools, creates textured patterns that appear almost like tapestry using pencil shavings in various colors. The works on display in the show are from a series based on Cambodian architectural decor, such as door and window shutter carvings, and include ancient Khmer forms whose shapes are derived from nature. \"When I started learning art, the teacher introduced a lot of new ways of making art, new ideas that were very difficult for me, so I had to think a lot,\" he said through a translator. \"So then I looked around at what my classmates were doing and I started to think about what they weren't using for their work, so I started to collect the things that they didn't use when they were making art and started to think about my way of making art using those materials.\" \"I like the first piece I did (using the pencil shaving technique) because I had never done it this way before and since then I kept on making it,\" he said. The younger artists \"seem to be expressing something more fresh,\" while the work by artists from the older generation is \"much more heavy,\" de Tilly said. Some of the works of the Khmer Rouge period include a painting by Vann Nath, one of seven people to survive the regime's infamous S-21 torture prison. His painting, \"Pray for Peace,\" depicts women wearing traditional Cambodian funeral scarves praying en masse under troubled skies by stormy seas. Another work, Leang's \"Prison Guard,\" tells the life of Duch, a former teacher who ran S-21 and goes on trial Tuesday before a U.N.-backed tribunal on charges that include crimes against humanity. The art scene has been growing slowly in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh over the last few years: Sopheap started a group to promote contemporary Cambodian art practices and two art institutes offer programs apart from the Royal University of Fine Arts. One factor that has also made Cambodian contemporary artists different from their counterparts, for example in neighboring Vietnam, has been the lack of outside influence, such as was the case with Chinese contemporary art 30 years ago, de Tilly said. \"Cambodia still is very much influenced by itself and so the development is happening on a slower pace but as well very interesting,\" she said. \"They seem to not have as much international exposure to materials, magazines, publications, so you really do feel -- it was the same just after the Cultural Revolution in China -- that they didn't have exposure to many publications and things, and so their art was developing at that moment in time.\" \" ... it's very interesting to document it and see what's going to happen in the future,\" she said. Part of the exhibit will be shown at another of the gallery's venues in Hong Kong and will run through April 25.", "75c8898204f01e677486bf85b3333384a76dd78f": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Turkey launched another round of airstrikes against Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq on Sunday, an Iraqi official said.

The official said the Turkish military operation started at 5:30 p.m. and lasted an hour and a half. There were no reports of casualties. Turkey said it was the sixth time in the past week it attacked the PKK in response to clashes that left at least 15 Turkish troops dead in the Turkey-Iraq border region last weekend. The central Iraqi government has labeled the PKK a terrorist organization, banning its activities and closing its offices in the country two years ago. The United States and the European Union also consider the PKK a terrorist group. It was the second round of Turkish strikes on northern Iraq this weekend. Late Friday and early Saturday, Turkish warplanes hit 31 targets in the Hakurk region of northern Iraq before returning. They \"successfully completed the operation [and] safely returned to their bases,\" the Turkish military said. A spokesman for the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Security Forces said Turkish warplanes and artillery units bombed the region from around 11 p.m. Friday until 1 a.m. Saturday. The spokesman, Jabbar Yawer, said there were no reports of casualties. Turkish artillery shells also hit border villages in the Zakho area, targeting PKK positions for about an hour on Saturday afternoon, Yawer said. Though the Iraqi government opposes the PKK, the organization continues to operate in the Qandil Mountains in northern Iraq bordering Turkey and Iran.

Job losses suffered by Linda and Chris Metzger have had a ripple effect on other businesses in their community . In early March 2008, 31-year-old Linda Metzger went to the New York office where she had worked as an assistant vice president in the marketing department at Lehman Brothers for about a year. Only 15 minutes into her work day, Metzger was called into her manager's office, where a representative from human resources was waiting. \"They told me that the company was having economic difficulties and that they had to make budget cuts,\" Metzger said. \"They were afraid that they were going to have to let me go and that it was not due to performance.\" Metzger says that would be her last day at Lehman Brothers. She was given some time to collect her composure, gather her belongings and head home. She was out of a $90,000-a-year job and was getting married in three months. Metzger says it was a chance for her and her fianc\u00e9 to refocus, relocate and start a new life. Within a few weeks, they both found jobs near Phoenix, Arizona, earning close to what they were making in New York. They bought a home and two new cars and got married. But the good feelings suddenly and dramatically ended in October when Metzger, who was four months pregnant, showed up to work at Lumension, where she was a marketing manager. Metzger says she was called into the office, and it happened again. She was laid off from her second job in less than a year.  Watch Linda talk about getting laid off \u00bb . \"I was so overwhelmed and so shocked that I just immediately burst into tears.\" She thought about how she and her new husband, who had just moved across the country, were going to be able to afford their new life and all the bills that came with it. A week later, Chris Metzger was called into his manager's office at the job placement agency where he worked. He was told that because of the economy, his office was closing, and he was out of a job. Now he had to break the news to his wife. \"I just came home, and she was upstairs,\" Chris Metzger said. He tried to find the best way to tell his wife that they no longer had an income. \"I walked upstairs, I gave her a hug, and I said, 'I lost my job today.' \" \"I immediately fell to the floor and just started crying,\" Linda said. Within 10 days, Chris was able to find a new job, but Linda had no such luck. The economy was taking its toll, and very few companies were hiring. They looked at their budget and started to eliminate all the extras, including dining out and gym memberships. Vacations were put on hold; furniture purchases had to wait; fine meals out were now home-cooked meals. The Metzgers' story is playing out all across America as businesses and communities feel the ripple effect of the recession . \"When jobs get lost, demand falls for a whole bunch of businesses. You're not going to buy new shoes; you're going to put new soles on them,\" said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, an independent group that studies recessions. Restaurants where the Metzgers used to dine are now closed. The furniture store where they hoped to fill their home is having a liquidation sale and is closing in three weeks. \"You've pulled back from all your spending except paying your mortgage and putting food on the table,\" Achuthan said. It's a sign of the times. A drive down the Phoenix streets and strip malls are filled with vacant office space . Chris and Linda Metzger are expecting their first child in April. This month, they had to decide between making an expensive COBRA insurance payment or the mortgage payment, and they may have to start asking family for help. Despite her education and work experience, Linda Metzger says she is hoping she can start a genealogy business. She just doesn't feel good about jumping back into the work force after her baby is born. \"I am feeling a little burnt -- sorry, very burnt by corporate America.\"", "28e35b68caf037877b527d723704215db796acf6": "(CNN) -- The only thing Venus Williams treasures more than winning is a decent nap. Venus Williams knocks Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova out of the  Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships on February 17, 2009. Just before a match, when other top tennis players might be psyching themselves up for a three-set onslaught, the elder of the Williams sisters can be found somewhere private, snoozing. \"I'm always sleepy,\" she told CNN in an interview for this month's edition of \"Revealed.\" \"I'm literally taking a nap during the first set and the match before me, so I'm probably the only person that can go to sleep, come out 15 minutes later and start playing.\" Wary of sending the wrong signals to her rivals, the sixth seed confessed to CNN that she prefers to take her naps in private. \"I'm wondering if my competitor is going to see me here, so I try to act like I'm not asleep, but I am asleep, or I try to find a place where I can sleep in and no one will see me,\" she laughs. The lightning-fast speed of Venus' serve is at complete odds with her personality. She is strong, ambitious and determined, but also surprisingly laid-back for someone whose professional career is about playing harder, longer and faster. \"I just always go with the flow,\" she told CNN. \"On the court, that's when I get most intense. In practice, I scream and yell and threaten to throw my racquet but in the match I'm not like that at all.\" Her younger sister, world number one Serena, sounds almost envious of Venus' ability to keep her emotions in check. \"Venus is really, really unusually composed and that's just her style,\" Serena told CNN. \"On the court she's always really focused. She always has this quiet tenacity and she never really shows her emotions which I think is good.\" The youngest of five sisters, Serena says she continues to draw inspiration from her closest sibling. Venus is just 15 months older than Serena. She set the marker for success in 2002 when she became the first of the sisters to become world number one. Serena first took the title in July of the same year and reclaimed it earlier this month. \"She's my bigger sister, she's my older sister, she's a role model for me,\" Serena said. \"I'm always trying to do what she does. If she's going on the right path then I'm going on the right path too. If she's working hard then I want to work hard also. I'm the little sister who wants to be just like the big sister,\" she added. If they once struggled to find the required ruthlessness to eliminate each other from a competition, it is clearly no longer a problem. Of 18 matches they have contested, each sister has won nine. At the time of writing, there is every chance they will meet again this week in the semi-final of the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships. They last clashed at the Sony Ericsson Championships in Doha in November 2008 when Venus dispatched Serena in three hard-fought sets before going on to win her first end of season title. Asked after the match about accusations they don't play as hard against each other as they would normal rivals, Venus replied, \"You have to play hard against a Williams or you are going home quickly. We try our hardest and I think that everyone knows that by the effort level.\" Their mother, Oracene Price, told CNN she keeps her advice on the subject simple. \"I just tell them to remember they are sisters and how love and how to care for one another is more important than anything,\" she said. \"So, this is just a game and eventually it would be over and you will have to live with each other. So, just go out there and do your best and whoever wins, wins. And whoever loses, better luck next time.\" Having said that, Price admits she keeps her distance from whoever comes out second best, in any match. \"They don't want to be talked to, they don't want you telling them anything, they just want to be left alone and that's what I do,\" she told CNN. There is no need for tip-toeing today. Venus made fast work of Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, beating the 17-year-old 6-0, 6-1 in less than one hour in the second round of the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships. Venus told CNN her ambition this year is to topple Serena to become the world number one. \"I think I am in a great position to do that,\" she said.

Sen. Sherrod Brown speaks to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid at right on the Senate floor Friday. Approved earlier by the House, the plan -- which went through multiple permutations as it bounced back and forth on Capitol Hill over the past week -- now goes to Obama's desk, where he plans to sign it into law by Presidents Day. Spending in the package includes about $120 billion for infrastructure -- new projects repairing bridges, roads, government buildings and the like -- more than $100 billion for education and $30 billion on energy-related projects that Obama says will create \"green jobs.\" More than $212 billion goes to tax breaks for individuals and businesses, and another $267 billion is in direct spending like food stamps and unemployment benefits. The Congressional Budget Office has predicted that the plan will create between 1 million and 3 million jobs. Most individuals will get a $400 tax credit, and couples will get $800. The vote by the Senate took several hours longer than a simple roll call of its 100 members generally would. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, attended a wake for his mother until about 8 p.m. Friday. Voting began about 5:30 p.m. Then, the Senate chamber sat nearly empty until Brown arrived to vote about five hours later. He was flown from Ohio to Washington on a plane provided by the White House, which said no commercial flights were available that would have allowed Brown to cast a vote and return to Ohio in time for his mother's funeral Saturday. As had been the case when the original version of the package passed, the stimulus package garnered no Republican support in the House. The compromise legislation, which was hammered out by House and Senate leaders and White House staff over the past several days, passed in the House on a 246-183 vote. Three Republicans -- Susan Collins and Olympia Snow of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania -- supported it in the Senate. Their support was needed to give the plan the 60 votes needed to keep it from being shut down by Republican parliamentary procedures. All Democrats in the Senate supported the plan. Seven House Democrats opposed it. Although the package was signed off on by leadership Thursday, a written version wasn't available to most lawmakers until about 11 p.m. Some Republicans in the House expressed frustration over how little time they had to read the 1,000-plus-page bill, and others predicted ruin if it passed.  Watch the stimulus pass without GOP support \u00bb . \"Just because Republicans spent too much money after September 11 and lost our way on financial matters doesn't mean the Democratic party should be allowed to wreck our ship of state,\" said Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tennessee. \"This is taking us quickly down the wrong road. Vote no.\"  Watch the GOP say 'Americans deserve better' \u00bb . Other lawmakers, however, said they were hopeful the stimulus plan would get the economy back on track. \"We know this bill alone will not solve all of our economic woes overnight. We know that the road back to economic stability and prosperity will require hard work over time,\" said Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Colorado. \"But this bill is the right size and scope necessary to truly help us turn things around.\" Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, who returned to Capitol Hill for votes this week, was not present for the final vote because he returned to Florida to continue his recovery from brain cancer. The bill passed the Senate 60-38. Here's how the compromise bill is expected to affect individuals: . Most individuals will get a $400 tax credit, and most couples will get an $800 credit. That amounts to an extra $13 a week in a person's paycheck, starting in June. That's less than what Obama campaigned on: $500 for individuals and $1,000 per couple. Many students will get a $2,500 tuition tax credit. First-time home buyers may qualify for a tax credit of up to $8,000. People who receive Social Security will get a one-time payment of $250. The overall package is estimated to be 35 percent tax cuts and 65 percent spending, Democratic sources said.

The army has been deployed in major cities aross Italy since the early summer. Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa told the ANSA press agency Tuesday that ''the majority'' of the troops would be sent to the southern city of Naples following the worst ever Camorra massacre last week, that left an Italian and six Africans dead. La Russa said that the 500 troops will be in addition to the 3,000 soldiers deployed alongside police in major Italian cities this summer, ANSA reported. ''The troops could be deployed for three months and (perform) the functions of manning check points,'' he said. This will be the second time since the 1990s that the army has been sent in to combat Mafia crime in southern Italy, ANSA said. Thousands of soldiers were sent to Sicily in 1992 following the murder of anti-Mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. They stayed on the southern island until 1998 in an operation dubbed the Sicilian Vespers. The Casalesi Camorra clan is believed to have been behind Thursday's killings, which began with the shooting of an amusement arcade's 53-year-old Italian owner, known to have had links with the clan, ANSA said. Twenty minutes later, three Ghanaians, two Liberians and a Togo national were shot dead at a shop where local residents often brought clothes for minor adjustments. A third Liberian died in hospital Friday morning. According to ANSA, police said the murders were drug-related but also ''a signal'' that the Casalesi were still strong in the area despite a raft of recent arrests. The Casalesi clan is one of the most feared Camorra gangs. It controls drug trafficking and prostitution in the Caserta region, near Naples.", "5eb2bc3b42232bf1b2f246780c9e8cc8d61c1d0d": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani government officials announced Monday an agreement with the Taliban to allow strict Islamic law, or sharia, to be implemented in parts of North West Frontier Province. Delegation members of pro-Taliban leader Soofi Mohammad at a meeting in Peshawar Monday. It marks a major concession by the Pakistani government in its attempt to hold off Taliban militants who have terrorized the region with beheadings, kidnappings, and the destruction of girls' schools. The government will recognize sharia for the entire Malakand Division, which includes the Swat district -- a two-hour drive from Pakistan's capital, Islamabad -- the chief minister of North West Frontier Province Amir Haider Hoti announced Monday in a news conference. Islamic law is already being practiced in the area, where the Taliban have control. Hoti said the people of the region want sharia which will fill the \"vacuum\" left by a lack of access to Pakistan's judicial system. He said he hoped it would bring peace to the region, where Pakistani forces have battled militants aligned with the Taliban. \"Those who chose to take the path of violence because of this decision, I appeal to all of them to work for the sake of peace now,\" Hoti said. \"There is no accounting for the sacrifice of all the people of Swat and the Malakand division. How many children have been orphaned? How many parents have lost their children? How many young people have been martyred? In my mind, I don't think that anyone can take this any more.\"  Watch Pakistan's foreign minister discuss negotiating with the Taliban \u00bb . He also stressed that the recognition of Islamic law in the region \"isn't something that hasn't happened before.\" He said previous agreements have been made regarding sharia, but were never implemented. He also said that the Islamic law will not go against basic civil liberties, although he did not explain how the government would make sure that provision would be upheld.  Watch the implications of the concessions to the Taliban \u00bb . Sharia is defined as Islamic law but is interpreted with wide differences depending on the various sects of both Sunni and Shia Islam. So far, the Pakistani Taliban's interpretation of sharia has included banning girls from school, forcing women inside and outlawing forms of entertainment. The agreement comes amid negotiations between Pakistani provincial officials and Taliban representatives, led by Sufi Mohammed. The Taliban on Sunday declared a 10-day cease-fire in Swat Valley, which Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan said was a gesture of good will towards the government. The Taliban's control of Swat is believed to be the deepest advance by militants into Pakistan's settled areas -- meaning areas outside its federally administered tribal region along the border with Afghanistan. The negotiations in North West Frontier Province are the latest attempt by Pakistan's civilian government -- which took power last year -- to achieve peace through diplomacy in areas where Taliban and al Qaeda leaders are believed to have free rein. But analysts as well as critics within the establishment have warned that Pakistan's previous dealings with the Taliban have only given the fundamentalist Islamic militia time to regroup and gain more ground. Khadim Hussain, a professor Bahria University in Islamabad who studies Pakistani politics, said the government has effectively surrendered the areas to the Taliban, thereby setting the stage for two contradictory, parallel states in North West Frontier Province. \"If you leave them like that and you give ... a semblance of peace in a particular area, what does that mean?\" Hussain said. \"It means you're capitulating. It means you're surrendering the state to them. It means your submitting the state authority to them because they are running a parallel state.\" He said the government's decision amounts to a marriage of convenience made under duress. Swat has been overrun by forces loyal to Maulana Fazlullah's banned hardline Islamic group, Tehreek Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi (TNSM) which has allied itself with Taliban fighters. TNSM was once led by Sufi Mohammed, Fazlullah's father-in-law who is leading the latest negotiations. Sufi Mohammed was released from jail last year by Pakistani authorities after he agreed to cooperate with the government. He was jailed in 2002 after recruiting thousands of fighters to battle U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Fazlullah took over TNSM during Sufi Mohammed's jail stint and vowed to continue his fight to impose fundamentalist Islamic law in the region. Last May, Pakistan's government announced it reached a peace deal with militants in Swat Valley. In the months that have followed, the Taliban have seized control of the region and carried out a violent campaign against government officials, including local politicians. The head of the Awami National Party -- which represents the region -- was forced to flee to Islamabad amid death threats from the Taliban. Pakistan is under enormous pressure to control the militants within its borders, blamed for launching attacks in neighboring Afghanistan where U.S. and NATO forces are fighting militants. The deal with the Taliban comes on the heels of a visit by U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke, who is now meeting with leaders in neighboring India. He said he is awaiting more details of Monday's agreement, but said it underlines the challenge of dealing with the rise of the Taliban. The United States -- using unmanned drones -- has carried out several airstrikes inside Pakistan on suspected militant targets, including one on Monday that killed at least 15 people, Pakistani sources said. Such airstrikes, which sometimes result in civilian casualties, have aggravated tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan. Pakistan's military operation in the region is unpopular among Pakistanis, but efforts to deal diplomatically with militants have not worked in the past. Pakistan's previous leader, Gen.

She is a slight girl of 11, living in a simple home in a suburb of Islamabad. But in Tuba's case, looks are deceiving. \"I want to give peace to my nation,\" Tuba Sahaab says, \"I will fight for it.\" With her pen, Tuba is taking on the swords of the Taliban. She crafts poems telling of the pain and suffering of children just like her; girls banned from school, their books burned, as the hard-core Islamic militants spread their reign of terror across parts of Pakistan. A stanza of one of her poems reads: \"Tiny drops of tears, their faces like angels, Washed with blood, they sleep forever with anger.\" Tuba is not afraid to express her views. Of the Taliban forcing young girls out of the classroom, she says: \"This is very shocking to hear that girls can't go to school, they are taking us back to the Stone Age.\" Less than two hours from Tuba's home, the Taliban have control. The one-time holiday destination of the Swat Valley is now a no-go zone. Curfews are in place at all times. Militants kill with impunity. Human rights activists and people on the ground in Swat Valley speak of a place called \"slaughter square\" where the Taliban leave the bodies of their victims with notes saying \"do not remove for 24 hours.\" No one touches the corpses out of fear of reprisals.

Back home, she tells me how she would give her life for her country. \"I want to give peace to my nation,\" she says, \"I will fight for it.\" And Tuba has an inspiration: U.S. President Barack Obama. She prayed for his elections, she says. She sees in him the hope of peace in her own country. Tuba Sahaab has a dream to meet her hero. She can hardly contain her excitement. \"I want to go the White Palace and show him my poems, show him what is happening and ask him to come to Pakistan and control it because he is a super power.\" Meeting and listening to Tuba Sahaab, it is easy to forget she is still a young girl. In her playground at school, Tuba dances and laughs with her friends. She loves writing her short stories (she has already published one book) and shows me a cartoon character she has created called \"Tomato Man.\" Tuba's parents are proud of their daughter. They say they are not afraid even as she speaks out so publicly against the Taliban. Tuba is their only child but as her mother tells me, she is \"worth more than seven sons and seven daughters.\" And Tuba has the dreams of any young child. She tells me she wants to be an astronaut and then one day lead her country. \"I will do anything, if my life goes I don't worry, I just want to do something.\" \"I think you will get the chance,\" I say. \"Yes, if someone gives me the chance you will see what I can do.\" Of that, I have no doubt.", "0e400a3087db0f5a9ae1788bf1246f4fced51f84": "DETROIT, Michigan (CNN) -- It's 7 a.m. at Henry Ford Hospital, and surgeons are preparing to remove a cancerous tumor from a man's kidney. A doctor posts updates on social-networking site Twitter during a recent operation in Detroit. It's potentially a risky surgery, but everything's ready: The doctors and nurses are in the operating room, the surgical instruments are sterilized and ready to go, and the chief resident is furiously Twittering on his laptop. That's right -- last week, for the second known time, surgeons Twittered a surgery by using social-networking site Twitter to give short real-time updates about the procedure. Following the February 9 operation online were other doctors, medical students and the merely curious.  Watch surgeons Twittering from the operating room \u00bb . \"Here's something different: HenryFordNews is live tweeting surgery today, getting some buzz, too,\" wrote one Twitter participant from Massachusetts. \"I find this fascinating!\" tweeted another Twitter user from Swansea, United Kingdom. \"It's an interesting use of technology, but I can't help but feel a bit 'eeewww!' about this,\" wrote a third tweeter from New York. Why twitter a surgery? Whether it's new and cool or merely yicky, observers say there's no question that more and more doctors -- and patients -- will be sharing the blow-by-blow of medical procedures on sites like Twitter and Facebook. Dr. Craig Rogers, the lead surgeon in the Henry Ford surgery, said the impetus for his Twittering was to let people know that a tumor can be removed without taking the entire kidney. \"We're trying to use this as a way to get the word out,\" Rogers said. Observers say Twittering about a procedure is a natural outgrowth of the social networking media revolution. \"Doing this removes a real communication barrier. It helps make something scary much more comprehendable,\" said Christopher Parks, co-founder of the Web site changehealthcare.com. \"It brings us closer together and makes us more engaged.\" Four months ago, Park's colleague, Robert Hendrick, tweeted his own varicose vein removal surgery here as it was happening (he was, obviously, under local anesthesia). \"It redirected my attention and allowed me to minimize some of the nervousness around what was going on. It felt like I had family and friends there to support me,\" Hendrick wrote in an e-mail. \"I wanted a record for other people who might be interested in the same surgery,\" added Hendrick, who also posted photos and video of his surgery. \"It later allowed me to connect with others with the same issues.\" As time goes by and the younger generation moves into medicine, expect even more sharing online of private medical procedures, Parks says. \"Newer and newer generations are used to putting their life online,\" he said. \"This generation shares everything.\" \"Gosh, this is big\" Twitter users -- those \"tweeple\" -- who kept up with the Henry Ford procedure online got to share some medical drama in real time. (You can read the \"Tweetstream\" or watch video of the tumor removal on YouTube). As Rogers got closer to the tumor, he realized it was far larger than it had appeared on a CT scan, and he wondered out loud whether he would have to remove the entire kidney -- something he'd been trying to avoid. \"Gosh, this is big,\" he said to his colleagues in the operating room. \"Could I have picked a harder case for this?\" As Rogers worked away on his robotic machinery, the chief resident, Dr. Raj Laungani, Twittered: \"Dr. Rogers is saying because the tumor is so large he may have to do a radical (total) nephrectomy.\" After conferring with Laungani and others in the operating room, Rogers decided he could remove just part of the kidney. Then came another challenge: In a surgery like this one, doctors have to restrict blood flow to the kidney with clamps while they remove the tumor. Those clamps then have to be removed within 30 minutes so the kidney isn't damaged by the lack of blood. iReport.com: Would you allow your surgeon to \"tweet\"? \"The goal is to keep the clamp time below 30 minutes,\" Laungani Twittered. \"25 minutes left!!!\" Approximately 25 minutes later, Laungani shared his relief with all of Twitterville: \"Tumor is excised, bleeding is controlled, we are about to come off clamp,\" he wrote. In the end, Rogers had the last tweet. \"The robotic partial nephrectomy was a success,\" he wrote. \"Thank you for joining us today.\" CNN's Jennifer Pifer-Bixler and Marcy Heard contributed to this article.", "688b08ca48de0ae9be1541955f7280c5547cc753": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Australian pop star Kylie Minogue and the professor who created Dolly the sheep are among the prominent figures who have received awards from Queen Elizabeth II in her annual New Year Honors list.

Sienna Miller and favorite hairstylist Adir Abergel: \"If I worried what people thought about my look, I'd get it all wrong.\" Sienna Miller and hairstylist Adir Abergel . Try to talk coifs with Sienna Miller and she'll cut you off at the pass. \"I don't even own a hairbrush!\" she insists. \"I'm really not too attached to my hair.\" No kidding. She gamely lopped off about 10 inches to play Edie Sedgwick in Factory Girl. But the actress is much less keen to part with her hairstylist Adir Abergel, for whom she has been known to cook dinner at her London home. \"Adir gets me,\" says Miller. \"He knows I never like to look too done or polished.\" Her biggest challenge? \"I've got quite a lot of hair, but I like it flat, so Adir squashes it down for me.\" To create Miller's ideal look, Abergel flatirons her roots and combats bulkiness with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fekkai Coiff Finishing cream. \"Sienna feels most like herself when her hair is soft and airy versus set and stylized,\" he says. Still, it takes effort to appear this artfully undone. It may seem like she rolls out of bed looking glamorous, but Miller says it is not that easy: \"I'm very much involved in how I want to look.\" Eve and makeup artist JJ Jacobucci . She dyed her hair platinum as a Philadelphia teenager, rose to fame as a hip-hop biker chick, and cavorted with a tiger -- and later Gwen Stefani -- on MTV. It seems like Eve was born edgy. But until recently the rapper-singer-actress clung religiously to her signature look of cat eyes, dewy skin and pale pink lips, aided by the habitual application of MAC Lipglass in Malibu Barbie (she's also a company spokeswoman). It was on the L.A. set of Eve's candy-colored video for \"Tambourine\" (the hit single off her fall album Here I Am) that makeup artist JJ Jacobucci motivated the star to test a new image. \"JJ recently said to me, 'Thank you for letting me experiment,'\" says Eve, referring to a Cyndi Lauper--inspired look that involved electric-blue eye shadow. \"I have definitely opened up a lot more.\" Says Jacobucci: \"We were so used to seeing her in nude lips, bronze skin and comfortable colors. I push Eve to get out of that box.\" The star has lately sported hot-pink lips, chartreuse highlighter on her browbones, and blue mascara with newfound confidence. \"At first Eve was like, 'Oh my god,'\" says Jacobucci of such intense shades. \"I was like, 'Listen, trust me. I'm going to make you look gorgeous.'\" Kate Bosworth and hairstylist Renato Campora . During the last three years, hairstylist Renato Campora has seen all shades of actress Kate Bosworth. \"When I met her, she had beachy [sandy] highlights,\" says Campora, who brightened up Bosworth's Blue Crush--era color so she looked \"more movie star, like a young Marlene Dietrich.\" Campora's platinum touch sent his number straight to Bosworth's speed dial. \"It's a little secret,\" she says of his closet coloring abilities (he's known primarily as a haircutter). \"I call him months in advance!\" Naturally, she also uses him as her stylist -- it was Campora who gave her the sleek bob that solidified her status as a hair icon last year. \"She was the first one to have it,\" he says. \"And then everybody did the bob. She was the inspiration.\" For someone whose biggest struggle is building volume (Bosworth has \"baby angel hair,\" says Campora) the bob was perfect; her hair looked thicker, and it practically styled itself. \"I could jump out of the shower, give it a tousle and leave,\" says Bosworth. Her next experiment? \"I want to be a redhead -- a deep, Karen Elson redhead. Just to go there once.\" Hilary Duff and makeup artist Rachel Goodwin . When Hilary Duff first settled into Rachel Goodwin's makeup chair in 2004, she felt like she had found a soul mate. \"It was really instant,\" says Duff, who fell head over heels for the Chanel artist's ability to create high cheekbones, luxe lashes and pale lips. But never mind the makeovers for movie premi\u00e8res and music videos for her latest album, Dignity; for Goodwin, the real test was meeting Duff's family. \"My mom [Susan] did makeup for Neiman Marcus, so she knows what looks good and what doesn't,\" says Duff. Luckily, Goodwin wowed the 'rents. \"That's when I knew it was OK -- when Susan was like, 'This is good work,'\" laughs Goodwin, who now pushes the boundaries with blue shadows and white eyeliner. \"I have really big eyes,\" says Duff, \"and for the longest time I would use black eyeliner to make them look smaller. Rachel actually made them look bigger by lining them with white. I love how she makes me see myself differently.\" Now when the two get together, they share more than makeup tricks. \"We see each other a couple of times a week for hours,\" says Duff. \"We talk about boys, life and work. We know each other so well. It's like a big therapy session every time.\" Rachel Weisz and hairstylist Mark Townsend . She may be an Oscar winner, but Rachel Weisz has little in common with her gilded statuette. \"In real life I'm very unpolished,\" says the mother of 17-month-old Henry. \"Dressing for the red carpet is fantasy time, but in my day-to-day life, I'm very grungy.\" This low-maintenance attitude has served her hair well. \"It's in great shape,\" says Matrix hairstylist Mark Townsend. \"Rachel's hair matches her personality: It's not overdone, not super-fussed-over. And she's incredibly approachable and sweet.\" Fearless too: In 2005 the British actress sheared her locks to a half inch to play a dying woman in The Fountain. While growing out her hair, she often donned extensions. But a year later, when Townsend suggested she wear a thicket of curly, waist-length tresses to the Oscars, the eight-months-pregnant star didn't feel so brave. \"Are you sure we need this much hair?\" Weisz asked. But Townsend soldiered on, confident in his vision. \"I wanted fullness in the back to balance out her silhouette,\" he says of the baby bump/hair bump symmetry. The romantic updo proved lucky -- and prophetic. \"Now I'm growing my hair out,\" she says. \"I've come to like it really long and unruly.\" E-mail to a friend .

Triumphant: Edwin van der Sar holds the British goalkeeping record for most time without conceding. The Dutch veteran also took the 30-year-old English record from Steve Death last week. Death's name, with all due respect to the former Reading custodian, is not up there with the game's greats. So who is in Van der Sar's league as football's finest shot-stoppers, the men who rarely get the credit but often cop the flak? Here, Football Fanzone presents a run down of the best goalkeepers in history. Read through our picks and tell us if you disagree or if we've missed anyone in the Sound Off box below. What do you think of van der Sar's inclusion? Lev Yashin (USSR) Yahsin is the only goalkeeper ever to be named European Footballer of the Year, in 1963. Dubbed the Black Spider for his all-black outfit and what seemed like eight limbs, the Russian even invented the concept of the keeper as sweeper. In the days when keepers were not protected by referees as they are today, Yashin's bravery and acrobatics were legendary and 207 clean sheets and 150 penalties saves he made in a 22-year career tell their own story. The best keeper at each World Cup is presented with the Yashin Award. Dino Zoff (Italy) Zoff is one of just two goalkeepers to lift the World Cup having captained Italy to their third crown in 1982. He was already 40 then, making him the oldest World Cup-winning captain too. But the unflappable Zoff's achievements don't end there: he holds the record for the longest playing time without conceding in international tournaments (1,142 minutes) set between 1972 and 1974. And with 112 caps, he ranks third in the Azzurri's all-time list. A true great. Gordon Banks (England) \"What a save,\" so the commentary runs to the finest piece of goalkeeping ever and one of football's most memorable moments. Pele was certain he'd scored after meeting Jairzinho's center, heading powerfully down into the left-hand corner of the net in Brazil's 1-0 1970 World Cup group win over England. But somehow Banks scrambled across, miraculously diving to push the ball up over the bar. Banks might have been immortalized by that stop, but his absence through illness from England's subsequent quarter-final against West Germany was perhaps more telling when his replacement Peter Bonetti was made a scapegoat for the defending champions' defeat. Peter Schmeichel (Denmark) Schmeichel will go down as Sir Alex Ferguson's best signing for Manchester United, certainly pound-for-pound. Bought for just $750,000 in 1991, the imposing Schmeichel would provide United everything a world-class goalkeeper requires -- including the ability to launch a swift counter-attack. He won Euro 92 with Denmark and the Treble with United in 1999, while 13 career goals are not to be sniffed at either. He played on a season too long, maybe, but on his day there were few better. Edwin van der Sar (Holland) At 38, the rangy Van der Sar is in the very twilight of his career -- but what a career it's been. The man from Voorhout holds the record number of caps for Holland, he's won the Champions League twice and is on course to win a third Premier League title in a row with Manchester United this season. All of which makes you wonder how come he spent so long at Fulham? United fans would love to have had Van der Sar way before 2005; he has proved to be the definitive Schmeichel replacement. Iker Casillas (Spain) It's easy to take Casillas' brilliance for granted, but stand back and look at his career and it's clear he's already one of the greats. Real Madrid have always been able to lure the best, yet they've had the agile Casillas as their number-one No.1 since 1999 -- when he was still a teenager. Still only 27, Casillas is contracted to the club until 2017. He's already won two Champions Leagues and four La Liga titles. At international level he came into his own during 2008 by captaining Spain to the European Championship, becoming the first goalkeeper to do so. Ricardo Zamora's legacy is safe hands. Pat Jennings (Northern Ireland) Jennings was a late starter in the position and famously had no official coaching. His international career spanned a record-breaking six World Cups (including qualifying campaigns) across 22 years. By the time he came out of retirement to play for Northern Ireland at Mexico 1986, Jennings was 41 and ended the tournament with 119 caps. He played more than 1,000 games, including crossing the bitter north London divide by playing for Tottenham and Arsenal. The unflappable Jennings' enormous hands were his trademark and the curse of many an attacker. Gianluigi Buffon (Italy) Buffon vies with Casillas and the Czech Republic's Petr Cech to be considered the best goalkeeper around at the moment, but in a country with a long tradition of high-quality No.1s Buffon is up there with the very best. Winning the 2006 Yashin Award was the perfect riposte to his critics after Juventus' dramatic fall from grace owing to match-fixing. Buffon, an imposing figure with no obvious weaknesses, stayed loyal to the Old Lady, who made him the world's most expensive goalkeeper in 2001 when they paid Parma $46.2m for him. He's been worth every cent. Jose Luis Chilavert (Paraguay) If there's one thing a goalkeeper is not expected to do -- other than to make a mistake -- it's score a goal. Given Chilavert netted no fewer than 62 times in his career, including eight for his country, it seems only fair he should be included on this list. Brazil's Rogerio Ceni may have outscored him and Rene Higuita of Colombia might have out-done him on the chutzpah front, but Chilavert's pioneering free-kicks and penalties have made him a legend. Mohamed Al-Deayea (Saudi Arabia) Goalkeepers are known for their longevity and ability to perform into their 40s. That makes Al-Deayea a relative youngster at just 36, but the Saudi Arabian holds the world record for the most number of international appearances. Over a 16-year career for the Middle Eastern country, Al-Deayea racked up a scarcely believable 181 caps.. Having started his career playing handball, Al-Deayea went on to play in three World Cups -- and was even on the receiving end of an 8-0 thumping by eventual finalists Germany at the 2002 tournament. Guillermo Ochoa (Mexico) This one is from the left-field and a little premature for a list containing the best goalkeepers of all time. But much is expected of Ochoa, Mexico's up-and-coming talent. He's already been linked with a move to Manchester United and he is on the radar of a number of Europe's top clubs. Reliant on his amazing reflexes, Ochoa is one of the best shot-stoppers out there and great at on-the-spot improvised saves. Ochoa's already established in the Mexico set-up and is already such a big star already that the American release of the FIFA 09 video game featured him on the front cover. Definitely one to watch.", "8027c0d60791c73bf0d800598b8aad8091523f9a": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States has designated a Kurdish militant group in Turkey as a terrorist organization, the State Department said.

The United States says TAK is \"responsible for multiple terrorist attacks in Turkey, which targeted tourist locations, military sites, and government buildings, resulting in several deaths.\" The classification of the group as a \"Specially Designated Global Terrorist\"  subjects the organization and its supporters to financial sanctions. \"With this designation, the United States reaffirms its commitment to fight terrorism in cooperation with its NATO ally, Turkey. The United States will continue to work with Turkey, Iraq, and the rest of Europe against the PKK and its support networks and affiliates, such as the TAK. There must be no safe havens for such terrorists,\" according to a statement from Tom Casey, deputy spokesman of the State Department. The move came after President Bush met Tuesday in Washington with Turkish President Abdullah Gul. The men discussed what Bush called their \"common enemy ... the PKK.\" The PKK has spent two decades fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey.

South African captain Graeme Smith led from the front with 75 as his team wrapped up victory. Captain Graeme Smith hit a fluent 75 as his side successfully passed a modest victory target of 183 on the final day at the MCG to take an unassailable 2-0 lead. It was the South African's first-ever Test series triumph in Australia and victory in the third and final match in Sydney will see them leapfrog the home side at the top of the global rankings. Hashim Amla (30 not out) scored the winning runs shortly after lunch as South Africa became the first team to overcome Australia at home since the West Indies in 1992-93. South Africa were never under any pressure in their run chase and did not lose a wicket until just before lunch when the inspirational Smith was trapped leg before wicket by Nathan Hauritz. Smith had dominated a 121-run opening stand with Neil McKenzie, hitting 10 boundaries. McKenzie struggled to a half century and survived strong lbw shouts from Brett Lee, who was bowling despite an injured foot that will keep him out of the Sydney Test. South Africa's victory was set up by a brilliant maiden Test century from JP Duminy, who shared a stunning 180-run ninth wicket partnership with pace bowler Dale Steyn. It gave the tourists a priceless 65-run lead on first innings before man of the match Steyn worked his magic with the ball as Australia were bowled out on the fourth day for 247 in their second innings. The pugnacious Smith was virtually lost for words in his victory speech. \"It has been such a special moment for all of us, it has been an incredible team effort,\" he said. \"I have been smiling non-stop since we hit the winning runs. \"To be 2-0 up after this game was something we only dreamt of.\" South Africa won the first Test in Perth from an unlikely position, chasing 414 for victory for the loss of only four wickets.", "c26dba391aea18166902e590edff05db2580ee27": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- A leader of the Sons of Iraq anti-al Qaeda group was killed Saturday when a bomb attached to his vehicle exploded, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said.

The eight men deny conspiracy to murder by plotting to blow up transatlantic aircraft. Prosecutors told London's Woolwich Crown Court the men planned to make the explosives from household objects to resemble drinks bottles, batteries and other items to be carried onto aircraft in hand luggage, the UK's Press Association reported. The foiling of the alleged plot in August 2006 triggered the imposition of strict new security measures at international airports around the world, restricting the quantity of liquids passengers can carry on to aircraft. The measures, which led to massive delays and scores of canceled flights when they were imposed overnight, remain in place at many airports. Prosecutor Peter Wright described two of the men, Abdulla Ahmed Ali, 28, and Assad Sarwar, 28, as ringleaders of an Islamic fundamentalist conspiracy, according to PA. \"It was an interest that involved inflicting heavy casualties upon an unwitting civilian population all in the name of Islam,\" he said. \"These men were indifferent to the carnage that was likely to ensue if their plans were successful. To them the identities of their victims was an irrelevance by race, color, religion or creed. \"What these men intended to bring about together and with others was a violent and deadly statement of intent that would have a truly global impact.\" Wright said the bombs were to be carried onto flights to the United States by suicide bombers as part of a plot hatched in Britain and Pakistan, according to PA. He said a computer memory stick seized at the time of the defendants' arrests listed details of flights operated by three carriers -- American Airlines, United Airlines and Air Canada -- between August and October 2006. \"If each of these flights were successfully blown up the potential for loss of life was considerable,\" Wright said.

The November 2007 crash left a gash in the tanker's side and led to an oil spill that killed more than 2,000 birds. The National Transportation Safety Board said the pilot of the Hong Kong-registered Cosco Busan, was \"medically unfit\" on November 7, 2007. That, and a master pilot's poor oversight of his performance, were major factors in the crash that dumped 53,000 gallons of oil into the bay, the NTSB said. \"How a man who was taking a half-dozen impairing prescription medications got to stand on the bridge of a 68,000-ton ship and give directions to guide the vessel through a foggy bay and under a busy highway bridge is very troubling,\" said acting NTSB Chairman Mark V. Rosenker. The pilot, John Cota, was charged with criminal negligence in federal court last year. He faces two misdemeanor charges that could result in up to 18 months in prison and $115,000 in fines. The 901-foot ship left Oakland, California, en route to South Korea when Cota gave orders that steered the ship directly toward a support tower on the bridge. While the ship avoided a direct hit, it hit a support system at the tower's base, cutting a 212-foot gash in the ship's side, the NTSB said. The board ruled that Cota and Chinese master pilot Mao Cai Sun never thoroughly discussed a plan before they took off on a foggy night when visibility was less than a quarter-mile. The oil spill killed about 2,500 birds of 50 different species, according to the report. The crash caused more than $70 million in environmental cleanup costs, $2 million in damage to the ship and $1.5 million in damage to the bridge. The report also blamed the ship's operator, Fleet Management Ltd., for not properly training crew members and the U.S. Coast Guard for not providing adequate medical oversight of the pilot. It said the Coast Guard should have revoked the pilot's license, the pilot should have given a meaningful pre-departure briefing about plans for the voyage and the master pilot should have taken a more active role in ensuring the ship's safety. \"There was a lack of competence in so many areas that this accident seemed almost inevitable,\" Rosenker said.", "46bed153c1ba79ff212ca7108c9a71e20ea190ec": "(CNN)  -- Rwandan troops have crossed into the Democratic Republic of Congo to prepare for a joint operation with Congolese forces against a Hutu militia, the United Nations said. At least 800,000 people are thought to have died during 100 days of violence in Rwanda in 1994. \"We can tell you there are Rwandan soldiers here, but I cannot confirm the numbers,\" said Madnodje Mounoubai, spokesman for the U.N. mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Rwandans will team up \"with the Congolese forces,\" he said Wednesday. \"The Rwandan forces are in a meeting with Congolese forces and the understanding is that in the meeting they are preparing a joint operation against the FDLR,\" or the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda. The Rwanda News Agency reported that Rwanda has dispatched 1,917 soldiers. Rwanda and Congo traditionally have been on different sides of the conflict in eastern Congo. The struggle pits ethnic Tutsis, supported by Rwanda, against ethnic Hutu, backed by Congo. The conflict is effectively an extension of the Rwandan genocide dating back to the early 1990s, when hundreds of thousands of Rwandans were killed in ethnic battles between minority Tutsi and majority Hutu. According to a statement issued last week by the Rwandan government, the joint military operation is aimed at driving out the FDLR and former members of the Interhamwe militia, \"remnants of those who spearheaded the 1994 genocide against Tutsis.\" Michael Arunga, a Kenya-based spokesman for the World Vision aid organization, said his colleagues in Goma -- a city in eastern Congo -- told him that Rwandan troops arrived Tuesday morning in the village of Ishsha, outside of Goma. Arunga said he had no knowledge of Rwandan troops being in Congo before. A U.N. statement said the FDLR has been involved in clashes since late August mainly in North Kivu, \"where the national army, the mainly Tutsi militia -- known as the CNDP -- and other rebel groups ... have fought in shifting alliances, uprooting around 250,000 civilians on top of the 800,000 already displaced by violence in recent years.\"  See photos from Mia Farrow's trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo \u00bb .

Grasping tissues and moaning, Bobby Cutts Jr. testitfied he never meant to hurt girlfriend Jessie Davis. The jury of six men and six women reached the verdict after more than 21 hours of deliberations. Jurors found Cutts guilty of aggravated murder for the unlawful termination of Davis' pregnancy and the aggravated murder of a child under the age of 13. But the jury found him guilty of a lesser murder count in the death of Davis. Davis was nine months pregnant when she disappeared.  She had chosen the name Chloe for her daughter. Jurors found that baby Chloe was killed during the commission of another crime, making Cutts eligible for the death penalty. The penalty phase of the trial is set to begin February 25. Cutts will face a sentence of either 25 years to life with the possibility of parole, 30 years to life with the possibility of parole, life without parole or death. As the verdicts were read, Cutts remained stoic, a stark contrast to his tearful testimony on Monday.  Watch the verdicts \u00bb . His and Davis' families left  the courthouse without comment. Jurors began deliberations late Tuesday afternoon. They had been sequestered, spending nights at a nearby hotel, cut off from exposure to the media and other potential influences. According to testimony, Cutts, 30, rolled Davis' body in a comforter and dumped it in a park, leaving their 2\u00bd-year-old son, Blake, alone. Cutts also was found guilty of aggravated burglary, two counts of gross abuse of a corpse and endangering a child, Blake. Cutts sobbed on the witness stand as he admitted killing Davis and their unborn child. But Cutts insisted that their deaths were an accident. \"I didn't mean to hurt her,\" Cutts testified, clasping a handful of tissues. \"This isn't real,\" he said he kept telling himself. Prosecutors discounted Cutts' story, claiming he buckled under the financial pressure of child support, killed the mother of his child and then created a cover story to try to get away with it. On the stand, Cutts said he went to pick up his son Blake and became agitated when Davis, 26, wasn't moving fast enough to get the boy ready. He said he tried to leave her house but she grabbed him to keep him from leaving, and he accidentally elbowed her in the throat. Cutts told the jury he performed CPR on Davis and then tried to revive her with bleach. When he realized Davis was dead, Cutts said he panicked and put her in the back of his truck, so Blake wouldn't have to see his mother. Myisha Ferrell, Cutts' longtime friend, testified for the prosecution that Cutts appeared at her home at 6 a.m. after Davis died. She said she could tell he was distraught. When they left her home in his truck, she found out why. \"We drove off and he said something was wrong,\" she said. \"He said, 'Something bad.' \" \"He said something was wrong with his baby's mother.\" Ferrell told the jury Cutts started speaking erratically as they drove, then blurted out, \"She's in the back.\" Ferrell admitted she helped dump Davis' body in a field and said Cutts later coached her on what to say to police. Ferrell was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to lying to authorities and complicity to gross abuse of a corpse. During closing arguments, prosecutor Dennis Barr said Cutts strangled and killed Davis and her unborn child because of his mounting debt and child support for what would have been his fourth child. Cutts' own actions following Davis' disappearance were a clear indications of his guilt, he said. \"His reaction is the reaction of person who committed a crime and is trying to cover it up,\" Barr said. Davis disappeared in June and the search for her attracted national attention. At that time, Cutts repeatedly denied he had any involvement. But Cutts eventually led police to her body. \"For nine days he kept the location of [Davis' body] a secret and went on about his life, every day knowing that Jessie and Chloe were laying there rotting away, destroying the evidence,\" Barr said. Prosecutors also reminded the jury of the testimony of one of Cutts' friends, Richard Mitchell, who claimed the former police officer threatened to kill Davis one month before she disappeared. \"I'm going to kill that [expletive] and throw her in the woods,\" Mitchell quoted Cutts as saying. In their closings, Cutts' attorneys acknowledged their client's poor judgment after Davis' death, but said the prosecution had not presented any witnesses to support their claim that Cutts was in financial distress. They urged the jury to find Cutts not guilty on the basis that the prosecution did not prove their case that he intentionally killed Davis. Fernando Mack, a defense lawyer, admitted Cutts' judgment lapsed when he wrapped Davis' body up and went to dispose of it, leaving their toddler alone with the bleach-soaked rug. But he cautioned jurors against deciding Cutts' fate based on an emotional response to ugly facts. \"Will it outrage you? Absolutely. But, Blake being left home alone doesn't tell you about aggravated murder.\" \"You don't know what happened in that house,\" defense attorney Carolyn Ranke said.

Trees in undisturbed tropical forests are soaking up more CO2 than people realized. The scientific report published in \"Nature\" magazine suggests that the world's remaining tropical forests remove 4.8 billion tons of CO2 emissions from the atmosphere each year. This includes a previously unknown carbon sink in Africa, which annually absorbs 1.2 billion tons of CO2. The study was based on taken data on African tropical forests from the past 40 years and has shown that for at least the past few decades each hectare of intact African forest has trapped an extra 0.6 tonnes of carbon per year. The scientists then analyzed the new African data together with South American and Asian findings to assess the total sink in tropical forests. Analysis of these 250,000 tree records reveals that, on average, remaining undisturbed forests are trapping carbon, showing that they are a globally significant carbon sink. \"We are receiving a free subsidy from nature,\" said Dr. Simon Lewis from the University of Leeds, and the lead author of the paper, in a press statement. \"Tropical forest trees are absorbing about 18 percent of the CO2 added to the atmosphere each year from burning fossil fuels, substantially buffering the rate of climate change.\" The study also found that trees of comparable age are gaining girth, though the reasons are unclear. For example, a 20-year-old tree is on average bigger than a 20-year-old tree measured a decade ago. A leading suspect is the extra CO2 in the atmosphere, which may act as a fertilizer.. However, Lewis warns, \"Whatever the cause, we cannot rely on this sink forever. Even if we preserve all remaining tropical forest, these trees will not continue getting bigger indefinitely.\" The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports that each year human activity emits 32 billion tons of CO2, but only 15 billion tons actually remain in the atmosphere adding to climate change. The new research suggests just where some of the \"missing\" 17 billion tons per year is going. \"It's well known that about half of the 'missing' carbon is being dissolved in to the oceans, and that the other half is going somewhere on land in vegetation and soils, but we were not sure precisely where. According to our study about half the total carbon 'land sink' is in tropical forest trees,\" Lewis said. The protection of tropical forests is likely to become a key theme at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in November in Copenhagen, Denmark. Co-author on the study, Dr. Lee White, Gabon's chief climate change scientist said, \"To get an idea of the value of the sink, the removal of nearly 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by intact tropical forests, based on realistic prices for a ton of carbon, should be valued at around \u00a313 billion ($18.5 billion) per year. This is a compelling argument for conserving tropical forests.\" Dr. Lewis added, \"Predominantly rich polluting countries should be transferring substantial resources to countries with tropical forests to reduce deforestation rates and promote alternative development pathways.\"", "7e151fdc3154f53dbdc846c8296350e8bc5ce1fa": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- All 18 people aboard a helicopter that crashed off the coast of Scotland have been recovered alive, a Royal Air Force officer told CNN.

But seemingly everyone has had difficulty calling or hailing a cab at some stage, on vacation or a business trip or when stranded in a city center after a night out. So what's the best, and quickest, way to get hold of a cab in New York? Or Los Angeles, California? Or at a major sporting event? We find out. Beware the bandit . Basil Enerieze, a taxi driver in Los Angeles, says in general a passenger's situation dictates the quickest way to get a cab. In downtown LA or in a commercial or tourist area, hailing a cab works best, he says, but calling one is the quickest way in suburban areas. Cabbies, he says, prefer fares that are called from a home or business as it gives the taxi company some information about the customer - their phone number, name and residence - in case the fare turns into trouble. Does this mean that taxis are more likely to respond to a call than being hailed? \"If they're there and need a ride I stop my cab,\" Enerieze says. \"The biggest problem we face is bandit cabs. Never take a bandit cab,\" he says. Enerieze says he's seen unlicensed operators in LA since he got his license 15 years ago, and that while they might in some cases be quicker or more available; the risks of hailing one are too great to justify. He says that licensed cabs will be clearly marked with a city insignia, and tells the tale of when he went to the theater in downtown Los Angeles and saw the long lines for a cab and decided, against his better judgment, to hail one of the many unlicensed cabs outside. On the 10-or-so mile drive to his home, he noticed the meter was running too fast. \"I said, 'I am a cab driver. I know that your meter is running too fast.' He [the driver] said: 'That's the way it is.\" And I paid the fare. [But because] it was an illegitimate taxi, I could not phone anyone to complain.\"AOL Autos: Cheapest family sedans . Bad apples in the big apple . Matthew Daus, the chairman of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, concurs, telling AOL: \"I think the number one, most important thing for anyone seeking taxicab or taxicab-like spontaneous service in New York City to understand is that only yellow, medallion taxicabs are legally empowered to solicit or accept street hails from the public. The driver of any other kind of vehicle that is soliciting passengers or responding to your taxi hail is already doing something illegal.\" AOL Autos: Cheapest luxury cars . He says that in adverse weather conditions or during peak demand hours, customers can be tempted to hop into something that looks like a legitimate limo or black car, but he, too, warns of the risks. \"TLC-licensed drivers are drug-tested and have had a criminal background check, and TLC licensed vehicles are inspected three times annually and carry insurance levels well in excess of the state's minimum requirements.\" AOL Autos: Best car deals this month . \"Taxicabs go where the people are. If you are hailing from the street, hail in the direction you are traveling to save turn-around time for both you and your driver. If you have the time to plan ahead, a call or Web site visit to a local livery service, black car or limousine service can quickly and conveniently arrange guaranteed door-to-door pick-up and drop-off. Look for the TLC diamond sticker inside the right-hand side of the windshield.\"AOL Autos: Best looking 2009 cars . Use your iPhone . Taxi Magic is the latest innovative application to come to your iPhone and allows a user to book a taxi at 25 of the nation's biggest cities - excluding New York - and track the progress of the driver en route, all by pressing the iPhone's touch screen a couple times. Helpfully, while saving you time talking to an operator it also cuts down on the number of calls the operator has to field, speeding up the service for others. The app, which pinpoints your location with GPS and calculates the nearest cab firms, was released by Web site ridecharge.com, which also features online booking and other goodies like taxi expense and receipt tracking and, in partnership with some companies, payment and account options that are always useful on vacation or business trips.

Late at night sometimes you get the feeling that all the cabs that drive past because cabs haven't seen you, something Stamford, Connecticut. company TaxiLite wants to remedy with its line of pocket-sized bright yellow LED light, which it says can be seen up to three city blocks away. The company says it increases your visibility in crowds and its light can be seen in rain, sleet or snow. In a release last week, TaxiLite President, Howard Lippin, said: \"TaxiLite has been very well received by cab drivers in New York City. Drivers have told me that TaxiLite will be a great help to them, especially in identifying fares at night and in bad weather.\" In the dark and when it's dry, you can also try holding up an iPhone with Exact Magic Software's ingenious flashlight application, which can create a strobe-light effect to catch a driver's attention, and a couple other Apple applications also will let you spell out TAXI in flashing billboard-effect lettering. Sporting events . Larry Meister, manager at the Independent Taxi Operators Association, which represents 350 Boston cabbies, says location is key to quickly getting a cab. He lends no credence to the rumor that patrons carrying luggage tend to get picked up quicker as cabbies know a tip is more likely at Logan International Airport (and usually drivers will go out of their way to earn it by taking the frequently heavy bags from the trunk to the curb). Boston, he says, has hundreds of taxi stands around the city, mostly on main thoroughfares, and he says his organization and others are working to put electronic cab-tracking, wait time and fare calculators in place for a new generation of taxi customers. But how about catching a cab at Boston's famous sporting events, a Red Sox or Celtics game? He chuckled ruefully. \"You're talking about the worst time; you're competing against 20,000 other patrons for cabs at the same time. The cabs are out there on Brookline Avenue trying to serve the public, but it's tough. If you leave before the end of the game you might have a shot at getting a cab quicker.\"", "2b8faeb992798b4bd9df316c1c907e9e132e0b0d": "(CNN) -- Kyrgyzstan's president signed a bill Friday to close an air base that the U.S. military uses as a route for troops and supplies heading into Afghanistan, the president announced on his Web site. Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan serves as a U.S. supply route for troops and supplies into Afghanistan. The news came as two other central Asian nations -- Tajikistan and Uzbekistan -- reportedly agreed to let U.S. cargo pass through their countries on the way to Afghanistan. Such deals, if confirmed, could help fill the void left by the closing of the Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan. The Kyrgyz order became effective on Friday when President Kurmanbek Bakiyev reportedly signed legislation that the parliament in Bishkek backed on Thursday, the Pentagon said. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry on Friday officially notified the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek that a 180-day withdrawal process is under way. Embassy spokeswoman Michelle Yerkin told CNN the United States hopes to retain the base. Officials in Washington and Bishkek signed a deal three years ago allowing the United States to renew the arrangement annually through July 2011. \"We do remain in contact with the government of Kyrgyzstan,\" Yerkin said. \"The Manas Air Base continues to operate under existing agreements, as per the coalition's efforts in Afghanistan.\" U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Friday the United States will continue to work with Kyrgyzstan on keeping the base open.   Watch why Kyrgyzstan wants to close the base \u00bb . \"I continue to believe that this is not a closed issue and that there remains the potential at least to reopen this issue with the Kyrgyz and perhaps reach a new agreement,\" Gates said at a NATO meeting in Krakow, Poland. \"If we are unable to do that on reasonable terms then, as I have suggested, we are developing alternative methods to get resupply and people into Afghanistan.\" The Manas Air Base outside Bishkek is the only U.S. base in Central Asia and is a major resupply hub for the war in Afghanistan. Its closing could deal a significant blow to the U.S. military effort there, especially following President Barack Obama's announcement of additional troops to halt a resurgence of the country's former Taliban rulers. The United States pays $17.4 million a year to use Manas, a major logistical and refueling center that supports troops in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said. About 15,000 troops and 500 tons of cargo reportedly move through Manas monthly, it said. The air base currently employs more than 1,000 servicemen, 95 percent of whom are Americans, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. \"This is an important facility, it has been an important facility, but it's not irreplaceable and, if necessary, we will find other options,\" Whitman said.  How far is Manas from Afghanistan? View our map \u00bb . Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, two other Central Asian nations that border Afghanistan, have agreed to allow U.S. cargo to be transported to Afghanistan through their countries, the Russian news agency Interfax reported Friday. The agency said Rear Adm. Mark Harnitchek, U.S. transportation command director for strategy, policy, programs and logistics, held a meeting with Tajik Foreign Minister Kharokhon Zarifi, after which he said he had also secured Uzbekistan's consent. A Tajik government statement said only that the two sides discussed the issue, but a spokesman for the Tajik foreign ministry told CNN that \"practically all issues\" to allow U.S. cargo transit through the country have been resolved. If confirmed, success would still depend on how much access the United States would have to those countries for flights and cargo, and even then, it may not totally replace the capacity lost in Kyrgyzstan. U.S. General David Petraeus, who oversees the war in Afghanistan, was in Uzbekistan this week for talks on Afghanistan and other regional issues. A Pentagon spokesman told CNN that his discussions included the regional supply network into Afghanistan. The U.S. military leased a base in Uzbekistan after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. But after Uzbek troops were accused of killing at least 150 people during a demonstration in 2005, the autocratic government of President Islam Karimov came under criticism from Washington and severed most of its military ties with the United States.", "fc9cc9efab7f6588f46b527b3076241a9bcea672": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The U.S. military coalition in Iraq confirmed Tuesday that a business jet -- not a U.S. military aircraft -- was recently forced down in Iran due to an airspace violation. A Falcon business jet is shown in an undated file photo. \"The airplane is now being confirmed as a light transport plane with no Americans onboard,\" Multi-National Forces-Iraq said in a statement issued Tuesday. \"From what we have been seeing, it was a Falcon business jet. We have accounted for all our aircraft and none are missing.\" The U.S. coalition in Iraq had no information on who owned the aircraft, stressing that it was not a registered American plane. Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency initially reported that five American military officials were on board the U.S. aircraft. But other Iranian media reports -- quoting Iranian officials -- said the aircraft was Hungarian and no Americans were on the plane. Iranian officials told Iran's state-run Arabic language channel Al-Alam that the incident happened a week ago and that the plane was carrying humanitarian workers. Fars later changed its Farsi language report, citing other Iranian and Arab media as saying the plane was not an American aircraft . Fars also initially reported that aircraft, which it called a \"Falcon fighter,\" entered Iranian airspace at a low altitude from Turkey to avoid radar detection, despite repeated warnings by the Islamic Republic Air Force. It said the plane also carried three civilians. Washington is monitoring the reports, but White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said \"as far as we know (they are) totally bogus.\" U.S. National Security Council Spokesman Gordon Johndroe also said there is no indication that the reports are accurate. \"We're looking into the various and conflicting reports coming from the Iranian 'news' agencies, but do not have any information at this time that would lead us to believe they are correct,\" he said. Fars said the aircraft, which was en route to Afghanistan, was forced to land at an Iranian airport that it did not name. Fars reported that the eight people aboard were released \"after daylong interrogations\" that revealed the aircraft had \"unintentionally\" violated Iran's airspace. Fars said the aircraft was later allowed to continue on to Afghanistan. Two top U.S. military officials told CNN's Barbara Starr that no U.S. military aircraft has been forced down. The U.S. military has an F-16 Fighting Falcon, but it is a one-seat jet fighter aircraft that is used by the U.S. Air Force for air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. The Dassault Falcon is a European-made private passenger business jet that resembles a Lear jet. It can seat a crew of two and as many as 10 passengers. It's used for passenger transport, but also has military uses.

Nechirvan Barzani, Prime Minister of the Kurdish Regional Government, called the project \"a significant contribution to the Iraqi economy.\" Four hundred and sixty one million square feet have been officially assigned to \"Gas Cities LLC,\" a joint venture between Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum, both Sharjah-based companies, to establish a new venture: \"Kurdistan Gas City.\" Kurdistan Gas City will include industrial, residential and commercial buildings in an integrated city. The expected initial investment in basic infrastructure is estimated at $3 billion, with further foreign direct investment exceeding $40 billion during the operations phase. Work will start on the project, which is designed to promote private sector investment in a variety of gas-related industries, on September 21. Gas City is structured to hold over 20 varieties of world scale petrochemical and heavy manufacturing plants, and hundreds of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), served by state-of-the-art facilities. Mr Nechirvan Barzani, Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government, said: \"Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum have made a significant contribution to the Iraqi economy through their work in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq thus far, we are making significant progress in spurring on economic growth and creating opportunity for our people.\" Hamid Jafar, Executive Chairman of Dana Gas, explained the importance of this achievement saying: \"The Kurdistan Gas City is an enormous step forward in Dana Gas' strategy across the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia.\" The Kurdistan Gas City is projected to generate job opportunities for nearly 200,000 Iraqi citizens in infrastructure, industrial projects, support services and other business activities. This is not the first project for Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum in Iraq's Kurdistan Region, the two companies are committed to a service agreement signed in April 2007 with the Kurdistan Regional Government to build 180 kilometers of natural gas pipeline and two liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) plants, which are 80 percent complete. The project is on track and will start pumping 150 million cubic feet of gas per day in the coming weeks, rising to 300 million cubic feet by early 2009. Other companies from the UAE showed similar interest in Kurdistan Region \"Damac Properties\" one of the major private developers in the regions revealed on June 3 plans for a $16 billion residential, commercial and recreational project.", "7554bcdf4be93baf973eccf5a3423bd8b383ac72": "(CNN) -- Not only is Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi the first woman to hold a ministerial post in the United Arab Emirates, the first female minister of economy in the Gulf, and the first to start a Middle Eastern BB marketplace, but she's also the first minister - anywhere in the world - to launch her own perfume line. Member of Sharjah royal family and one of Forbes' 100 most powerful women, Sheikha Lubna took the post of minister for economy and planning of United Arab Emirates in 2004. Her background is in IT and before the government appointment worked at the Dubai Ports Authority where she gained the \"Distinguished Government Employee Award\" in 1999 for developing a documentation system that reduced cargo turnaround from one hour to ten minutes. In 2000, Sheikha Lubna founded Tejari, the first Middle Eastern business-to-business marketplace. As a result of Tejari (Arabic for commerce) 70 percent of Dubai's government purchases are made online, while only 30 percent of bureaucrats were web-literate before its launch. One of the cornerstones of Sheikha Lubna's work has been to allow for foreign ownership, so when John Defterios met up with her, he began by asking her about her upcoming strategy. Sheikha Lubna: We are looking with scrutiny at the companies a lot at the moment and we have several sectors. We will evaluate each sector, from the service side, finance, accounting. And any sector that we believe we need further development in terms of economic growth, then we will focus on that: on increasing the acquisition or the ownership of the foreign company. Defterios: If you look at the Middle East, specifically within this Gulf region, it's quite a radical change to open up specific sectors to majority foreign ownership. Is this society in the region ready for this move? Sheikha Lubna: Interestingly, the United Arab Emirates is host to 80 percent of its population coming from outside. We host 200 nationalities, so for us, the contribution to the economy has already started over 15 years ago with the existence of the expatriate community. So in many ways I think the openness is only a natural path: it's an organic path to continue the openness that exists. Foreign direct investment is not your own wealth. When you have your own wealth, you have a tendency to be complacent sometimes, because it's your money and you may not think you need to actually strengthen your infrastructure. However, if you look at foreign direct investment, it mandates you to be much more transparent, you have to be very diligent about your work, and it also creates new knowledge coming into the country and you can create more development through employment. Defterios: It's interesting, you read the front line of the DP World, P&O acquisition and the furor it created in the United States particularly within Congress. What are the lessons, not just from the UAE perspective, but the lessons learned from both sides during that whole process? Sheikha Lubna: First of all, I think it is important to understand, in this global world, there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere. Liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad. We've learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad. And we've seen this where the UAE invests in the Far East, Australia, Asia as well as in Europe and the United States. What's more important to understand is that if you're going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that I don't want to sell to this particular organization versus another, there are other places. Defterios: That's not a veiled message your saying, that's pretty forthright this comment. Sheikha Lubna: But it's a message to all of us. If today I lock up my investment opportunity here, money will not come to me, money will go somewhere else. When I have investment coming from abroad, it creates confidence in this country that 'I am a global image'. So when I say it, I am not directing this as a message to a particular country. I am saying all countries are equal when it comes to regulation, when it comes to responsibility, when it comes to strategy in terms of attracting foreign funds and wealth coming to the country. So that's really a lesson that's very very critical. Defterios: A number of firsts: the first to start a B2B marketplace; the first female minister within the country, an economy minister; and the first to launch a perfume range as well. What is it all about? Trailblazing, setting examples, being an entrepreneur? How would you describe what you're doing here? Sheikha Lubna: Everybody laughs about the perfume. One, I think the United Arab Emirates, since inception (it's not from today but from the founder late Sheikh Zayed) has always given equal opportunities for women. But it's up to us as women to decide what is it that we can push, and what it is that we can do and not do. In my personal belief you need a bridge, you need a door opener for women. And sometimes women do not want to take the risk. Sometimes they are shy of achieving what they should be achieving. I had the opportunity and I had the trust from the government and the community, so to me, it is setting the example internally for the young women, and men by the way. Be it in technology, or economy or e-commerce. Defterios: And the perfume line is the exclamation point? Sheikha Lubna: A young woman, actually a perfume creator, who sells exclusively to Saks Fifth Avenue in Dubai, decided to create a perfume with my name. So I had two mandates from her. One, I had to smell it, otherwise if it doesn't smell good I'm not going to take it as a name. So one, I had to actually agree to the scent of the perfume. And it's an Arabic perfume by the way. And second, my mandate was that I would only launch it with my name for her, if she gives 20 percent of its sales and revenue to the Friends of Cancer Patients.

Chester Arthur Stiles faces life imprisonment if convicted of videtaping a sexual assault on a child. Chester Arthur Stiles, 38, faces 22 felony counts in connection with the videotape, including lewdness with a child, sexual assault with a minor and attempted sexual assault with a minor. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Thursday is the third day of jury selection, said Michael Sommermeyer, spokesman for Clark County, Nevada, courts. Some 200 potential jurors were called, according to CNN affiliate KVBC. As of Thursday morning, only seven jurors had passed on to the next stage of selection, Sommermeyer said. Prosecutors hope to seat 15 jurors eventually, Sommermeyer told CNN, meaning they'll want a pool of about 35 to pick from in the final stage. Picking a jury in the case is challenging, according to KVBC, not only because of the media attention the case has drawn, but because of the crimes Stiles is accused of. A questionnaire given to potential jurors has one question addressing the videotape: \"As a juror, despite the graphic nature of the videotape, can you promise to remain fair and impartial and objectively evaluate all evidence for returning a verdict?\" \"One, you let them know what the case involves and they've heard it on the news, it's a little difficult to get over any preconceived notions that they had about the case,\" defense attorney Stacey Roundtree told KVBC. \"However, we do have faith in this community that they want to do the right thing,\" she said. \"Most of the jury trials I've had, the jurors go out of their way to make the right decision. They go out of their way to follow the judge's rules, and we're confident we can have that happen in this case.\" The tape was given to authorities in September 2007 by a man who said he had found it in the desert five months before. On it, police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted. After attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl's identity, authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl, and the case drew nationwide attention. She was found in October 2007. An attorney for her mother said she was 7 years old and safe and healthy. The rape occurred before the girl's third birthday while she was in the care of a baby sitter her mother had hired, he said. The mother did not know the girl had been victimized. After the girl was found, authorities asked CNN and other news organizations to stop showing her picture. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was arrested in a traffic stop in October 2007. Police said at the time they pulled Stiles' car over because it had no license plate and became suspicious when the driver displayed an expired California license with a photo that did not match his appearance. \"He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles,'\" said Henderson, Nevada, police Officer Mike Dye. \"'I'm the guy you're looking for.\" Stiles told police he was \"sick of running,\" Dye said. The mother of the girl shown on the tape, meanwhile, went on \"The Dr. Phil Show\" after Stiles' arrest, saying that while she was \"relieved,\" it would have been \"better if they found him dead.\" She said her daughter remembers nothing about the alleged assault. \"Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through,\" Nye County, Nevada, Sheriff Tony DeMeo said during the manhunt for Stiles. The man who turned the tape over to authorities, Darrin Tuck, faced criminal charges because of the delay in turning it over, during which authorities alleged he showed it to others. A judge gave Tuck a one-year suspended sentence and three years of probation in April after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct a public officer, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He initially had faced a felony count of possession of child pornography.", "8003a890632a3d401b30d4abaa542be27d595d12": "(CNN) -- In Focus: Sovereign Wealth Funds .

What are some rules you'd like to crush? The idea of not wearing brown and black together seems so dated. The other day I wore a black T-shirt, black Nobody jeans, a brown leopard-print belt by Dolce & Gabbana, and brown Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, and it looked awesome. Also the rule about not matching your makeup to your outfit. I do that onstage, matching red lipstick to a bright red jacket or neon-pink eye shadow to a pink jumpsuit. And I also love to mix prints. We've had the Meg, the Jennifer, and now people ask for the Rihanna at salons. Will you be switching it up again? The first time I heard people were asking for the Rihanna, it was really flattering and maybe a little strange. It caught me by surprise, but now I feel it's a very cool thing. I don't feel the pressure to change it up again at all. I like it, as they like it. Can you talk about your style obsessions and how your look has evolved over the years? It has evolved without my even noticing it. Lately I'm obsessed with Thierry Mugler... Grace Jones inspires me. She is the most iconic woman ever, in my eyes. She has extraordinary style and she's fearless. I love designer Martin Margiela; Kanye West told me about him. I also like Dsquared, Chlo\u00e9, Zac Posen... But you weren't always a fashion maven? Growing up in Barbados, you were a tomboy. I wore my brother's clothes, dresses with sneakers, or no shoes at all. I would always get into trouble with my mom. She would say things to scare me like, \"You're going to get cut!\" But I couldn't help it. I would climb trees, steal mangoes, catch birds--silly things that were fun to us at the time. My cousin and I were the only girls in the group. We would have to stand up for ourselves because the guys didn't want us around. You stood out in Barbados because of your light complexion. Do you remember having trouble fitting in at school? Definitely. It made me angry... For the first six years of school, I would go home traumatized. The harassment continued to my very last day of elementary school. High school was better. I read that your mom owns a boutique and your dad works at a garment factory -- it seems you have the Rihanna fashion line already partly sewn up. [Giggles] Well I am working on that right now. It takes a lot of effort, and I want to be involved with every step of the process. What do you do for kicks in L.A.? I don't go out much. I'm moving into a new four-bedroom home in Los Feliz that I'm excited about. Parts of it will be inspired by India. I love things like canopy beds, printed fabrics and Spanish touches. Then I can stay at home and cook West Indian dishes like callaloo [stewed greens]. But I do want a sports car--as soon as I get my license. Who knew you were so domestic. Wait a minute. You're such a rebel. In the video for \"Take a Bow,\" you drive a car. I have my Barbadian license, just not my American one. How will you celebrate your 21st birthday? Don't scare me! I have till February. I feel like I have so much more to accomplish before I'm 21. No party plans yet. Many showbiz types say, \"Don't ever read your own press,\" but you do, even the online stuff. What's the kookiest thing you've read about yourself? The Grammy thing -- that I brought Jay-Z on stage and Beyonc\u00e9 was upset, which is so ridiculous. Or the idea that I've had breast implants -- I don't even have much cleavage. It was just the dress! So yes, I read about myself and about everybody else in the gossip pages. It's comedy to me; I laugh about it. The tattoo behind your ear is a Pisces symbol -- two fish swimming head to tail in a circle--which represents life after death.

A deputy oversees an eviction in Lafayette, Colorado, last week. Seventy-three percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday say they're very or somewhat scared about the way things are going in the United States. That's six points higher than in an October poll. Nearly eight in 10 say things are going badly in the country, with just 21 percent suggesting that things are going well. The survey also says that three out of four Americans are angry about the way things are going in the country. But three out of four questioned say that things are going well for them personally. The poll was released a day before President Obama gives a prime-time address before a joint session of Congress. \"Americans always believe things are better in their own lives than in the rest of the country,\" said CNN polling director Keating Holland. \"But they are realists as well -- they recognize that bad times somewhere else in the U.S. may eventually come to affect them.

Assistant lab supervisor Trevor Valle discusses the teeth and lower jaw of Columbian mammoth fossil \"Zed.\" Now, at least 10,000 years later, visitors in Los Angeles can see the remains of \"Zed,\" a Columbian mammoth whose nearly intact skeleton is part of what is being described as a key find by paleontologists at Los Angeles' George C. Page Museum. Zed was discovered at a construction site in the heart of Los Angeles. An earth mover helping to build an underground parking garage near the L.A. County Museum of Art uncovered the mammoth's skull, according to project director Christopher Shaw. \"The skull was hit and shaved off ... by a scraper,\" Shaw told CNN Thursday. \"We don't know just how smashed up it is, but it's fairly intact because it's a huge jacket we put it around.\" The mammoth's fossil was found along with 16 other deposits at the site that paleontologists \"tree-boxed\" along with the surrounding dirt, creating 23 massive crates weighing between 5 and 53 tons that were then lifted out intact. Zed's remains were encased in a plaster jacket. The construction was being monitored by a consulting firm because the site is so close to the La Brea tar pits -- a site that has yielded between 3 million and 4 million fossilized bones. Construction on the parking garage began in 2006 but it took two more years for all the recovered materials to be handed over to researchers at the Page Museum, who began analyzing the various fossils in June, Shaw said. \"It's very exciting for us because each one of these ... could be different ages in the past 10,000 to 45,000 years,\" Shaw said. John Harris, the head curator of the Page Museum, publicly announced the finding of \"a whole new treasure trove of fossils\" on Wednesday. He described it as \"the most important discovery\" for the museum \"of the last 90 years.\" Shaw said the announcement was made to \"create interest\" in the museum's discovery. Among the most interesting items is likely to be Zed, who is believed to have died in his late 40s. Mammoths are thought to have had an average lifespan of about 60 years. Not all of Zed's remains have been cleaned off and analyzed. \"Right now we have opened the plaster jacket of four sections that were excavated, including vertebrae and ribs and pelvis, one tusk and the lower jaw,\" Shaw said. \"It will take another six to 12 months to open everything.\" Shaw said both of Zed's tusks were found intact, which is very rare. \"Previously, we've found mammoths but the tusk material was very poorly preserved,\" Shaw said. \"It's very exciting to us to have these two complete, beautifully preserved tusks.\" The excitement generated by Zed and the rest of the paleontological find could help boost the Page Museum's attendance and funding, which is key as many museums are seeing their attendance dry up during the recession. \"The cleaning of Zed can be viewed inside the museum inside the 'fishbowl' -- a windowed area -- as parts of his bones are being cleaned,\" Shaw said. \"So people come to see us and we've constructed small exhibits. It will attract a lot of people and that will help our funding situation.\" Researchers hope to have the entire skeleton on display by next year. Shaw said it is unique to have such a major fossil find in the heart of an urban center like Los Angeles. \"I've always said we're kind of spoiled here in Rancho La Brea,\" he said. \"It's not like going to the Gobi Desert where you can't take a shower for weeks.\" While the process of cleaning and analyzing the fossils is very intricate and time consuming, Shaw said it is a rare experience for researchers to come in to work and not know what they will discover that day. \"Every day we come to work, we're uncovering things that haven't seen the light of day for 40,000 years,\" he said. \"It's an exciting thing that we're doing just that.\"", "29ba104809ad68b1bbfcb6025ef595f481878185": "(CNN) -- Though they support some federal action to help their states recover from the recession, several Republican governors said Sunday they plan to turn down a portion of what's offered in the stimulus bill that President Obama signed last week. Gov. Haley Barbour said the stimulus bill would force Mississippi to raise taxes. \"If we were to take the unemployment reform package that they have, it would cause us to raise taxes on employment when the money runs out -- and the money will run out in a couple of years,\" Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. The Republican governors of Idaho, Alaska, Texas, South Carolina and Louisiana expressed similar concerns. But one of their colleagues, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, had a message for them Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\" When asked about broader complaints from lawmakers such as South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford about the stimulus package leading to more debt, Schwarzenegger responded, \"I am more than happy to take his money or [that of] any other governor in this country that doesn't want to take this money. I take it because I think California needs it.\" Schwarzenegger said he does not foresee a need for a tax hike in the future to sustain the unemployment provisions. In a separate interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Schwarzenegger said the complaints are \"partially\" right, but that using the money for now \"cannot hurt.\" And another governor, Michigan Democrat Jennifer Granholm, told CNN, \"We'll take it.\"  Watch how stimulus package could affect your paycheck \u00bb . \"South Carolina, I'll take your money. Louisiana, we'll take it,\" Granholm said in an interview recorded last week and broadcast Sunday on \"State of the Union.\" \"We got plenty of work here, plenty of jobs that we would like to create here,\" Granholm added as she discussed the struggling auto industry and job losses in her state. A leading Democrat, meanwhile, said he does see a potential problem. \"I'm not sure that we can, over the long run, cope with the high unemployment compensation standard that this mandates for states,\" Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, the head of the National Governor's Association, told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"But I don't care. My people are suffering,\" he added. \"They need that extra money. And right now that's paramount in my mind.\" At issue is a portion of the unemployment assistance stipulated by the stimulus bill, which provides federal dollars to expand unemployment insurance in the states. In exchange for accepting that, states would have to expand the number of people who are given jobless benefits. In Louisiana, for example, that portion of the funds would total nearly $100 million, state officials said. Gov. Bobby Jindal, a rising GOP star, has announced plans to turn it down. \"The $100 million we turned down was temporary federal dollars that would require us to change our unemployment laws,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"That would have actually raised taxes on Louisiana businesses. We as a state would have been responsible for paying for those benefits after the federal money disappeared.\" The law demands a \"permanent\" change to state law, Jindal said. Jindal and the other governors do plan to accept other funds offered by the stimulus, including money to increase benefits for those who are receiving them. And even some governors who have expressed disappointment in the stimulus package are not shying away from any of the funding. \"I don't like this bill, but it is now the law. ... It's now our responsibility and opportunity to try to implement it,\" Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty told \"Fox News Sunday.\" Calling his state \"a major net subsidizer of the federal government,\" he said, \"We're paying the bill either way -- we're going to take our share of the money.\" In the end, some governors who would like to turn down a portion of the federal funding may not be able to. The law stipulates that state legislatures can overrule governors. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, said Americans are making it clear to all governors that they should accept whatever help they can get. \"Everywhere across the country, certainly in Massachusetts ... people want their roads repaired, they want their bridges repaired, they want a clean energy strategy ... and real alternatives, and they want us to be candid with them about those needs,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\"", "e404376f211534025dc5f3aeacd373408a99e866": "(CNN) -- Law enforcement officials arrested more than 500 people, and took custody of 48 juveniles in a coordinated 29-city weekend sweep aimed at combating child prostitution, the FBI announced Monday. Task forces made up largely of state and local police officers arrested and booked what authorities said were 464 adult prostitutes, 55 pimps and 55 customers on state charges. While most faced local charges, a senior FBI official said he expected there were would be some federal charges as well. The FBI Monday said 19 searches were conducted, netting a total of $438,000 in cash, plus illegal drugs, cars and computers.

In the previous coordinated operations, authorities recovered 21 alleged child prostitutes last June and 47 in October.

Once worthless Roman coins found in the British town of Snodland are considered quite a treasure. Cake or death? In order to stop rising inflation and devaluation of the currency in third century Rome, Emperor Diocletian instituted fixed prices on most consumer goods. Anyone selling goods at prices higher than those of the emperor was put to death; this led to hoarding of goods. A law was then passed that forbade the hoarding of goods. Penalty? Death. So people just closed their businesses, then another law was passed. You guessed it: shut down your business or fail to follow in your father's business? Death. It's amazing the Roman Empire lasted as long as it did. Mental Floss: Strange things we didn't know were illegal . Gonna barter like it's B.C. 99 . When the Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century, so did the Roman financial system. Part of the collapse was the disappearance of Roman coinage. Nowhere was this more evident than in England, where, according to archeological evidence, money basically disappeared, driving the British isles straight back to a barter economy. Coinage only came back centuries later when the English were forced to pay protection money (Danegeld) to the Vikings to stop the constant pillaging. 99.9 percent pure . In 15th century Germany, grain shortages -- acceptable -- frequently led to beer shortages -- unacceptable. In response, brewers in towns like Munich and Regensburg used seeds, spices, and rushes to flavor their beers. Showing an uncomfortable foreshadowing of future events, German authorities instituted purity laws stating that only water, barley, and hops could be used in the brewing of beer. The rule, or Reinheitsgebot, is still on the books today. Nothing but the best for France . While the Sun King, Louis XIV, and his building of Versailles typically get all the credit for bankrupting France in the seventeenth century, his Minister of Finance, Jean-Baptiste Colbert deserves some kudos as well. Colbert's tax schemes, deficit spending, and manic obsession with the production of luxury goods -- to the detriment, or outright exclusion of ordinary consumer goods -- emptied the French treasuries, drove the peasantry to starvation, and laid the foundation for the bloodiest revolution of the age. But, let's face it: who wouldn't trade the fate of an entire nation for a really, really well made tapestry? Adjustable rate mortgage, Archduke Ferdinand? In the 1860s, the rulers of the newly-formed Austro-Hungarian Empire encouraged their bankers to be more free with their lending standards. Their goal was to encourage growth in the empire. The result (this is going to sound eerily familiar) was over-speculation in building, massive default on borrowed funds, and economic collapse throughout Central Europe. The worldwide depression reached all the way to the United States and triggered the Panic of 1873. On the bright side, many of the most beautiful buildings in Europe come from this period of \"irrational exuberance.\" Mississippi burning . John Law, a Scottish banker and businessman, took control of a French enterprise called the Mississippi Company in 1717. In just a few years, he turned the company into the main economic force behind the French colonies throughout the world. The share price for the company went from about 500 livres in 1719 to 10,000 livres in 1720. Just one year later though, in a rather Enron-like turnaround, the stock price collapsed, Law fled France, and the French government (as the primary shareholder) was forced to cancel a significant portion of its debt obligations leaving lenders throughout the world ruined. Economists refer to the episode as the \"Mississippi Bubble.\" The Mason-Dixon bottom line . Many have read about the effects of hyperinflation on the German Weimar Republic. From 1920-1923, prices in Germany increased as much as 3.25 million percent. People burned their old currency for warmth, since it was less costly than buying wood. But, few know that the same type of hyperinflation, albeit to a lesser extent, affected the Confederate States of America. From 1861 to 1864, the commodity price index rose as high as 10 percent a month. By the end of the Civil War, the cost of living in dear old Dixie was 92 percent higher than before the war.

Before joining the newspaper, she was a senior adviser for the Republican National Committee and was named a public affairs director in the Department of Health and Human Services by President George W. Bush. Read her columns here. Tara Wall says Eric Holder's \"nation of cowards\" comment struck the wrong tone. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- First, we're a nation of whiners; now, we're a nation of cowards. The coward comment comes from none other than President Obama's newly minted attorney general, Eric Holder. The remarks were part of a speech Holder delivered for Black History Month. Yet, even in that context, the words came across as arrogant, condescending and not at all becoming a statesman. One dictionary definition of coward is \"lacking courage.\" Stinging words for a country at war, where white and black soldiers are shedding the same color blood. Are they cowards? Ironic too that Holder's remarks come at a time when the nation has just elected its first black president and witnessed the confirmation of its first black attorney general (Holder himself). Forget that more whites than blacks cast their ballots for a black man to lead the nation. So this is how Holder says thanks? Did the attorney general not think about the weight his words would carry? Was he simply trying to be provocative? Is this his way of bringing the races together? Does his position or his color give him the bravado to think that he can get away with calling us cowards? Imagine for a moment if John McCain or George W. Bush uttered those words. The criticism would have known no bounds. i-Report.com: Share your thoughts on Holder's comments . You'll recall, it was just a few months back that a media frenzy erupted when former Sen. Phil Gramm called national leaders (not the nation) a bunch of \"whiners.\" Media pundits and broadcasters blasted Gramm for weeks, until he was forced off McCain's campaign. Gramm's words, while true, were mild in comparison to Holder's. Where is that same outrage and moral condemnation over Holder's loose lips? It's a rhetorical question, of course. And as much as we are constantly reminded of the past \"mistakes\" this country has made, is there nothing worth celebrating, no times when racial harmony brought racial reconciliation? Little of that made it to Holder's speech. Instead, he chose the celebratory occasion to exact punishment by way of guilt. It makes one wonder, why does every race speech by those on the left have to begin (and end) with repudiation and insult? Why must there be a constant reminder of what went wrong without giving due recognition to what went right? I will acknowledge that the country can always do better when it comes to race, but as much as Republicans are accused of refusing to admit racism exists, assuredly Democrats exploit it for every inch of territory they can garner. They point fingers, threaten and name-call without offering real solutions or substantive conversation. One regular reader of The Washington Times, a Democrat, forwarded me a letter he sent to Holder, telling the attorney general how much he \"applauds\" his remarks but saying he had one request: \"I would like to recommend that your office take the lead in ensuring the appointment of at least one African-American on every committee and task force that is created by the President of the United States and current cabinet Secretary's.\" How's that for affirmative action on demand? More like affirmative extortion. The writer also stated in closing: \"Let us (by \"us,\" he means black folks) take advantage of every opportunity that is before us.\" I was particularly struck by the words \"take advantage.\" It is a line of thinking and supposed reasoning to justify black Americans getting what's \"due.\" This was just one person's opinion, but it reflects a sentiment shared by many liberals. It also reveals a get-it-all-while-you-can mentality that has nothing to do with parity, equality or justice but rather with guilt trips, paybacks and quotas. This is not how the \"case for race\" should be made. To be fair, there are some points Holder made with which I do agree (at least in part). \"We, average Americans, simply do not talk enough with each other about race,\" Holder stated. It is a challenge for each of us, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, to go outside our comfort zone and reach out to someone \"different\" from ourselves (though I've done it my whole life). It is an observation that, while true, shouldn't just apply to white people. It applies to black folks, too. Yet that's where the discussion of race loses traction among liberals. Holder doesn't really want to \"talk\" about race, because that would entail not only encouraging blacks to reach out, but it would mean addressing black racism -- which we've seen in the likes of one Rev. Jeremiah Wright -- in addition to white racism (and all racism). Yes, we are sometimes too \"socially segregated,\" as Holder put it, but cowards we are not. And mere rhetoric and rancor does nothing to elevate the discussion. In contrast to Holder's bombastic speech, President Bush's Black History Month speech last year was refreshingly retrospective without being pretentious. While condemning present-day acts of racism (i.e. hanging nooses), Bush also offered a way forward. \"We renew our commitment to securing liberty and justice for every American,\" Bush said, focusing on the present instead of the past: \"We honor four Americans who ... are leading the way toward ending racial injustice across our land.\" Rhetoric aside, what was lacking from Holder's remarks was a way forward. Instead of \"hope,\" Holder offered more hate veiled in subtle anger. Last year, Obama gave a famous speech on race, addressing the controversy about the remarks of his former pastor, Wright, and urging people not to wallow in resentment: . Obama said, \"The profound mistake of Rev. Wright's sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society. It's that he spoke as if our society was static, as if no progress had been made, as if this country -- a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black, Latino and Asian, rich and poor, young and old -- is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past.\" Obama's speech sums it all up. Holder's is a contradiction. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tara Wall.", "fb9541ec38e8211fa43fb17a40a0c9afc917d55e": "(CNN) -- More than 60 years after reneging on a promise to the hundreds of thousands of Filipinos who fought for the United States during World War II, the U.S. government will soon be sending out checks -- to the few who are still alive. Veteran Franco Arcebal says, \"we are loyal to the United States, except that the United States has forgotten us.\" \"For a poor man like me, $15,000 is a lot of money,\" said 91-year-old Celestino Almeda. Still, he said, \"After what we have suffered, what we have contributed for the sake of democracy, it's peanuts. It's a drop in the bucket.\" During the war, the Philippines was a U.S. commonwealth. The U.S. military promised full veterans benefits to Filipinos who volunteered to fight. More than 250,000 joined. Then, in 1946, President Truman signed the Rescission Act, taking that promise away. Today, only about about 15,000 of those troops are still alive, according to the American Coalition for Filipino Veterans. A provision tucked inside the stimulus bill that President Obama signed calls for releasing $198 million that was appropriated last year for those veterans. Those who have become U.S. citizens get $15,000 each; non-citizens get $9,000. \"I'm very thankful,\" said Patrick Ganio, 88, the coalition's president. \"We Filipinos are a grateful people.\" Ganio was among the tens of thousands of Filipinos at the infamous battle of Bataan, a peninsula on Manila Bay opposite the Philippine capital. He was captured and beaten by Japanese troops before ultimately being freed, suffering from malaria and then resuming his service to the U.S. military. \"The record of the Philippine soldiers for bravery and loyalty is second to none,\" Truman wrote to the leaders of the House and Senate in 1946. \"Their assignment was as bloody and difficult as any in which our American soldiers engaged. Under desperate circumstances they acquitted themselves nobly.\" Though Truman said the Rescission Act resulted in \"discrimination,\" he signed it. \"There can be no question but that the Philippine veteran is entitled to benefits bearing a reasonable relation to those received by the America veteran, with whom he fought side by side,\" he said. \"From a practical point of view, however, it must be acknowledged that certain benefits granted by the GI bill of rights cannot be applied in the case of the Philippine veteran.\" Some historians say financial concerns were paramount: The cost of funding full veterans benefits to all those Filipinos, particularly in the wake of the costly war, would have been a heavy burden. The National Alliance for Filipino Veterans Equity offers a different explanation. \"In 1946, discrimination against people of color was the rule of law,\" the group says in a document it submitted to the Obama-Biden transition team in November. \"The second-class treatment of Filipino World War II veterans is another example from this historical period.\" For decades, Filipino activists and their supporters have fought for the full benefits. They've petitioned and picketed. Almeda, a widower who now lives in Virginia with his daughter, once chained himself to the fence outside the White House. \"I was fined $50 for civil disobedience and was arrested,\" he says now, chuckling. He says he was just looking for answers. Despite encouraging words from U.S. presidents, including George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, the benefits were never restored. \"Only 70,000 Philippine veterans remain alive, and they hope to stay alive long enough to see those benefits reinstated,\" CNN reported in 1997. \"There's a bill, stuck in committee in Congress, that would do just that.\" That effort, just like so many before, fell apart. \"We were loyal to the United States. Even up to now, we are loyal to the United States, except that the United States has forgotten us in many ways,\" said Franco Arcebal, another leader of the American Coalition for Filipino Veterans. \"It's only now, because of the insistence of Sen. [Daniel] Inouye in the Senate, he was able to act on this.\" Inouye, D-Hawaii, inserted the language in the stimulus bill, calling it \"a matter of honor.\" The honor comes too late for the many Filipino veterans who passed away waiting for this moment. Families of deceased veterans are not eligible to receive the money. For those who are alive, the checks could make a real difference. \"Practically all of us are below the poverty line now at this age. We have no way of earning a living,\" Arcebal said. But, he emphasized, \"it does not correct the injustice and discrimination done to us 60 years ago. ... We were not granted school benefits. We were not granted hospital benefits. ... And in the 60 years, several billion dollars were saved by the U.S. government for not paying 250,000 of us. \"Now we are only 15,000. And the amount that they're giving us is a small amount. But we appreciate that. Because it will finally recognize our services ... as active service in the armed forces of the United States.\" CNN's Lisa Sylvester contributed to this report.", "31e85dd4fcbb2580f8e223a1cb11e08680317481": "ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- The head of a Kurdish nationalist party in Turkey addressed his party members Tuesday in the Kurdish language -- which is illegal -- prompting the national broadcaster to pull the plug on the live broadcast. Ahmet Turk began his speech in Turkish before switching to Kurdish. In his address, Democratic Society Party leader Ahmet Turk began his speech in Turkish, addressing the value of a \"multilingual culture\" and decrying the fact that the Kurdish language is not protected under Turkey's constitution. \"We have no objection to Turkish being the official language, yet we want our demands for the lifting of the ban on Kurdish language to be understood as a humanitarian demand,\" he said. Turk then announced he would deliver the rest of his speech in Kurdish and, at that point, state broadcaster TRT cut the broadcast. \"Since no language other than Turkish can be used in the parliament meetings according to the constitution of the Turkish Republic and the Political Parties Law, we had to stop our broadcast,\" the TRT announcer stated. \"We apologize to our viewers for this and continue our broadcast with the next news item scheduled.\" The situation is somewhat ironic because Turkey began a new Kurdish language state television channel, TRT6, on January 1. Turk pointed out that paradox in his speech to parliament. \"Despite the Kurdish broadcast on TRT 6, there is no legal protection (for the language),\" he said. \"(Politicians) get punished for speaking Kurdish while Prime Minister (Recep Tayyip) Erdogan speaks Kurdish during rallies. Therefore, Kurdish is forbidden to Kurds yet free for (the ruling party) and the state.\" The issue comes ahead of hotly contested elections scheduled to be held on March 29. Political analysts have said Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, known by its Turkish acronym AKP, is trying to gain votes in the Kurdish southeast, which has traditionally been held by the Democratic Society Party, or DTP. Erdogan's launching of the Kurdish language channel is considered a historic development not only because speaking the language in parliament is illegal, but also because the Turkish republic for decades officially denied the existence of ethnic Kurds, calling them \"mountain Turks\" instead. -- CNN's Ivan Watson contributed to this report.", "c723bd075d6ae41172e6176410e4651248ca1163": "Researchers may be getting closer to an effective way of preventing age-related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision loss among older Americans. A new study found that vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid may help prevent age-related macular degeneration. A new study finds that women who took a combination of B6 and B12 vitamins along with a folic acid supplement had lower risks of developing age-related macular degeneration. The women who got the supplements, compared with those taking a placebo, had a 34 percent lower risk of developing any form of AMD, and a 41 percent lower risk of more severe forms of AMD. Epidemiologist and study author William G. Christen, Sc.D., of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, expects that if these findings are successfully replicated in future studies, \"the combination of these vitamins might become the first prevention method of early stages of age-related macular degeneration other than avoiding cigarette smoking.\" Christen also noted that although the study was conducted among women age 40 and older, there is no particular reason to believe the same results would not hold true in a similar group of men. Christen and his colleagues examined the role of vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid in AMD partly because previous studies have shown these vitamins are known to lower levels of homocysteine, an amino acid found in the blood that when elevated has been associated with higher risks of AMD. The 5,442 women who participated in the randomized, double-blind clinical trial already had heart disease or at least three risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The majority of them did not have AMD at the start of the study, which lasted more than 7 years. Christen explains that the underlying mechanism of AMD likely involves the vascular system, and researchers widely believe that cardiovascular disease and AMD share common risk factors. Age-related macular degeneration is a vision disease common among people older than 60, involving the deterioration of tissues in the macula, the central part of the retina. The condition impedes the performance of critical everyday functions such as reading and driving because it affects the ability to see items that a person is looking at directly, as opposed to items even a few degrees off to either side of the direct line of vision. \"If you affect that central part of your vision, no one goes blind from it but it really interferes with your quality of life,\" explains Dr. Roy Rubinfeld, ophthalmologist and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. There are two types of macular degeneration: wet and dry. Wet forms of AMD are caused by abnormal blood vessels growing beneath the macula, which can rupture and bleed. The dry form is generally caused by cells in the macula degenerating over time and thus losing function. While some treatments do exist for the wet form of the disease (including laser surgery, photodynamic therapy and injections into the eye), there is currently not much in the way of treatments for the more common dry form. When asked if the study results mean that people at high risk for AMD should begin taking a vitamin supplement that provides vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid, retina specialist Dr. Robert Frank of the American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests probably not yet. \"If you do anything, I would take a supplement of antioxidant vitamins containing high doses of vitamins A, E, C and zinc,\" suggests Frank, who has no financial interest in the vitamin supplement industry. These antioxidant vitamins were found to prevent the progression of age-related macular degeneration in the 10-year Age-Related Eye Disease Study conducted by the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health. However, Frank does say that while it still remains to be seen whether people currently taking a multivitamin containing the B vitamins and folic acid will be able to prevent early AMD from developing -- answers which will probably not be found for several years, after a large-scale clinical trial is begun -- there is little risk for most people in taking a daily multivitamin.", "a8b9f7907bbfaf08d43ec304a0a791154535ca93": "(CNN) -- One week in Darfur, the next week at the White House.

The actor met separately with Biden on Monday. \"They've been very involved\" in Darfur, Clooney said. \"Vice President Biden has been incredibly vocal on the issue.\" Clooney, a longtime Darfur activist and a Messenger of Peace for the United Nations, was in Darfur last week with journalists Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times and Ann Curry of NBC. \"I think somehow we should all know that these people are hanging on by the skin of their teeth,\" Clooney told King of his visit. The government of Darfur has waged a brutal counter-insurgency against militias for the past six years, a war that some international critics have characterized as genocide. An estimated 300,000 people have been killed through direct combat, disease or malnutrition, according to the United Nations. An additional 2.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of fighting among rebels, government forces and the allied Janjaweed militias. Clooney said of his conversations with Obama and Biden: \"Basically, we were just talking about coming back from Chad and right on the border of Darfur. And we were talking about there's a moment coming up relatively soon -- probably by the middle of next week -- where the International Criminal Court is going to indict the president of Sudan for war crimes, which has never happened before -- a sitting president.\" Last year, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was charged with genocide by the International Criminal Court for the government's campaign of violence in Darfur. The violence erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Khartoum government. Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength. Under pressure to end the fighting, Al-Bashir in November agreed to an immediate and unconditional cease-fire in Darfur. \"This isn't about needing American dollars,\" Clooney said of the push for peace in Darfur. \"I understand that it's a very difficult time. It's not about needing American troops. It's about needing what we do best -- what we have done best since the start of this country -- which is good, robust diplomacy all across the world.\" The priorities, as Clooney advocated to Obama and Biden: . -- An envoy working full time on bringing peace to Darfur -- someone \"getting up every morning with their sole job to find peace in the area,\" he said. -- Persuading China to leverage its investment muscle in Darfur to push for peace. -- Pressing Egypt, the African Union and Europe to strengthen diplomatic efforts in the region. \"Diplomacy has to start and it has to be aggressive and it has to start soon. We have an opportunity here,\" Clooney said.", "5a5c15d8d198b243a59bd98b1717ce55a98b0080": "(CNN) -- Nineteen political prisoners were released by the government of Myanmar over the weekend, the human rights group Amnesty International reported Tuesday. Protesters demand democracy for Myanmar at a demonstration in New Delhi, India earlier this month. Among those released was Ma Khin Khin Leh, who was serving a life sentence because her husband, a student activist, had helped plan a protest demonstration in Bago in July 1999, according to Amnesty International USA's Web blog . Authorities prevented the demonstration from taking place, but took the woman and her three-year-old daughter into custody after failing to find her husband, Amnesty International said. The child was released after five days but her mom, a 33-year-old school teacher, was sentenced to life in prison. \"Even by the normally harsh standards of 'justice' meted out by Myanmar's military government, the life sentence given to Ma Khin Khin Leh was extreme,\" the human rights organization said. She was designated one of Amnesty International USA's priority cases. She was released with 18 others \"widely considered to be political prisoners,\" Amnesty International said. Myanmar's military rulers have been widely condemned for their alleged human rights abuses. Pro-democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi has been confined in her home for 12 of the past 18 years. Her last house arrest began in 2003 and has been periodically renewed. In October 2007, clashes erupted between pro-democracy demonstrators and government security forces. As many as 110 people are believed to have been killed in that crackdown, including 40 Buddhist monks. The protests were sparked by a huge fuel price increase imposed by the military government, and quickly escalated. Myanmar's military junta said in mid-October that it had detained more than 2,900 people amid the clashes. In September 2008, Amnesty International reported that Myanmar, also called Burma, had released seven dissidents, among them U Win Tin, a journalist and senior official in the opposition National League for Democracy who had been imprisoned for 19 years.", "eb9177b8462d6c9d5ce0d99a36414a560d2e6d5c": "(CNN) -- Israeli President Shimon Peres said he had an amicable phone conversation with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a day after Erdogan stormed offstage during an angry exchange with Peres at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan leaves the stage Thursday, as Israeli President Shimon Peres sits, left. Peres said he and Erdogan did not take the spat personally. \"I called him up and said, yes, it's nothing against you, nothing against Turkey. We consider you as a friend,\" Peres said. He said Erdogan reciprocated. Although there was no mention of an apology, Peres said there was a polite exchange between the two leaders. \"I didn't take it personally. I didn't go for a personal fight. I answered unfounded accusations. It was my duty. And they didn't change my mind,\" he said.  Watch Shimon Peres on the Gaza conflict \u00bb . Turkey, a predominantly Muslim nation, has long been the Jewish state's closest military and economic partner in the region, and Turkey recently mediated indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria. But many Turks have been incensed with Israel over its three-week military operation that ended there earlier this month. And in Davos, Erdogan was angered after Peres said that Israel is committed to peace and blamed Hamas for the fighting in Gaza, where Israel staged a three-week military operation that ended earlier this month. When Erdogan began responding, a moderator cut him off, saying the debate had run over its allotted time. Erdogan patted the moderator on the arm until he was granted one more minute to respond.  Watch commentary on Erdogan's angry exchange \u00bb . \"I know the reason behind raising your voice is because of the guilty psychology,\" he said to Peres. \"My voice will not be that loud. You must know that. When it comes to killing -- you know killing very well. I know how you hit, kill children on the beaches.\" He then left the stage, complaining that Peres was receiving preferential treatment. \"From now on, Davos is finished for me,\" Erdogan said. \"I will not come back. You won't let people talk. You gave him 25 minutes, but you gave me 12 minutes. This is not right.\" Erdogan had described the military campaign against Hamas fighters in Gaza as \"barbaric\" and accused Israel of using excessive force. He said: \"The Palestinian Territories are like an open-air prison, isolated from the world. I have always been a leader who said anti-Semitism is a crime against humanity. But so is anti-Islamism.\" Peres had said Hamas was responsible for the \"tragedy,\" accusing the Islamist militants of creating a \"dangerous dictatorship.\" \"Israel left Gaza completely -- no occupation,\" Peres said. \"I want to understand why they throw rockets at us.\" On Friday, after his outburst, Erdogan returned home to a hero's welcome. Thousands of people lined up at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, cheering and waving signs. A large banner read, \"You Will Never Walk Alone,\" and smaller signs bore phrases including \"Davos Conqueror.\" People also were seen waving Turkish and Palestinian flags and throwing flowers on the road leading to Erdogan's home. Despite the glowing response at the airport, there has been some criticism in the Turkish media of Erdogan's exchange with the Israeli president. CNN Turk's Deniz Bayramoglu said the issue was still \"hot\" with Erdogan's secularist political opponents speaking out against the prime minister. \"They also say that Israel's behavior in Gaza is unacceptable but they are very critical of Prime Minister Erdogan's behavior,\" Bayramoglu said. \"Some are saying they are really proud of Prime Minister Erdogan and some are saying it is a diplomatic scandal.\" Erdogan explained whom he was directing his anger at during a news conference at the airport. \"My words were only to the Israeli government, not the Israeli people,\" he said.

All eight Liyana band members met at the King George VI school for disabled children in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. The Afro-fusion melody comes from an unlikely source -- the small, wheelchair-ridden body of Prudence Mabhena, a woman from Zimbabwe who has overcome her physical disabilities and the hurdles of daily life in her home country. \"Some people don't even get you and take you as a person,\" Mabhena said. \"And with us singing right now, we're not giving up -- we're pushing up.\" Mabhena is the lead singer of Liyana, a group of eight musicians who are all physically disabled and from Zimbabwe. Their message of hope has been drowned out in their home country, which is suffering from an economic collapse, a cholera outbreak, and a political power struggle that has erupted into violence.  Watch the band performing \u00bb . Mabhena was born with arthrogryphosis, a muscle and joint disorder, and had to have parts of her arms and legs amputated as a result. She said her mother was told to kill her rather than have her face life as a physically disabled woman in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe was once a center for disability rights after it gained independence in 1980, according to recent report on Public Radio International. It was one of the first countries to recognize the rights of the disabled, who are sometimes shunned by communities in rural Africa who fear they are touched by witchcraft. But the gains for the disabled in Zimbabwe have been erased by the country's current crisis, according to Dr. Raymond Lang of the London-based Cheshire Center for Conflict Recovery who spoke to PRI's Lonny Shavelson. Mabhena said the group is apprehensive about returning to Zimbabwe after its U.S. tour, which wrapped up this month. But none of the members of Liyana dwell on the despair. \"'Never give up' -- it's one of our biggest and strongest mottos,\" said singer Tapiwa Nyenger, explaining one of the band's song titles. \"We have the capability to go on stage and at the end of the day make people smile. It's a good feeling.\" All eight band members, who are between the ages of 17 and 23, met at the King George VI school for disabled children in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. The band describes their music as a fusion between \"myriad geographic, cultural, and musical genres including gospel, reggae, and traditional Zimbabwean Shona music.\" Liyana means \"rain\" -- a Shona term for good luck. \"Music makes you think of something positive,\" Nyenger said. \"For me, music is rehabilitation.\" Mabhena has said her voice is a gift from god. They had long dreamed of performing in the United States, and their multi-city tour included more than 20 performances in California and the New York metro area, including the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark. \"We have been received in an overwhelming, heart-filling way,\" Nyenger said. \"Everywhere we go, every place we go, we [see] new things, we meet new people, we learn new stuff.\" The band's U.S. tour coincided with President Barack Obama's inauguration, which has also been a source of inspiration for a new song, \"Obama.\" \"When we heard Obama was going to be the American president, the first black American president, we were so excited,\" Mabhena said. \"Through that joy that we had, there came a song.\" Liyana is also the subject of a new documentary, iTemba -- My Hope -- which is scheduled to be released worldwide later this year. The band's singers perform in seven languages -- Shona, Ndebele, English, Dutch, German, Hebrew, and Spanish -- allowing them to reach a wider audience. \"We want to leave a message to everyone in the world that no matter what circumstance you are in, you can make it,\" singer Marvelous Meulo said.", "3e72553ce77e7d7592aaf3014bd18a33162064da": "(CNN)  -- The second-highest ranking official in Iraqi President Jalal Talabani's political party resigned Saturday, along with four other high-ranking Kurdish politicians, officials said. Iraqi President Jalal Talabani could be jeopardized by the resignations of five key members of his party. Khosrat Rasul, the vice president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, resigned, along with four other members of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), according to Kurdish lawmakers. Rasul is a battle-scarred veteran of Kurdish rebellions against former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Kurdish members of the Iraqi Parliament say the resignations threaten the delicate balance of power in Iraqi Kurdistan, a semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq. It has been the most stable part of the country since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. \"It looks very serious,\" said Ala Talabani, the president's niece and a PUK member, as well as a member of Parliament. She spoke by phone from the Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya, long a stronghold of the PUK. \"It's about corruption,\" Ala Talabani said of the resignations. \"They are asking about the resources and the money. Who is spending it. And who is in charge of the income of the party.\" \"It's not good,\" said Mahmoud Othman, a member of the Iraqi Parliament and an independent Kurdish politician. \"The PUK is one of the main two [Kurdish] players,\" he added. \"A problem like this will upset the whole situation.\" Iraqi Kurdistan broke free from Baghdad's control after the 1991 Gulf War. Since then, the region has been divided between two rival Kurdish factions, Talabani's PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, led by Massoud Barzani. For several years throughout the 1990s, the groups battled each other in the mountains and valleys of northern Iraq. Those historic divisions faded somewhat following the United States' overthrow of Hussein. For the past five years, the Kurds have worked together in Baghdad to enhance the Kurdish region's position in Iraq. Kurdish politicians deftly took advantage of divisions between Sunni and Shi'a Arab factions. They successfully lobbied to maintain Kurdistan's militia of pesh merga fighters. Demands to expand the Kurdish zone of control and win the right to exploit oil deposits in Kurdish territory have increased tensions between Kurdish and Arab politicians. The resignation of Rasul and his allies threatens the power base of Talabani, the first Kurdish president in Iraqi history. \"If it is not fixed by Talabani by tomorrow, this could change the entire landscape of Kurdish politics,\" said Hiwa Osman, the Iraq country director of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting. Iraq's three northern Kurdish provinces are scheduled to hold regional elections in May. Talabani is expected to travel to Kurdistan to hold emergency meetings with Rasul and his other former comrades-in-arms. This is not the first time the stout Kurdish leader has faced a rebellion from within the ranks of his followers. Kurdish observers say these disputes usually stem from disagreements over money and power.", "938357445ba10ac9d82bc266aa917983c7845caa": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Iran may be holding a former FBI agent in a bid to exchange him for Iranians seized by U.S. troops in Iraq in 2007, a U.S. senator suggested Tuesday. Christine Levinson, wife of Robert Levinson, went to Tehran in 2007 to try to learn her husband's fate. Robert Levinson disappeared from Iran's Kish Island in March 2007. Iranian authorities have repeatedly said they don't have any information on him, but that is widely doubted in the United States. \"On several diplomatic occasions when Bob Levinson's name has been brought up to Iranian officials, the standard answer is, 'We don't know anything about that.' But the next thing out of the Iranian officials' mouths are to discuss the matter of the Iranians held by the Americans in Irbil, Iraq,\" Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, told reporters. \"You can draw your own conclusions.\" U.S. troops arrested five Iranians accused of being members of an elite Iranian military unit during a January 2007 raid in the Kurdish city of Irbil. They were accused of supporting Shiite militias in Iraq, but Iran said they were diplomats and accused the United States of violating international law by raiding a consulate. The United States said the men were taken at a liaison office that lacks diplomatic status. Two were released the next November. Nelson and Florida Democratic Rep. Robert Wexler, whose district includes Levinson's Coral Springs home, are trying to jump-start efforts to find the missing man. Wexler said Iranian authorities have not assisted the Levinsons, saying they have \"zero knowledge\" of his whereabouts and are stonewalling \"any effort to gain pertinent information.\" Levinson's wife, Christine, said her husband was working as a private investigator on a cigarette smuggling case when he disappeared. \"It's been extremely difficult for my family,\" she said. \"We hope to resolve this as soon as possible.\" Wexler and Nelson said they plan to introduce legislation in their respective houses calling on Iran to cooperate with the United States and come up with information about Levinson. Nelson said Iran could use Levinson's case as a show of good will toward the incoming Obama administration, which has said it wants to engage Iran after three decades without diplomatic relations. \"We hope that Iran will take this moment in time to show a change in the relationship with the United States by doing this humanitarian gesture for this family,\" he said. In a January 22 letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Wexler asked that the case be raised \"at the highest levels.\" Nelson raised Levinson's status during Clinton's confirmation hearing. Nelson said the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations has discussed Levinson's case with him under the \"fiction\" that he represents the people of Florida, not the U.S. government. But he said the Iranians have never acknowledged holding the former federal agent. Levinson had been working as a private investigator in Dubai and was last heard from on March 8, 2007. His family said he checked into a hotel on Kish Island and then checked out the next day to go back to the United States, but he never boarded his flight. Levinson family members have met with local Iranian officials and have traveled to Iran to retrace his steps. Christine Levinson also flew to the United Nations in September to ask questions about her husband, whom she says suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure. The family has offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to his safe return. The State Department and FBI have consistently denied Levinson was working for the government and have demanded Iran free Levinson -- if it is holding him. State Department spokesman Robert Wood said the U.S. government has called on Iran to provide more information about the matter \"for some time.\" \"His family's extremely concerned, as you can understand, that no information has been forthcoming,\" Wood said. \"So, again, we call on the Iranians to provide whatever information they have on Mr. Levinson so that we can hopefully return this gentleman to his family.\"", "869ca6636dfe98eaec685e17374723c2180a222a": "(CNN) -- A recent scientific expedition in Colombia's mountainous Darien region has unearthed 10 new species of amphibians, an environmental organization said. A new species of salamander was one of the exciting discoveries in Colombia's Darien region. Scientists with Conservation International on Monday announced the discovery of 10 new species in what's being referred to as a safe haven for frogs located in the west of the country on the border with Panama. The discovery of 10 amphibians, which are believed to be new to science, was the result of a three-week survey of the area, the group said. The new species were discovered as part of a CI program aimed at assessing the ecological health of a given area. Scientists identified nearly 60 species of amphibians, 20 reptiles and 120 species of birds, the group said in a prepared statement. The discoveries come as global extinction rates continue to rise. Experts with Conservation International argue that the discovery is particularly significant since amphibians serve as an accurate gauge of an area's ecological health. Amphibians can act as an early warning sign of pollution such as acid rain due to their porous, absorbent skin. The sensitivity of these species to low level environmental threats can also act as a barometer for human health. Conservation International says the discovery offered renewed optimism. \"The high number of new amphibian species found is a sign of hope, even with the serious threat of extinction that this animal group faces in many other regions of the country and the world, \" says Jose Vicente Rodriguez Mahecha, Scientific Director of CI-Colombia, who was part of the team that discovered the new species. The region is, however, not immune to modern threats. According to Conservation International, between 25 percent to 30 percent of the natural vegetation in the Darien area is currently being deforested. For the scientists, the hope now is that the discoveries will renew efforts to conserve the region and manage its rich biodiversity.", "26eb182596399e9da140c307a1191958f1e198d3": "(CNN) -- Israel was founded on democratic principles with the Jewish state's declaration of independence in 1948 including a commitment to the \"complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.\" It has remained a continuous democracy ever since. The 120-seat Knesset is the Israeli seat of government. The seat of Israeli government is the Knesset, the country's national parliament, located in Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its capital. The Knesset's 120 lawmakers are elected by universal suffrage with all Israeli citizens over the age of 18 entitled to vote. Knesset seats are divided according to each party's proportion of the overall vote. But parties must poll at least two percent nationally to gain a seat. Participation in elections, including among Arab Israelis who constitute around 20 percent of the population, has traditionally been high at around 80 percent turnout, according to Israeli government figures. Israel currently has around 5.3 million eligible voters. Israel usually holds national elections every four years. But this year's poll on February 10 was called early -- less than three years since the last vote -- by Israeli President Shimon Peres following the resignation of prime minister Ehud Olmert amid allegations of corruption and his Kadima Party successor Tzipi Livni's failure to form a coalition. Olmert has continued to serve as caretaker prime minister in the interim. Coalitions of two or more parties are common in Israel; in fact no party has ever won enough votes to form a government by itself. Those remaining outside the ruling coalition make up the opposition. Thirty-four parties will participate in the 2009 elections, including major parties such as Kadima, Likud and Labor and also three Arab parties. The task of forming and leading a government is charged by Israel's president to the Knesset member and party leader considered to have the best chance of forming a viable coalition. The prime minister-designate then has 28 days, extendable by 14 days, to build a coalition commanding the support of at least 61 Knesset members. Officials results are due to be published on February 18 with the new Knesset convening on March 2.", "2abf786570b9f9de945c70d9678cb67dd2a2e57e": "BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Marxist guerrillas admit they recently killed eight Indians whom the rebels accused of collaborating with the Colombian government, media outlets reported Tuesday. In Bogota, Colombia, last week, Luis Evelis Andrade denounces the killings of Indians by FARC rebels. Human rights organizations and a state governor last week had accused the the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as FARC, of killing at least 27 Awa Indians in southwest Colombia in the past two weeks. The FARC issued a statement dated February 11 saying the guerrillas detained and \"executed\" eight people on February 6 in the town of Rio Bravo because the Indians were gathering information about the rebels to give to the Colombian military. The FARC statement was posted Tuesday by the New Colombia News Agency and Caracol Radio's Web site. The statement said the guerrillas were not targeting indigenous populations but took the action \"against people who independent of their race, religion, ethnicity, social condition etc. accepted money and put themselves at the service of the army in an area that is the object of military operations.\" The FARC communication also urged the Indians not to be manipulated by government officials who say the guerrillas are out to harm indigenous populations. \"They know of our respect for the civil community,\" the statement said, adding that a government that \"never has looked out for these indigenous communities and has plunged them into war can't be their defenders. They are their executioners!\" Last week, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe called the FARC \"executioners\" for killing Indians. \"Let the world know: The Democratic Security [forces] protect the indigenous because it is for all Colombians,\" Uribe said. \"And the FARC deceive the country, they assassinate the indigenous.\" The governor of Narino state, Navarro Wolff, said last week the FARC had killed 10 Awa in one incident a few days earlier and 17 others the previous week. Luis Evelis Andrade of the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia, known by its Spanish acronym ONIC, said the FARC had targeted the Awa because the Indians don't want to get involved in the armed struggle and refuse to reveal information on government troop actions. Speaking on Caracol TV, ONIC said the FARC has abducted 120 Awa since February 4 and 44 Awa have been killed this year. Others also shared their concern. \"We are very worried about the Awa community,\" said Monsignor Gustavo Giron Higuita, the bishop of the city of Tumaco. \"It is a community that is pretty unprotected and that in the past five years has received a type of persecution by armed groups.\" The Awa, he said, \"are pacifist, want respect of their organization and want to regain their traditions. We have been accompanying them in this process, and that's why this hurts so much.\" Colombian Attorney General Alejandro Ordonez Maldonado ordered the nation's human rights commissioner to launch an investigation and take steps to help the Awa. The Human Rights Watch organization said Wednesday that the guerrillas tortured some of the Awa before killing them with knives. \"These cruel killings violate the most basic principles of human decency and dignity,\" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director at Human Rights Watch. \"There is no possible excuse or justification for these horrific actions.\" Monsignor Ruben Salazar Gomez, the president of the Episcopal Conference of Colombia, joined last week's chorus of criticism, calling the killings a \"very grave ... crime the whole country should condemn.\" New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a release that group members have made numerous visits to Narino, which is one of Colombia's 32 departments, or states. Narino is in southwest Colombia, on the Pacific Ocean and the border with Ecuador. The area has a heavy presence of various armed groups and Colombian military forces and has among the worst human rights conditions in Colombia, the human rights group said. The Awa territories have been particularly affected. The Colombian government has issued a \"risk report\" warning that civilians in the region are in danger. The FARC is said to have \"confined\" some villages, cutting them off from the outside world and not allowing anyone to enter or leave. The FARC, the largest and oldest guerrilla group in Colombia, has been waging war against the government since the 1960s. Security analysts say the FARC has about 9,000 to 12,000 armed guerillas and several thousand supporters, mostly in rural areas. The guerrilla group operates mostly in Colombia but has carried out extortion, kidnappings, bombings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador.", "80754c02b5580c40b8aaa1671f97b13e39e2cf43": "RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- Former presidents of Mexico, Colombia and Brazil called Wednesday for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in tactics on the war on drugs, a Spanish news agency said. People march in support of legalized marijuana in late January in Belem, northern Brazil. Ex-presidents Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil made their announcement at a meeting in Brazil of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy, the EFE news agency said. \"The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results,\" Gaviria said at a news conference in which the commission's recommendations were presented. The 17-member panel worked on the report for a year and will forward it to all Latin American governments as well as the United States and the European Union, EFE said. Gaviria said the time is right to start a debate on the subject, particularly with the pragmatic openings provided by the election of President Barack Obama in the United States. \"In many states in the United States, as is the case in California, they have begun to change federal policies with regard to tolerating marijuana for therapeutic purposes. And in Washington there's some consensus that the current policy is failing,\" EFE quotes Gaviria as saying. Decriminalization should be accompanied by treatment for addicts and public service campaigns on abuse prevention, the commission said. \"If you don't help those who are dependent, you are half way there because they are going to commit crime to get money and pay for the drug,\" Gaviria said. Cardoso said the group called for only the decriminalization of marijuana and not other illicit drugs because \"you have to start somewhere\" and it would have been unrealistic to ask the same for all drugs, EFE said. Marijuana was chosen because it is grown in all countries in the region and because it is \"less harmful.\" The decades-old criminalization of personal consumption has failed to stop the plant's cultivation and distribution, the group said. The commission urged that all current criminal prosecution be aimed at drug cartels and organized crime and not marijuana smokers, EFE said. Zedillo did not attend the news conference but worked on the report, Cardoso said. Wednesday's recommendation was the second time in less than a week that a Latin American government official called for decriminalization. A mayor in Peru suggested Friday that the federal government legalize illicit drugs and administer them through the national health ministry. Gusto Sierra, the mayor of the Surquillo district in Lima, said a federal drug law is hypocritical because it allows maximum legally allowed quantities for some drugs and plants but doesn't say where to acquire them, the Peru 21 newspaper reported in a front-page story headlined \"Say yes to drugs?\" Sierra said he will take the matter up with the nation's executive branch. Zedillo served as president of Mexico from 1994-2000. Gaviria was president of Colombia from 1990-94. And Cardoso led Brazil from 1995-2002.", "3bb0115e2c06dd6f6480bfef18b74654ea93baae": "(CNN) -- Malmo is a shopper's heaven.

The band developed its dreamy pop sound in the Southern Swedish town of Malmo. Singer Nina Persson finds musical inspiration in love and relationships. They were catapulted to international success in 1997, when the single \"Lovefool\" appeared on the soundtrack for \"Romeo and Juliet,\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. The song's chorus (\"Love me, love me, say that you love me\") became a pop anthem. In addition to fronting The Cardigans, Persson, 34, has worked on solo projects under the name A Camp. Now, after a near decade long hiatus, her second A Camp album, \"Colonia,\" is due out later this month. Persson, who splits her time between New York and Malmo, talks to CNN's \"My City, My Life\" about music, inspiration and life after \"Lovefool.\" CNN: How did The Cardigans start? Nina Persson: We formed the band in this town where we are all originally from -- Jonkoping -- and that was in 1992. Magnus and Peter were the two guys who actually met and wanted to form the band. And then they recruited people and I was one of the first to be recruited, along with a friend of mine who played guitar in the first version of The Cardigans. I had not sung before that really. I was sort of hired because they knew they wanted a girl singing. And I was like 'I'm a girl' and I guess we got along well and I was willing to learn to sing. So that's how it started really.  Watch Nina take CNN on a tour of her favorite Malmo spots \u00bb . CNN: How big was music in your life before you joined the band? Nina Persson: I've loved music my whole life. But I never really listened to a record and thought that was something that I wanted to do. I was interested in becoming a painter, an architect, a designer. Those are the things I was interested in. But music, I never took instrument classes -- it was a random thing to start doing. CNN: Sometime a career finds you? Nina Persson: Yeah and I was a person who was really helped by it. I was looking for something but I didn't know what it was and it proved to fulfill what I needed at the time. CNN: How is A Camp different from The Cardigans? Nina Persson: It's hard to say what makes it different because I'm still doing the same thing -- I'm still writing songs and singing them -- but it feels like it's a bigger freedom because I am in charge in A Camp. I like both. Both serve good purposes. I like to be in the collective, being part of the machinery, but I also really enjoy being dictator. CNN: How do you define yourself as a musician now? Nina Persson: Well I'm not. I'm not one of these people who live and breathe music. In the beginning I was a reluctant musician -- I still haven't bothered to learn an instrument. I'm still only a singer and that's how I write my songs. I'm always superstitious that if I do learn an instrument I would pop the bubble a bit. CNN: Is there anything else you would have liked to have done if you hadn't done singing? Nina Persson: At the time when I was found, picked up by the band, I was into art. I was really good at drawing, really creative. I made stuff, I built stuff, I sewed stuff. I thought I would end up in that world somewhere. Photography was a big thing for me. In retrospect, I'm sure that could have been a good career for me. But recently I've started to wish that I could start over and dedicate my life to medicine. I would have loved to go to med school. I don't think I will because I don't want to spend seven or eight years in training, but I dream about working in a hospital. CNN: What were your inspirations over the years? Nina Persson: That's an incredibly difficult question to answer, but I think I'm a sucker for constantly going back to the subject of love and relationships. It also varies very much from project to project and month to month. I'm very emotional when it comes to the music. I want to make people cry. CNN: Tell us the story of how the band ended up in Malmo.  See photos of Nina in Malmo \u00bb . Nina Persson: We moved here because we started to record in Tambourine Studios which was here. Most studios are in Stockholm so sort of all roads wanted to drag us to Stockholm but we did persist and came here. CNN: When you came to Malmo, what was it like starting out in the early days? Nina Persson: Our parents helped us move down here which was really sweet. They sort of dropped us off and waved goodbye and we moved in. We really did hang out, the five of us, quite exclusively in the beginning. CNN: What was the area like back then? Has it changed? Nina Persson: Well actually the area where I now live hasn't changed that much. A lot of Malmo has moved away from the blue collar past it has, but not that area. It has strangely remained the same, and I like it. CNN: Do you think the gritty atmosphere of Malmo has helped you stay grounded? Nina Persson: Well it's hard to say how much has to do with the people we are or how much to do with Malmo. But there certainly is something here that does not encourage big headedness. CNN: The musical heritage of Malmo is quite rocky. How did you guys fit in? Nina Persson: People thought we were really ridiculous when we came to this totally rock place and played pop music. So we didn't fit in at all -- we were never part of the scene here. CNN: You were happy to be outsiders of the rocky heritage? Nina Persson: I think we felt sort of cool about doing our own thing. We thought we knew something that the others didn't understand. CNN: Is there something about Malmo that helps shape your music or influence you? Nina Persson: I think Malmo did have a big influence on us. Obviously we came here for the sound, and we got the sound we wanted. We were away from the industry -- that was great for us. I really did appreciate being in a place where there is not a lot whole of press and industry. Nina takes . CNN: So you also live in New York. What brings you back to Malmo? Nina Persson: For me, I love Malmo very much because of my friendships. In Malmo I get the intimacy and get to run into my friends in the street once in a while which is a lovely feeling and I get to have a great grocery store just around the corner. CNN: If Malmo was a person, what kind of person would it be? Nina Persson: It would be somebody who has been around for a while and survived a lot of hardships -- somebody you don't mess with, somebody really intelligent, stubborn, with a lot of beauty on the inside.", "3defbb6415c7cf02fc59d9453962bd5e7d539b6f": "JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Palestinian militants fired a long-range rocket from Gaza into southwestern Israel on Tuesday morning. It was the first such attack into the city of Ashkelon since the two sides declared a cease-fire, the Israeli military said. This aerial view shows the power station and industrial zone of Ashkelon, Israel, in March of 2008. The missile fired from a Grad rocket launcher did not cause any injuries or damage in the coastal city, said a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. Rockets fired from a Grad have a longer range than the crude, home-made Qassams that Palestinian militants in Gaza fire more frequently. Militants have used Grads to strike farther into Israel. Ashkelon lies 12 miles (19 km) north of Gaza. Israel and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, declared separate, tentative cease-fires two weeks ago after more than three weeks of fighting in Gaza. Israel launched the attack on Hamas in Gaza on December 27 with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks on southern Israel. More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, were also killed in the fighting. Since the two sides declared a cease-fire on January 21, militants have sporadically fired rockets into Israel. Israel has responded with air strikes.

Residents check out a destroyed police building after a car bombing Sunday night in Cali, Colombia. It was the second bombing in Colombia attributed to the Marxist guerrilla group in less than a week. An explosion at a Blockbuster video rental store in an upscale Bogota neighborhood Tuesday killed two and wounded more than 20. The suspect in Sunday night's attack was killed in a shootout with police after the explosion, Cali Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina said Monday, hours after convening a special security meeting in the middle of the night. \"Although the explosive device only had moderate impact,\" Ospina said on the Cali government Web site, \"we should not forget we are at war and the FARC has been committing terrorist acts in Bogota, Neiva, Cali and other cities in the country. That's why we cannot let our guard down, since they take advantage of Sundays and city centers, where control is more difficult.\" The explosion came just hours after the rebel group released four hostages in what many interpreted as a gesture to reach a peace accord with the government. Two officials also are slated to be released this week. FARC, which is the Spanish acronym for Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, is the largest and oldest revolutionary group in the nation and has been at war with the government for more than 40 years. According to Ospina, a blue and red Renault 12 Break pickup crashed into the police headquarters in Cali at 10:38 p.m. and then exploded. The driver tried to flee but was felled by two shots from uniformed police and died a few hours later at a hospital, the mayor said. The explosion caused damage in a two-block area, the Cali news Web site Semana.com said. Five of the 14 wounded were minors, Ospina said, citing emergency director Laureano Quintero. The injured are suffering from fractures and other wounds not considered life-threatening, he said. Cali's health minister, Alejandro Varela, said earlier 32 were wounded, including a pregnant woman who was in good condition. Others complained of hearing problems. The mayor's office said the previous higher tally could be a result of people not wounded in the bombing but seeking medical attention to receive government help. Three police were wounded, including a major with a broken arm and an officer who had to have three fingers amputated on his left hand, said the police chief, Gustavo Adolfo Ricaurte Tapia. The bombing caused a temporary power outage, which made security more difficult for officials, said the news Web site Burladero.com. It was the fourth bombing in Cali in less than 42 months, Semana.com said. The latest bombing took place about five blocks from the Palace of Justice, which was blasted by a car bomb in August, killing four and wounding 26. Police buildings were bombed in April 2007 and August 2006. The earlier blast killed five and wounded 17, Semana.com said. Security analysts say FARC has about 9,000 to 12,000 armed guerillas and several thousand supporters, mostly in rural areas. The guerrilla group was established in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party. The guerrillas operate mostly in Colombia but have carried out extortion, kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador, according to the Federation of American Scientists Intelligence Resource Program. Authorities said Sunday night's bomb contained 90 kilograms (198 pounds) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and fuel, a commonly used explosive, Semana.com said. By comparison, the bomb that Timothy McVeigh used in the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, contained more than 2,800 kilos (6,200 pounds) of ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel.", "eae1154155c11e1ce91d15350f6f97956e3792b7": "Editor's note: CNN has asked its journalists across the country to offer their thoughts on how the economic crisis is affecting their cities. In this installment, Bob Crowley reports from Boston, Massachusetts. Hardware store owner Brendan Kenney says \"people who have money should go out and spend it.\" BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Brendan Kenney has seen enough bad news about the economy. \"I'm also getting tired of being worried,\" he says. His family has been running a small hardware store in Brookline, Massachusetts, just outside Boston, for about 56 years. He says business has slowed down a little, but mostly because winter is normally the slow time of year for them. Though he hopes the stimulus plan will help his and other small businesses, he believes people shouldn't be afraid. \"I think the American consumer holds a lot of power,\" he continues. \"I think people who have money should go out and spend it.\" Like many in the Boston area, Kenney doesn't want to hear more discouraging stories and sees that as part of the problem. \"It's just negative story after negative story, kind of creating a crisis of confidence.\"  Watch Boston-area reaction to the economic slump \u00bb . South of Boston, Jose Nieto, from Plainville, has his own reasons to be discouraged. Between September and October of last year, he was laid off twice. Nieto, a civil engineer who works on road construction projects, had felt fortunate. After losing his job of 14 years, he was able to find employment after only being out of work for two weeks. After being on the new job for three weeks, however, he got called into the boss's office. \"I said, 'Oh, no. My God, not again.'\" He was faced with looking for work in an industry that traditionally slows down in the winter months. \"It's more than losing your job. It gives you a feeling of rejection,\" he says. Yet, Nieto feels this is a time to learn valuable lessons, especially for those who need to dip into their savings when unemployment checks don't cover all of the bills. \"I think a lot of people will learn from this situation, and, going forward, they'll try to save more money.\" He has been trying to stay healthy, busy and positive. Passing the time working on projects in his basement workshop and taking yoga classes has helped him get through the rough spots, and his luck is turning. He was offered a job that starts in March. \"It is a relief, because I'm employed,\" he says, \"however, I'm taking a job for much less money.\" Nieto believes that most employers cannot afford to hire at the salaries they could offer in the past. Like Kenney's hardware store, Sue Stein's American craft gallery, also in Brookline, is not seeing any major shifts in her business, yet. \"Our business has been certainly down, but not devastating,\" she says. Fire Opal, her gallery, sells everything from earrings to pottery to scarves, all made by artists from around the country. To keep her business healthy, she says, she is trying to make adjustments like buying less merchandise. But she is changing her approach to her customers as well. She says she tries to keep \"understanding that people are having a hard time and trying to find things that are more in their price range.\" Like Kenney and Nieto, Stein is also trying to stay optimistic. \"I think if we all are very careful,\" she says, \"we'll sort of ride it out and then things will adjust.\"", "6de29017a7f8d6a1f92273466087a411faa26210": "Editor's note: Fareed Zakaria is a foreign affairs analyst who hosts \"Fareed Zakaria: GPS\" on CNN at 1  and 6 p.m. ET Sundays. \"Banks are still reporting large losses, credit remains tight, home prices continue to fall,\" notes Fareed Zakaria. NEW YORK (CNN) -- President Barack Obama offered more detail on his plan to restore economic growth Friday, saying the economic stimulus program being debated in Congress is just one of at least three parts to his recovery plan. In a meeting to discuss the stimulus proposal with Vice President Joe Biden and Democratic and Republican congressional leadership, Obama said America also needs an improved financial system stability program as well as an overhaul of financial market regulation. CNN talked to world affairs expert and author Fareed Zakaria to get his thoughts about the most pressing issues facing the new president.  CNN: What should be  President Obama's first order of business?  Zakaria: Oh, without question, the economy. This is a problem that isn't going away. Banks are still reporting large losses, credit remains tight, home prices continue to fall. It's difficult to tell whether the measures enacted have not had time to work, or that they are not working. But the basic reality remains -- the financial system is in crisis, and as a result, the American economy is in a dangerous paralysis. President Obama needs to focus like a laser beam on this issue above and beyond everything else. CNN: Does that mean foreign policy takes a back seat? Zakaria: Not a back seat, but if I were advising him, I would suggest that he save his presidential time, energy and political capital for the economy. He will probably need to go to Congress soon and ask for more money and more authority. Now, having said all this, the trouble with foreign policy is that it doesn't wait around for you until the time is convenient. Things happen and you have to react to them -- like the violence in Gaza. That's probably why the president called the foreign leaders he did on his first day -- [Palestinian President Mahmoud] Abbas [Israeli Prime Minister Ehud] Olmert, [Saudi] King Abdullah and [Egyptian President Hosni] Mubarak. He had to make sure that the situation didn't spiral downward. CNN: What's the first major foreign policy problem President Obama should address? Zakaria: Afghanistan. This is his war; the one he said was the right war. And it isn't going well. The Taliban is gaining strength and the central government is losing power and legitimacy. CNN: The Taliban is back? I thought we defeated them. Zakaria: The Taliban was not defeated: They retreated. They retreated into the rural areas of Pakistan. If you remember, the Taliban was born in Pakistan and supported by the Pakistani military as a tool to destabilize Soviet-controlled Afghanistan and India. Since they retreated, they have been able to slowly reassert their influence. Rory Stewart, who was just in Afghanistan, is on our show this week and he mentions that in the past, the Taliban only had a presence in southern Afghanistan. But they now can be found in Kabul. The fact they have such a presence in the capital, an area we considered secure, is very troubling. CNN: Why are they experiencing this support within the country? Zakaria: There are many reasons. But you have to remember, this is still a very poor country that is very fragmented. Security and the rule of law are missing and the Taliban provides it. Barney Rubin remarked that the first thing the Taliban creates when they go into an area is courts. It may not be the type of justice we would like; but for the Afghans it's better than the corrupt system that exists. Also, we shouldn't assume our image of the Taliban is correct. It is a very dynamic organization and changes. We may need to find a way to negotiate with them. CNN: Negotiate with the group that harbored al Qaeda? Zakaria: It may be a political necessity. Rory Stewart said, \"It's not 'what ought we do,' but 'what can we do.'\" He argues that at some point, the reality of troops and money will force us to revaluate our goals and we should start that process now. And there are many other crises America must deal with -- Iraq, Pakistan, sub-Saharan Africa, Iran -- so we can't be obsessed with Afghanistan. Barney Rubin added: The question is, whether we can separate the terrorist al Qaeda connections from the political issues of the Taliban. If that can occur, then it may be possible to find a solution in Afghanistan as [Gen. David] Petraeus helped broker in Iraq. We'll have to wait and see what Gen. Petraeus advises the president and what he decides to do. Done in [the president's] spare time, when he's not handling the economy. [Barnett Rubin is one of the nation's foremost experts on Afghanistan and Pakistan and the author of eight books. Rory Stewart, who lives in Kabul, has traveled extensively in Afghanistan and Iraq and written books about his experiences.] .", "b5687e4c60fe62a420ae0a076f4358892b54bc2a": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Pop star George Michael was cautioned by police in London after being arrested in public toilets on suspicion of possessing drugs, the UK's Press Association reported.

Danny Boyle, left, celebrates with actor Anil Kapoor, right, at the Mumbai premiere of \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" In the city where the movie was shot, Mumbai, India, the recognition came much quicker and more enthusiastically. The Mumbai premiere had all the makings of a scene from a Bollywood blockbuster: Musicians banged on traditional Indian drums as the cast and crew broke into dance on the red carpet in recognition of the 10 Academy Award nominations the film received Thursday. \"It feels like a million nominations,\" said director Danny Boyle, who earned one of the nominations.  Watch scenes from the Mumbai premiere \u00bb . Bollywood legend Anil Kapoor, who stars as the host of the Indian version of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" in the movie, said he was with Boyle when the nominations were announced. \"Danny had tears in his eyes, and I couldn't control myself,\" Kapoor said.  Watch Kapoor rave about the film \u00bb . But not everyone was celebrating. The film, about a Mumbai orphan seeking fame and love through the \"Millionaire\" game show, has stirred strong emotions among some Indian critics. They found the word \"slumdog\" in the title insulting and complained that the movie romanticizes poverty in India. Film critic Meenakshi Shedde said she was disappointed with the movie. \"What saddened me and annoyed me about the film is that it's a laundry list of India's miseries,\" she said. \"The poverty, the child labor, the beggary, the prostitution, that part of it was just banal, I thought.\" According to the Press Trust of India, Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan -- who once hosted the Indian version of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" -- recently cleared the air with Boyle regarding Bachchan's reported criticism of the Golden Globe-winning film. Such negativity was forgotten at the Mumbai premiere, which was attended by several Bollywood celebrities. They said the event marked a proud day for Indian cinema. Loveleen Tandan, who was the film's casting director, said the entire cast was exhilarated by news of the Academy Award nominations. As for her whether she believed \"Slumdog Millionaire\" had a chance at the Oscars, she expressed confidence. \"Now I can say it openly, I have high hopes,\" she said. \"I am sure there's a statue waiting for A.R.

The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta released this image of two men it claims are British hostages. The photos, sent in an e-mail by the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), show the men, identified as Robin Barry Hughes and Matthew John Maguire, standing on a dirt path wearing dirty shorts and flip flops. The pictures were \"recent,\" MEND said in a written statement, but it is unclear when they were taken. MEND, formed in 2005, has taken American and European oil workers hostages in the past. The group is calling for more of the African nation's oil wealth to be pumped into the region -- instead of going to foreign investors -- and the release of political prisoners. The United States Agency for International Development says more than 70 percent of Nigeria lives on less than a dollar a day -- the population is among the 20 poorest in the world. Nigeria's federal government and oil companies split oil profits roughly 60-40. The money is then supposed to make its way down to the local governments to fund various projects, but little money actually reaches its intended destination. The country's anti-corruption agency estimates between $300 billion to $400 billion has been stolen or wasted over the last 50 years. \"Our policy on kidnapping high value oil workers from Western Europe and North America remains unchanged and will continue to form an integral part of our pressure strategy in the emancipation struggle in 2009,\" MEND said in its statement.

MEND has been attacking oil pipelines in retaliation against government forces, limiting the amount of crude oil that can be exported.

Deciding whether to take advantage of them is another matter. Katie Parker and her husband, Damon Fodge, are going to India soon, but she had second thoughts about the trip. For many Americans, spending money on a getaway may not be a priority, a possibility -- or even the right thing to do -- amid thousands of layoffs, plunging home prices and shrinking portfolios. The general misery is even causing some who can afford a big trip to stay put. Take \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Brian Williams, who told the blog TVNewser this month that he and his family would skip a vacation in 2009 because it wouldn't seem appropriate during a time of hardship for so many people. \"We were going to try to get away, but it didn't feel right this year,\" Williams told the blog. Other Americans are jetting off, but they're having lots of second thoughts and are watching their wallets closely. Katie Parker, a Web designer who lives in Washington, is going to India next month to meet her husband on the last leg of his international business trip. Parker, 33, said she's excited about the vacation but apprehensive about spending $1,600 for her plane ticket in addition to lodging costs and other expenses during the two-week stay. \"Although I think my job is probably safe, you never really know,\" Parker said. \"Part of me thinks maybe we should have waited on this trip.\" She added, \"But I also feel like it's a once in a lifetime thing. I don't know when I'm going to get another chance to go to India so we're just going to do it.\" Parker and her husband, Damon Fodge, are usually frugal while traveling, staying in hostels and other inexpensive lodgings, she said, but they will be especially careful about spending money during this journey. Parker recalled feeling devastated after a layoff several years ago and said the possibility that it might happen again would be on her mind. Fear factor . The fear over what could happen is causing many people to put their lives on hold and hunker down because they don't feel in control, said Nancy Molitor, a clinical psychologist who practices in suburban Chicago, Illinois. \"There's a huge psychological component to any recession and this one, I think, in particular ... because it's gone on for so long,\" Molitor said. \"Anxiety is contagious.\" She also has heard from patients and friends who are affluent but who feel embarrassed about spending a lot of money on travel right now. Some have \"survivor's guilt\" and are downplaying their vacations instead of feeling excited about them, Molitor said. Brian Morton, a manager at a movie studio in Los Angeles, California, said talking about his travel plans with friends who are already unemployed -- and for whom travel is out of the question -- can be uncomfortable. \"You don't want to seem like you're bragging,\" he said. Morton, 37, is planning to spend at least $3,500 on a weeklong trip to Aruba this summer, even though there have been layoffs in his industry and he's not entirely sure his job is safe. \"I don't think I'm going to stop vacationing just because of the recession,\" he said. \"[But] I scrutinize my budget a little bit more. ... I want to get the most bang for my buck when it comes to hotels and that kind of thing.\" Where the deals are . Americans such as Morton who are willing to travel right now may find globe-trotting much more affordable than before.  Watch tips for finding the best airfares \u00bb . \"It's the best time in years to book a vacation; the deals are outstanding,\" said Genevieve Shaw Brown, senior editor at Travelocity. Hotels are offering some of the best values, especially in cities such as Las Vegas, Nevada; New York; and San Diego, California, she added. Bargains also can be found in Hawaii and Canada.  Watch how to find off-season deals \u00bb . For sea lovers, cruises are among of the best values this year, Shaw Brown said, though she urged people to consider the additional money they might have to spend on shore excursions, alcohol and other extras. Depending on where you go, the current travel discounts and incentives can mean that a vacation that might have cost $4,000 a year ago now costs $2,500, said Rey Alton, leisure marketing director at Travel Leaders/Almeda Travel in Houston, Texas. \"Some people say, 'I'm going to have to hold off until next year or maybe the year afterward,' but [those who want to travel now] are really the ones who are finding deals,\" he said. Mexico and the Caribbean are the biggest destinations on sale right now, he added. Molitor urged people to be mindful of their budgets but to try to avoid thinking they're stuck and have no options. \"If they get away to a vacation that they could afford, that could be very good for them,\" Molitor said. \"Some people are so down that they're missing opportunities.\"", "a430f3f657df3298d0a13e3a2fa2030622f8dcc5": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The global health community has been battling tuberculosis for more than a century, yet the disease still thrives. TB, which is contagious and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, spits or sneezes, strikes everywhere, but predominately affects the poor. The countries most affected by TB are the so-called high-burden ones, or the 22 countries identified by the World Health Organization that combined contribute 80 percent of the global burden of TB. Many health care systems in these nations don't have the resources, drugs and diagnostics to effectively deal with the disease, according to Dr. Mel Spigelman, director of research and development at the not-for-profit Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance). \"But even if we upgraded those systems, the lack of a really effective vaccine, the lack of better and faster drugs that shorten treatment to a reasonable time and the lack of good drugs for treating resistant disease -- make it hard for any health care system to effectively deal with the disease,\" he said. TB is usually treated with a combination of antibiotics administered for six to 24 months. But many patients fail to finish the long course of treatment, which has led to the emergence of deadly strains of the disease that can't be wiped out by the usual drugs. There hasn't been a new class of TB drugs developed in 40 years, Because it is mainly a disease of poverty, there hasn't really been a commercial market for new drugs, Spigelman noted. However, growing awareness of the disease has led to greater emphasis being placed on finding new treatments. Scientists at Rutgers University recently developed a group of antibiotic compounds that could be strong enough to combat even drug-resistant strains of TB. The project is exciting but is still in an early phase, according to Spigelman. He said it could be a good 10 years before a drug based on that research is available. \"We're going in the right direction, but unfortunately, the resources - given the magnitude of the problem - are still a small fraction of what is needed to have great chance of coming up with something that will turn the tide,\" he said.", "fd038ea3b53fa758e5bc8cc5932ad0264b63601d": "(CNN)  -- First trip to Malmo? Here's some insider advice to help you get the most out of your visit. Locals like to take a cold dip after a sauna at Ribersborgs Kallbadhus. Getting around town Most of Malmo's attractions are reachable by foot, but flat terrain and an abundance of cycle paths also make the city ideal to explore by bike. Rentals run around 120 kronor. You can also jump on the eco-friendly buses that criss-cross the city. Visit the tourist office at Central Station for maps. If you opt for a taxi, be sure to set the price of the trip with the driver before setting off. Ice cool  For more than a century, locals have been visiting the Ribersborgs Kallbadhus for a steam in the sauna followed by a dip in the Baltic. The swimming baths are open year-round. If you want to blend in with the locals, brave the elements and hit the baths in the winter for an icy plunge. A better time to visit for the less adventurous is in the summer, when the baths are open for sunbathing. Living green  As part of its post-industrial transformation, Malmo has become a leader in environmental design. The city's green achievements are reflected by the Bo01 housing development, a waterfront regeneration project with a focus on environmentally-friendly living. For the latest in green design, visit the Western Harbor and Augustenborg neighborhoods. For a more informed look, contact the local Environmental Department, which occasionally offers free guided tours of the city's ecologically sustainable areas. Around the Sound  Malmo is located just 35 minutes by train from the Danish capital of Copenhagen, and every day thousands travel between the two cities via the Oresund Bridge. Trains leave from Malmo every 20 minutes for most of the day. After midnight, service is less frequent. The two cities are part of Scandinavia's Oresund region -- the transnational area made up of southern Sweden and eastern Denmark. The best way to explore the Oresund region is with an \"Around the Sound\" ticket, which gives you access to all the trains you need to travel around the area, including the ride across the Oresund Bridge. You can make as many stops as you want as long as you travel in one direction. Tickets are good for two days and also get you discounts to the major attractions in the region. Prices depend on how far you travel and start from 199 kronor. Feasting on crayfish  Swedes are crazy about crayfish, and outdoor festivities celebrating the crustacean are held across the nation to mark the end of summer. In Malmo, head to Stortorget, the city's main square, for one of the biggest crayfish parties in the world. The massive celebration is held annually to kick off the popular Malmo Festival. Swedes like their crayfish cooked in salty water infused with dill. Blend in with the locals by eating it cold with toast and beer. To really get into the tradition, wash down the crayfish with akvavit, a Scandinavian kind of vodka.", "f8f23517b15ad186cacc607adc110a187a1df399": "(CNN) -- Just west of Seville in Spain, a sea of giant mirrors is reflecting the sun's energy to provide \"concentrated solar power\" (CSP) while illuminating the path to a new wave of green energy projects. Shining beacon: The concentrated solar power plant in Sanlucar, Spain is the first of its kind. The 624 carefully positioned mirrors reflect the sun's heat towards a 50 meter-tall central tower where it is concentrated and used to boil water into steam. The superheated steam is then used to turn a turbine that can produce up to 11 megawatts of electricity -- enough power for 6,000 homes -- according Solucar, the Spanish company that has built the power plant. While traditional solar panels, photovoltaic cells, convert the sun's power directly into electricity, CSP focuses power from a wide area and uses the vast heat generated to make electricity in a similar way to that produced from coal or oil. The Spanish tower, known as PS10, is the first phase of an ambitious development. By 2013 it is hoped that additional towers will create a \"solar farm\" with an output of 300 megawatts, which would be enough power for 180,000 homes, or equivalent to the entire population of nearby Seville. This $1.5 billion project is the largest commercial CSP station in the world -- so far. But many believe the technology will soon take off in areas of continuous hot sun and clear skies, offering a cheaper and more efficient alternative to photovoltaic cells, and bringing jobs and money to arid, often depressed areas. CSP also produces no greenhouses gasses and the only pollution is visual. The European Union has invested over $31 million in CSP research over the last ten years. At least 50 CSP projects have been given permission to begin construction across Spain. By 2015 the country may be producing two gigawatts of electricity from CSP, and employing thousands in the industry. One of the strengths of CSP is that it allows the construction of power stations on a scale that can match many fossil fuel based plants, and for an investment far less than that required to install the equivalent wattage of photovoltaic cells. There is also the possibility that production can keep going around the clock -- even when the sun has gone down. Solucar is currently testing technology at a plant near Granada that will pump 50 percent of the electricity generated in the day into the Spanish national grid, and use the other 50 percent to melt salt, which will then act as a kind of battery, storing the sun's power. When dusk falls, the heat stored in the molten salt can be used to generate power through the night. \"These technologies excite me,\" says Dr Jeff Hardy, Network Manager at the UK Energy Research Council. \"One of the real advantages is that you can get a decent sized power plant. \"The main challenge with the technology is working with extreme heat, but then a lot of the back-end is very similar to a traditional fossil-fuel generation; you are after all just dealing with water heated to make steam and drive a turbine.\" Concentrating on promoting CSP worldwide . As America looks to increase the contribution of renewables to its overall energy mix -- a key part of the Obama plan before the recession turbocharged Government funding for such \"green\" infrastructure projects -- the potential of CSP technology is obvious. The Spanish company responsible for the Sanlucar la Mayor plant has seen the potential and created Solucar Power, Inc., a subsidiary aiming to develop the market in the USA. There is already a huge Solar Energy Generating Systems' CSP station in the Mojave Desert, California; Spanish firm Acciona has built a plant near Las Vegas. Many more are surely on their way. One bold projection estimates that a single plant 100 miles by 100 miles located in the American South West could generate enough electricity for the whole country. It would obviously be a huge undertaking -- politically, financially and scientifically -- but it's not hard to imagine such a scheme finding a home in the nation's vast, empty quarter. Other equally arid areas may also find themselves transformed, and CSP may be able to offer valuable foreign earnings for drought-stricken Africa -- while giving Europe the green energy it needs. According to Dr Hardy the technology has a ready application, given the right political, environmental and economic context. \"Concentrated Solar Power is proven to do well in countries like Spain with a favorable government policies and the right climate,\" he says. \"I can certainly see the potential for extended networks linking together, and the idea of a North African grid linking renewable resources is a real possibility.\" Providing power, jobs and money . The Sahara, the world's largest desert, is fringed by some of the poorest countries in the world and the harsh environment has always been seen as a problem, with it's vast, waterless interior regularly reaching temperatures of over 45 degrees Celsius. But with large-scale CSP projects, suddenly all that empty space, with its year-round clear skies and hot sun, has a value that could transform local economies. It could potentially turn Africa into a net exporter of energy to power-hungry Europe, and perhaps even do for countries in North Africa what oil did for Saudi Arabia. The sums are dizzying. Estimates vary, but one projection from the German Aerospace Agency puts the amount of solar energy stored in just one per cent of the Sahara -- 35,000 square miles, or a piece of land slightly smaller than Portugal -- as having the potential to yield more power than all the world's existing power plants combined. Already Spanish firms are exporting CSP technology to Morocco and Algeria, and a British consortium, the Sahara Forest Project, is testing the technology in the deserts of Oman. Costs and benefits . However, there is a problem: at the moment costs are still very high. But they are falling as plants get bigger, the technology is perfected and economies of scale kick in. Even so, any plans to power Europe from the Sahara would require a vast infrastructure of CSP plants and cables laid across the Mediterranean -- requiring billions upon billions of dollars in investment. Such sums will only be possible through international co-operation on a huge scale. But on a smaller, more local scale a simple change in the way electricity generators are paid has been hugely effective in boosting renewable power. In Spain and other European countries investment has been encouraged by Governments creating what's known as a \"feed in tariff,\" which pays companies a premium for power sold to the national grid generated by renewable means for a fixed period of time. This enables investors to pay back up front costs more quickly. Where they have been introduced they have brought about a huge increase in renewable power: Germany has 200 times as much solar energy as Britain, generates 12 percent of its electricity from renewables, and has created a quarter of a million jobs in the sector. We're a long way from a future where the Sahara becomes the world's largest source of renewable electricity, and the American South West is covered in mirrors lighting and powering cities across the continent. There are many huge issues yet to resolve, but with small steps, we may be moving towards it.", "54ceb0e30fae291252237200f9bbd43e3c4f0ef9": "(CNN) -- Whether you're looking for a laid-back evening or want to party the night away, there are plenty of bars and clubs in Malmo to keep you entertained. Slagthuset is Scandinavia's biggest nightclub. Many nights start out in Lilla Torg, which boasts a wide array of restaurants and lounges. Sip cocktails at Victors -- if the weather's good, grab your drinks and head to the outdoor terrace. An equally popular hangout is nearby Moosehead, which has a more casual-woodsy vibe. Be sure to order the moose meat burger. A vibrant club scene exists in Malmo, which is home to Slagthuset (Jorgen Kocksgatan 7A) -- the largest nightclub in Scandinavia. Young dancers spread out over three dance floors at the club located behind Central Station. As its name suggests, Club Prive (Malmborgsgatan 7) draws an exclusive crowd. To chill in style, head to Torso Twisted (Vastra Varvsgatan 44) in the hip Western Harbor district. The restaurant serves gastronomic delights, and at night the lounge is decidedly cool. Indulge in one of the lavish cocktails or sample from the impressive wine list. You can also find the trendy set partying the evening away at Hipp (Kalendegatan 12). You can hang out in the restaurant or two bars or head straight to the pulsating nightclub. Satisfy your thirst for beer at Tva Krogare (Storgatan 35). The pub dishes up traditional Swedish fare and you'll likely find locals playing a game of darts. For a taste of British in Malmo, try The Bishop's Arms (Norra Vallgatan 62). Located inside the Hotel Savoy, it serves staples like fish and chips and has a wide assortment of beers available. If parties begin in Lilla Torg, they tend to end in Mollevangen. The bohemian neighborhood is dotted with bars that stay open well into the night. Prices in this area aren't as cheap as they once were but are still lower than compared to what you'll find in the city center. Local musicians hang out at hip Tempo Bar and Kok (Sodra Skolgatan 30). For something a little different, try Chokladfabriken (Bergsgatan 33), a club housed in an old chocolate factory that plays mostly hip hop, funk and soul. Malmo's passion for music makes it a great place to take in live performances. Kulturbolaget (Bergsgatan 18), one of the best venues for live acts, is a veritable Swedish institution. The club puts on about 220 rock concerts annually. Inkonst (Bergsgatan 29), a so-called culture house, puts on shows and club evenings. Jazz enthusiasts get into their groove at Jeriko (Spangatan 38), named such because it's housed in a former church. ....................  Malmo City Guide: .

Mourners with the coffin of a relative killed by a triple car bombing Wednesday in the city of Amara. Elsewhere an Iraqi was killed and five people were wounded Thursday when a car bomb detonated near the Italian Embassy in northern Baghdad's Adhamiya neighborhood, an Interior Ministry official said. And 11 people were detained in coalition raids targeting al Qaeda in Iraq and those who help foreign insurgents, the U.S. military said. Iraqi soldiers said 12 of the bodies found north of Baghdad were beheaded and four others were mutilated. The corpses, all male, were discovered Wednesday near Muqdadiya in Diyala province north of the capital, the official, from Diyala province, said on Thursday. He said police believe al Qaeda in Iraq left behind the mass grave. Diyala province -- which stretches north and east of the capital and borders Iran -- has been a major scene of fighting during the U.S. and Iraqi troop escalations this year. It is one of the Baghdad \"belts\" with a strong insurgent presence that have been targeted by coalition and Iraqi forces over the year. It is not the first mass grave found in and near Baghdad this autumn. Others include a mass grave of 17 Iraqi civilians believed kidnapped at fake police checkpoints, found under a house used by insurgents near Baquba, Diyala's provincial capital -- an area where al Qaeda in Iraq has had a strong presence. The decomposed bodies of 16 Iraqi civilians believed killed by al Qaeda in Iraq terrorists were found in early December in a shelter in central Baghdad's Fadl neighborhood. And U.S. and Iraqi troops found 22 corpses buried in the region around Iraq's Lake Tharthar, northwest of Baghdad, in both Anbar and Salaheddin provinces. Meanwhile the Italian Embassy confirmed the bombing in northern Baghdad's Adhamiya neighborhood which killed one person but had no further details about the incident. Three police were among the wounded when the parked car blew up, the official said. A predominantly Sunni neighborhood, Adhamiya is one of the areas in Baghdad where an \"awakening\" movement has been created to maintain security. The awakening movement is the name for the anti-al-Qaeda in Iraq Sunni groups that have emerged in Iraq over the year. The detention of the 11 people in coalition raids targeting netted, the U.S. military said, an al Qaeda in Iraq leader north of Hawija, believed to be responsible for facilitating finances and logistics for the terrorist network in the area\". Five others were detained. A \"wanted individual\" and three others were detained in Mosul and another person was seized in Samarra. \"Foreign terrorists who come to Iraq to support al Qaeda will find no safe haven from which they can operate,\" said Cmdr.

Don't haunt the person you dumped by sending them a birthday card. While it's ideal when both sides exit the relationship with dignity, it's much easier to be the Gracious Ex when you're the dumper. After all, it was your bright idea to break up. You've had time to wrap your head around it, and really, who are you kidding -- you probably have a replacement lined up already. So we're going to start with you, the breaker-upper, because your list of \"How Not to Be\" is a lot shorter. Without further adieu, you definitely should not: . \u2022 Refuse to be the bad guy.

Don't coo and hover, your exaggerated frown telegraphing their status as the booted party to any and all in the area. Getting dumped is humiliating enough without the insincere theatrics. \u2022 Rebound with a friend or family. The ultimate in sketchy ex behavior would have to be dumping a dude to get to his cousin (or brother). Next up is his best friend.

Washington intern Chandra Levy's body was found a year after she disappeared in 2001. \"I got a call from the Washington police department, just to give me a heads up that there's a warrant out for the arrest,\" Levy said. Police Chief Cathy Lanier of the Metropolitan Police Department did not reveal the suspect's name when she contacted the parents on Friday, Levy said. She said police told her they have \"enough evidence to convict somebody.\" A source close to the investigation told CNN the suspect was Ingmar Guandique, who is serving a 10-year prison sentence for two assaults in Washington's Rock Creek Park that occurred around the time of Levy's disappearance. Levy's remains were found in the park.  View a timeline of her disappearance \u00bb . The source would not speak on the record because the investigation is ongoing and the arrest warrant had not been finalized. A California native working as an intern for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Levy, 24, disappeared May 1, 2001. Her remains were found in May 2002 by a man walking his dog in a remote area of the park. The source said authorities are working to finalize the arrest warrant. Asked about reports that Guandique, a laborer from El Salvador, told a fellow inmate he killed Levy, the source said Guandique \"was running his mouth.\" Guandique has been imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution - Victorville, a medium-security facility north of San Bernardino, California, an official there confirmed to CNN on Saturday.  Watch CNN's Mike Brooks discuss Guandique's background \u00bb . He has denied any involvement in her death, the Washington Post reported Saturday. Guandique was mentioned last year in a Washington Post article about the killing. \"It's a bittersweet situation for me as the mother of a daughter who is no longer here. I want justice. I want to know that the person who did it is in jail and will not do it to anybody else,\" Levy said. \"Every day the elephant is there. Every day you get a knot in your stomach. It doesn't go away. It's a life sentence for the families and relatives that miss their loved ones. We have a life sentence of hurt.\" Referring to the impending arrest, Chandra's father told CNN affiliate KXTV that Lanier didn't say when an announcement would be made, but \"she said it would be really soon.\" \"She didn't say the name yet, but we think we know who it is. I don't want to say until it's official, though,\" the father said. The search for Levy and massive publicity that accompanied it stemmed largely from her connection to Rep. Gary Condit, D-California. Condit and Levy, who was from Condit's district, had an affair, and police questioned Condit many times in connection with her disappearance. Police never named Condit as a suspect. Condit, a member of Congress since 1989, lost the 2002 Democratic primary and left office at the end of his term. He later reportedly moved to Arizona. \"For the Levy family, we are glad they are finally getting the answers they deserve. For my family, I am glad that their years of standing together in the face of such adversity have finally led to the truth,\" Condit told WJLA on Saturday. Condit's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, blamed police and media attention on Condit for delays in the arrest. Police never named him as a suspect. \"It is a tragedy that the police and media obsession with former Congressman Condit delayed this result for eight years, and caused needless pain and harm to the families involved,\" Lowell said. \"This should give the Levys the answer and closure they deserve, and remove the unfair cloud that has hung over the Condits for too long.\" CNN's Carol Cratty, Karen Zuker, Justine Redman and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.", "c0499bc05f812ae41420f75cf532ad8e7ddb2f69": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso met with President Barack Obama on Tuesday making him the first head of state to be hosted by the new administration. Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso steps off his Boeing 747 at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland Monday. It was a long trip -- 6,800 miles (11,000 km) -- for a short meeting -- one hour -- and happened as Obama was preparing his first address to a joint session of Congress. Sitting next to Aso in the White House, Obama said: \"The friendship between the United States and Japan is extraordinarily important. \"It is for that reason that the prime minister is the first foreign dignitary to visit me in the Oval Office.\" Obama said the U.S.-Japanese alliance would be crucial in solving international problems including climate change. \"We think we have to work together, not only on issues relating to the Pacific Rim, but throughout the world,\" Obama added.

We will have to work hand in hand. \"I think we are the only two nations which are powerful enough to solve those very critical, vital issue,\" Aso said. Japan's Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura said that being the first to visit the Obama White House was an indication of the priority the new president placed on the relationship. Another topic likely to have been on the agenda was Japan's Asian neighbor North Korea, which U.S. intelligence says is preparing to test a long-range missile.

Goldfish may have delivered a dubious dietary aid -- tapeworms. So it stands to reason that dieting has been around just as long.

His advice? Fat people should move to more arid climes. Improbable side effects . The namesake of the graham cracker -- ironically now an integral part of that deliciously fattening treat, the 'smore -- was a Presbyterian minister who claimed that overeating could not only make you fat, it could make you lecherous, too. In the 1830s, Sylvester Graham ran health retreats for like-minded parishioners featuring a strict meat-free, incredibly bland diet. Chew yourself thin . Horace Fletcher, a turn of the century San Francisco art dealer, became known as the Great Masticator after he claimed he lost more than 40 pounds by chewing his food until it was essentially liquefied and spitting out all the bits that weren't. Fletcher's scheme became incredibly popular -- novelist Henry James and industry titan John D. Rockefeller were reportedly fans, as was John Harvey Kellogg. Kellogg, of the cereal fame, was a health nut who ran a sanitarium in Michigan, where he encouraged his visitors to \"Fletcherize\" with a little song he wrote called \"Chew Chew.\" Mental Floss: How cereal transformed American culture . The parasite diet . In the early part of the 20th century, the weight loss industry allegedly found a tiny little helper in the form of a tiny little parasite -- the noble tapeworm. According to product advertisements of the day, tapeworms were being sold in pill form as a weight loss tool. While whether or not those pills actually contained a real live tapeworm is certainly debatable, however, there is evidence that jockeys, who frequently needed to lose a lot of weight fast, would try to induce tapeworms. Another favorite weight loss tool of the Lilliputian equestrians: Burying themselves in piles of horse manure, which acted as a kind of natural sauna. Introducing the calorie . In 1918, Dr. Lulu Hunt Peters introduced a new word to the world lexicon --\"calorie\" (may she be forever cursed for it). Peters' book, \"Diet and Health, With a Key to Calories,\" which helpfully included a phonetic spelling of the word \"calorie,\" as so many people were unfamiliar with it, sold more than 2 million copies and established calorie-counting as the framework of a good health. This diet regime wasn't particularly dubious, but it did lend a potentially dangerous new tool to those looking for a way to quantify and reduce their food intake. Case in point: The Scarsdale Diet of 1979, a strict 700-calorie a day diet that works -- because you're starving. Mental Floss: Quiz: Which item has more calories? The goldfish diet . OK, this one wasn't so much about weight loss as it was fame gain, but in 1939, it was a fad that swept the nation. Like most good things, it all started with a bet -- a Harvard University undergrad won $10 after swallowing an innocent fishy. The story spread from there, prompting a countrywide goldfish slaughter. Goldfish swallowing became so popular that not only were pet stores running out of the indigestible comestibles, but the New York Times published warnings from doctors that swallowing goldfish, which are known to carry tapeworms and other parasites, could be very harmful to one's health. The nicotine diet . By the middle of the 20th century, dieting had become such a major economic, social and cultural force in the Western world that cigarette companies, not wanting to miss the money boat, jumped on board promoting cigarettes as a weight-loss tool. It's a belief that persists today -- ask any supermodel. The master cleanse . In the 1940s, nutrition guru Stanley Burroughs created the Master Cleanse, a fast during which the dieter subsists solely on a mixture of cayenne pepper, fresh-squeezed lemon juice, maple syrup and water. The Master Cleanse is still popular today, especially among anorexics and aspiring anorexics, despite the fact that most nutritionists and doctors say that \"detoxing\" is a nonsensical and potentially harmful idea. The Sleeping Beauty diet . Then there's the Sleeping Beauty Diet, a regime that allows the dieter to literally sleep off the pounds while under heavy sedation for several days. Elvis was reportedly a fan of that one, right about the time when he was having a little trouble squeezing into those trademark white jump suits, as was a character in the landmark beach read, \"Valley of the Dolls.\" Mental Floss: 7 simple rules for how to take a nap . The monotony diets . The 20th century also brought us back to a concept allegedly pioneered by William the Conqueror -- the single food or drink diet. There's the Grapefruit Diet, which alleges that eating a lot of grapefruit and drinking a lot of grapefruit juice, in conjunction, of course, with a very low-calorie diet, is the way to weigh less; the Cabbage Soup Diet, which is said to cause serious gas with a side of nausea; the Popcorn Diet, which is pretty much undercut by all the tasty things one puts on popcorn to make it palatable; and the Chocolate Diet, which, though tempting, is just plain silliness. Memorable dieting paraphernalia . And let's not forget about the gadgets that went along with these suspect food fads, like the Vision-Dieter Glasses, which made food look unappealing, or the Mini-Fork system, which encouraged people to eat smaller portions by supplying them with -- you guessed it -- smaller forks. Or how about slimming soaps, popular in the 1930s, which promised dieters that they could just wash the fat away? And then there's the perennially popular vibrating machine, which promised to melt off pounds by a few minutes of intense body vibration -- and which is actually enjoying a comeback now at gadgetry stores like Brookstone.

Bush and his wife, Barbara, made an impromptu visit to the White House's press briefing room and told reporters how much they'll miss the building. Ex-President George H.W. Bush says he'll miss coming and going from the White House. \"We will miss coming and going, but it's time to move on,\" said the former president, who was a frequent visitor during his son's two terms in office. \"The Bushes are going to a happy life.\" When a reporter suggested that perhaps one of their other sons, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, will take the White House someday, the former president smiled. \"Maybe Jeb will do something. I'd like to see him try,\" the former president said. Barbara Bush, who was first lady from 1989 to 1993, said the hardest part of the night was saying goodbye to the White House residence staff a second time. \"In tears twice,\" she said, her eyes red. She added that she and her husband are looking forward to attending Tuesday's inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama. \"Very exciting day,\" she said. In addition to the inauguration, the former first couple was to attend a final dinner at the White House with current President Bush, first lady Laura Bush and the first couple's two daughters, Barbara and Jenna. As the former first couple left the briefing room, some reporters and photographers spontaneously started clapping out of respect.  Your view of history . The ex-president, who was using a long walking stick to get around, quipped, \"You didn't clap when I was president, what the hell is going on?\"", "ac9c2b30819230c7d46f786d33dc9a94974a9ba7": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former GOP presidential nominee John McCain warned Wednesday that the United States is losing the war in Afghanistan. Sen. John McCain recommended expanding the Afghan army to between 160,000 and 200,000 troops. The Arizona senator, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that while he approved of President Obama's recent decision to send 17,000 more troops to the country, he believed an additional allied military and civilian surge would be necessary to prevent it from once again becoming an al Qaeda safe haven. The Obama administration is conducting a review of overall U.S. policy in the troubled Islamic republic, the president said in his joint address to Congress on Tuesday. \"With our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat al Qaeda and combat extremism,\" Obama said Tuesday. \"Because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens halfway around the world. We will not allow it.\" But McCain said on Wednesday, \"When you aren't winning in this kind of war, you are losing. And, in Afghanistan today, we are not winning.\" He delivered his remarks at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think tank. McCain claimed that while the situation in Afghanistan is \"nowhere near as dire as it was in Iraq,\" the number of insurgent attacks had spiked in 2008 and violence had increased more than 500 percent in the past four years. Growing portions of the country \"suffer under the influence of the Taliban,\" he added. McCain's comments echoed those of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who acknowledged last Friday that the United States is facing a \"very tough test\" in Afghanistan. \"But I'm sure we will rise to the occasion the way we have many times before,\" Gates told a news conference in Krakow, Poland, where NATO defense ministers were meeting. McCain said that the U.S. was winning the war in Afghanistan through early 2005, when some troops were withdrawn and \"our integrated civil-military command structure was disassembled and replaced by a Balkanized and dysfunctional arrangement.\" A Vietnam War veteran, former prisoner of war and longtime member of the Armed Services Committee, McCain said that while he knows Americans \"are weary of war ... we must win [in Afghanistan]. The alternative is to risk that country's return to its previous function as a terrorist sanctuary, from which al Qaeda could train and plan attacks against America.\" Among other things, McCain stated that the U.S. needs to establish a larger military headquarters capable of executing \"the necessary planning and coordination for a nationwide counterinsurgency campaign.\" He also said plans to expand the Afghan army from 68,000 to 134,000 troops were insufficient. He recommended expanding the Afghan army to between 160,000 and 200,000 troops. At the same time, he said, the U.S. needs to boost the country's nonmilitary assistance to help strengthen \"its [civilian] institutions, the rule of law, and the economy in order to provide a sustainable alternative to the drug trade.\" Southern Afghanistan provides about two thirds of the world's opium and heroin. Over the years, those two drugs have served as a major source of revenue for the insurgency, including the Taliban. McCain warned that, even if his recommendations are adopted, the violence in Afghanistan is \"likely to get worse before it gets better. The scale of resources required to prevail will be enormous.\" The timetable, he concluded, \"will be measured in years, not months.\"", "772858186d456cbd32232325ba43db6ad669870c": "(CNN) -- After almost 10 months, the FBI has zeroed in on a suspect in the case of missing Florida pilot Robert Wiles, who may have been kidnapped for ransom. Missing Florida pilot Robert Wiles is thought to have been kidnapped for ransom. \"We're close to solving the case,\" said FBI special agent David Couvertier. He would not elaborate. Agents also would not identify the suspect, and they said the person is not in custody. Investigators would only reveal that the \"key suspect\" is in Florida, either in Orlando, Lakeland or Melbourne. \"They're holding that back in hopes of getting additional information,\" said Couvertier. The FBI says it's also looking at several persons of interest in those same three Florida cities. Wiles, 27, was last seen in the family's aircraft maintenance business, National Flight Services, at Lakeland Linder Regional Airport on April 1, 2008. The day Wiles disappeared, he left behind his bags, his computer, and even his car. His father says the next day, Wiles was supposed to be on a flight out of Orlando. He never showed up. Two days after he vanished, Wiles' father, Thomas, received a ransom note. It demanded money and threatened to harm Robert Wiles if the terms weren't met. Wiles' parents said they tried to comply but heard nothing back. Nearly a year later, the FBI says their investigation shows that those involved \"were very familiar with Robert's work, Robert's personal information and had knowledge of his parent's personal affairs.\" Agents say they've tracked down leads in nine U.S. cities and as far away as Thailand where National Flight Services also does business. The Ohio-based company services aircraft in 50 countries and has been in business since 1972. Investigators are reaching out to the public in hopes of sparking any additional information about Wiles to \"close the loop,\" Couvertier said. Investigators want to talk with \"people who knew about his work routine, who might know someone who was obsessed with him, who was upset or jealous of him, or complained about him, anything that might be helpful,\" said Couvertier. Wiles' parents told CNN they hope their son Robert is still alive. \"That is our hope until proven otherwise, ' said his mother, Pamela. \"We don't know what happened to him. We don't know where he is. We just hope somebody will call and tell us what their needs are,\" she added. \"Sometimes, I stay up late and get up early and try to come up with any scenarios to make sense of this,\" said Wiles' father. \"I have my very low moments when I think I'll never see him again, \" he added. Occasionally, Wiles' mother says she plays back a voicemail message her son left her shortly before he disappeared. It said \"Hey, mom. It's Robert. I just wanted to call and thank you for sending that stuff down to me. And I hope you have a good weekend, ... and I'll talk to you later.\" \"I still listen to it, and it breaks my heart,\" said Pamela Wiles. The Wiles are still offering a $250,000 reward for information about their son and arrest of those responsible for his disappearance. \"But Tom and I don't think you can put a dollar on his head,\" said Pamela Wiles. \"We want to provide them with security and a new life, if that's what they need,\" she added. His father doesn't think whoever is responsible is working alone. He says his son is too strong to have left willingly or without knowing who his alleged captors are. Anyone with information is asked to contact the FBI. Wiles' parents have a message for the FBI's unidentified suspect. \"I would say to him 'come forward and tell the truth and we hold no personal animosity,'\" said Pamela Wiles. \"Someone made a bad mistake. It's up to God to forgive him.\"", "cc68600c045188dd1c1889e47a7b79c95482ce26": "(CNN) -- It was the late 1960s and Tom Repasky was in a fog. H. Michael Karshis owns thousands of albums but Steely Dan's \"Can't Buy a Thrill\" holds a special place in his heart. \"I was trying to discover who I was, what I was and what I was doing here,\" he said. In 1963, at age 14, Repasky was on a field trip with his seminary when he and another student accidentally fell down a steep ledge while throwing rocks at upperclassmen. A tree broke his friend's fall, but Repasky was not so lucky. Repasky awoke in the hospital, but says he was unable to remember even the smallest detail of his past. \"It was as if I didn't exist before that time,\" he said. This experience scarred him, to the point that he was asked to leave the seminary by the end of the year. \"I clearly was not the same person,\" he said. \"After my near-death experience, there was this prolonged period of not being able to relate to reality very well.\" Several years after his accident, Repasky first heard the Moody Blues song \"Nights in White Satin.\" \"After I heard these lyrics, I thought, 'They know what I'm feeling.' \" He sought out their album \"Days of Future Passed.\" He was particularly drawn to the lyrics from their song \"Dawn is a Feeling:\" \"You are here today; no future fears; this day will last 1,000 years, if you want it to.\" Repasky, who now lives in Danville, Pennsylvania, and is an artist, often goes back to this album. \"When I hear the music, it brings me to the point of realizing that I had experienced life and I could be alive, and it brings me great joy in knowing that.\" The part of \"Nights in White Satin\" where the words \"I love you\" are repeated always moves Repasky, even 40 years later. iReport.com: Watch Repasky tell his story . Repasky is one of many iReporters who shared the album that first hooked them and has stayed with them throughout their lives. H. Michael Karshis owns about 3,200 albums, but one holds a special place in his heart: \"Can't Buy a Thrill\" by Steely Dan. Even though his mother worked in a record store in 1973 (which helps explain the number of albums he owns), \"Can't Buy a Thrill\" was the first one he bought with his own money, at the age of 12. \"Reelin' in the Years\" was the song that hooked him. \"It's almost an ode to a distant past,\" he said. \"I remember listening to that before I was 17 and thinking about how old 17 was. It has a different connotation and meaning the older you get, but it's still a poignant, relevant song.\" Whenever Karshis moves into a new home, one of the first things he does is to crank up the stereo and play the album. \"It's just one of those timeless albums and it's hard to describe how it affects me.\" Karshis, who works as a graphic artist in San Antonio, Texas, thinks the cover of the album has influenced his artwork. \"I'm not saying I got it all from the Steely Dan cover, but it's amazing how it permeates everything I do now.\" iReport.com: Karshis talks about one album in his massive collection . Sal Steels of Denver, Colorado, first rocked out to Van Halen's album \"1984\" about 20 years ago, and hasn't stopped since. In fact, he demonstrated the way he feels when the song \"Panama\" starts in a video for iReport.com. For Steels, \"1984\" is \"one of those you have in the car. It's one you make a backup CD for.\" He listens to it constantly and considers \"Panama\" his favorite song of all time. iReport.com: Sal Steels rocks out to Van Halen . Not all iReporters listen to their most influential album regularly. Diane Holder of Ann Arbor, Michigan, had fond memories of Pink Floyd's \"The Wall,\" but it had been a while since she had heard it. \"Twice before, I went back and looked at something that I cherished as a memory from my childhood, [and] the results were not very good,\" she said. Despite her hesitation, she listened to the album online. In this case, she was pleasantly surprised by how well it stood the test of time, and she ended up downloading the whole thing. \"For me, that is remarkable. I can count on my fingers the albums I have bought.\" Jill Pearson of Atlanta, Georgia, is such a fan of Elton John's \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" that she created a video quiz for the iReport.com community. Pearson has been going back to the album off and on for years. \"It takes me back to my college days and he's just one of my favorite performers,\" she said. iReport.com: Take the Elton John quiz . For some iReporters, one album opened their eyes to something new. Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" was not the first album Tony Bernez bought, but he considers it an important work, not just for himself, but for his generation. He considers it \"one of the most ground-breaking, consciousness-raising and inspiring concept albums of its time, or any other time, for that matter.\" \"It marked a transcendent change from the Motown R&B songs that Marvin had previously released, and it spoke to the pain, injustice, and uncertainty of the turbulent 1960s and early 1970s,\" he said. \"I just listened to it yesterday, and it still moves me in a very special way.\" For Lulis Leal, one album completely changed her philosophy of life. She had not been exposed to Rush's music before their ninth album, \"Signals,\" was released, but when she heard the song \"Subdivisions,\" Neal Peart's drumming had her hooked. Leal listened to more of Rush's music and soon learned that the band was influenced by author Ayn Rand. After reading her novels, Leal began to adapt Rand's philosophy into her own life. Fred Thorne was a big fan of much of the popular music of the 1980s when he was 14, but the moment he heard R.E.M.'s song \"Fall on Me\" on alternative radio, he was determined to own the album \"Life's Rich Pageant.\" After buying not just one, but three R.E.M. albums, his musical tastes changed forever. Thorne went on to play in bands for 18 years. \"If you ask me, R.E.M. is the godfather of indie sound.\" iReport.com: Fred Thorne pays tribute to R.E.M. Whether it's nostalgia, an appreciation of great songwriting, or even a life-changing experience, music has certainly done a lot to help these iReporters throughout their lives. \"Music can be that one thing that can bring a bright spot to anyone's life,\" said iReporter Crystal Dickson. \"Where would we be without it?\"", "ca4d998615f4d48fa792b3bba65c41bcb513ffb3": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than two dozen guests joined first lady Michelle Obama at the president's speech to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night. Leonard Abess Jr. was recognized by President Obama during Tuesday's State of the Nation speech. One person on the first lady's guest list was Leonard Abess Jr., a Miami banker who received a $60 million bonus from the proceeds from the sale of shares of City National Bank in Florida and gave it out to his 399 workers and 72 former workers. During his speech, President Obama said Abess didn't tell anyone about his generosity, but when the local newspaper found out, Abess simply said, \"I knew some of these people since I was 7 years old. I didn't feel right getting the money myself.\" Abess demonstrates the kind of \"responsibility\" the president has called for from high-profile financial CEOs, the White House said. Obama contrasted Abess' story with the greed that he said got the country into the problems it faces now. \"CEOs won't be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks, or buy fancy drapes, or disappear on a private jet. Those days are over,\" Obama said. Obama also referenced in his speech an eighth-grader who wrote a letter to members of Congress appealing for help in rebuilding her deteriorating school. Ty'Sheoma Bethea, a student at the J.V. Martin Junior High School in Dillon, South Carolina, was invited after a letter she sent lawmakers appealing for help rebuilding her school made its way to President Obama. Obama talked about the school during his first news conference earlier in February as evidence of crumbling schools across the country. Other guests of the first lady Tuesday night included injured Afghanistan veteran Spc. Jonathan N. James, equal pay advocate Lilly Ledbetter and Blake Jones, the co-founder and president of a solar electric company. The president and first lady  also invited Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas -- one of the president's key Republican allies among the nation's governors in passing the massive $787 billion stimulus bill -- and Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, a key Democratic governor whose state is among the hardest hit by the economic downturn. The practice of inviting guests to sit in the House Gallery is a tradition dating back to 1982 when president Ronald Reagan recognized Lenny Skutnick -- a good Samaritan who pulled a survivor out of the frozen Potomac River in Washington after an Air Florida plane crashed into the 14th Street Bridge. Since then, presidential administrations steadily increased the number of invitees to the first lady box, often including prominent athletes and celebrities, citizen heroes, members of the military, and individuals likely to benefit from policies proposed by the president. It has also become customary for the president to acknowledge a handful of guests sitting in the box during his speech, especially those who have a particularly compelling story or illustrate a point he is trying to make. Earlier Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an expansive guest list of her own, including hero-U.S. Airways pilot Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger and several other crew members of flight 1549. CNN's Alexander Mooney contributed to this report.", "ec7ca8313c5a1edf5c84d05cd96913777c4c6b84": "(CNN) -- Basketball is often viewed as a game of opposing sides. But one man is using the game to bring young Catholic and Protestant men together on the same team in Belfast, Northern Ireland. After graduating college, Michael Evans coached basketball at two high schools in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Former college basketball player, Michael Evans, 26, in partnership with another basketball player, Dave Cullen, created the organization Full Court Peace to help forge friendships between between schools in the divided communities. He spoke with CNN's Nicole Lapin about how Full Court Peace works. The following is an edited transcript of the interview. Lapin: So you wanted to use basketball as a bridge but you started Full Court Peace almost to dupe these youngsters into working together? Evans: Yea that's one way to put it. I think what I did was I just coached basketball separately in two high schools. And, uh, on the opposite sides of these walls I've been talking about. And I got roughly five on each side to latch on to me. These 16-year-old boys. You know, they came from broken homes and I showed them loyalty. That's what coaches do, is show their players loyalty and the kids latched on to me, so much that I was able to sell the idea of making an integrated team out of their enemies and it was a complete success.  Watch more on Michael Evan's organization \u00bb . Lapin: They didn't think that they were going to work with the other side. Like Robert, for example, one of your players who is Protestant. What did he think when he was going to work with a Catholic team? Evans:That was a pretty discouraging moment throughout the whole process of forming that team. I told Robert the news and he shunned me. He couldn't believe that the time I'd spent with him alone was really just basically me trying to convince him to join this team. I thought I might have lost him. Lapin:  Now he's also friends with the other side to this day. There was a little bit of hesitation at first, I know they did speak, but are they still friends? Evans:They are still friends. I recently went back to Belfast and had dinner with a lot of them all together. And the ones that couldn't meet for the integrated dinner asked about their team mates. The neighborhoods are too divided for them to visit each other so they communicate a lot online through bebo.com which is a social networking site over there. And they keep up with each other. They're not bashful about having pictures of each other, arm-in-arm on their social networking sites, and they communicate through me about each other because I'm in touch with all of them. Lapin: So that's amazing, Michael. How do you think you do this? How does sports diplomacy, which is really what this is, succeed where world leaders, prime ministers and presidents have failed? Evans: I mean just because a politician, two politicians come together and say they agree on something, it doesn't mean that the people on the ground are going to be agreeing on it. And most importantly the youth that are growing up in these environments, that doesn't mean that they agree with what's going on. So that's sort of just a face to the whole solution. I think what sport does, namely basketball, is that you put kids in a small, very small group together and they're forced to communicate in order to succeed; in order to win. And then the coaches role is very unique in that the kids all bond over having one voice and one person telling them what to do and guiding them along and helping them with success.", "8b6181d9d0b038bd231b428cc5650c0dc34b0cc9": "(CNN) -- Fighting has prompted thousands of people in the southern part of Sudan's Darfur region to seek security and shelter at a refugee camp in the northern part of the war-torn area, according to the United Nations. A member of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) stands guard near the Sudan-Chad border in 2007. The U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that fighting in Muhajeria and Shearia between Sudanese government forces, and the rebel Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), drove over 15,000 people north to the Zam Zam camp. The water supply to the camp is becoming strained with displaced people arriving there every day, OCHA said Wednesday. The government of Sudan has waged a brutal counter-insurgency against militias for the past six years, a war that some international critics have characterized as genocide. An estimated 300,000 people in the western Sudanese region have been killed through combat, disease or malnutrition, according to the United Nations. An additional 2.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of fighting among rebels, government forces and the violent Janjaweed militias. Fighting continues in the region despite the JEM and local government signing a \"goodwill and confidence-building\" agreement earlier in February, according to the U.N. The U.N.-African Union allied peacekeeping mission (UNAMID) will begin building a new community police center near Zam Zam in the next two weeks, the U.N. announced Saturday. The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength. Last year, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was charged with genocide by the International Criminal Court for the government's campaign of violence in Darfur. Under pressure to end the fighting, Al-Bashir in November agreed to an immediate and unconditional cease-fire in Darfur. But the rebel Justice and Equality Movement was not included in the case-fire talks.

Schools and kindergartens were closed in Nahariya and the nearby town of Shlomi, the Israel Defense Forces reported. \"What happened in the south [of Lebanon] is a violation of Resolution 1701 and is rejected by Lebanon,\" Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said, referring to the U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. In a statement issued by his office, Siniora said he has asked Lebanese authorities to investigate the attack alongside troops from the U.N. peacekeeping force deployed along the border. He also condemned the Israeli retaliatory strikes, which the Lebanese military said inflicted no casualties.  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour discuss rocket attack \u00bb . There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, which came as Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, to the south, entered a 13th day. The Israeli campaign in Gaza is aimed at halting rocket fire from the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory. Israel fought a similar battle against the Lebanese Shiite Muslim militia Hezbollah in 2006, during which Hezbollah rained rockets on cities in Israeli's north for a month before a cease-fire was reached. But Hezbollah has kept a tight rein on its forces in southern Lebanon since the cease-fire, and a number of Palestinian factions operate in southern Lebanon as well. Andrea Tenenti, a spokesman for UNIFIL, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, said the rockets appear to have been fired from a point about 4.5 miles east of Naqoura, where the peacekeepers are headquartered. \"We've been intensifying our patrols on the ground in order to prevent any further incident,\" Tenenti said. He said UNIFIL's commander, Maj. Gen. Claudio Graziano, is in \"constant and close contact\" with both sides \"and has urged maximum restraint in order to prevent any escalation of the situation.\" CNN's Michal Zippori in Jerusalem and Cal Perry and Nada Husseini in Beirut contributed to this report.", "32f512e2e5e3ced7649faf6bccd2a9b274541626": "MANILA, Philippines (CNN) -- Dramatically played out on live television, an opposition politician and rebel military officers surrendered to government forces after taking over a luxury hotel in Manila. \"We're going out for the sake of the safety of everybody,\" Philippines Sen.

High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday. Violence continued this week in Mogadishu between Somali Islamist fighters and African Union soldiers. They are part of more than a million residents who have been displaced by fighting, including 100,000 who fled to neighboring countries last year, according to the United Nations. Most of those returning are families from Somalia's southern and central regions, areas that are suffering from drought and renewed fighting, according to UNHCR. They are now living in neighborhoods in northern Mogadishu that had been abandoned over the past two years of conflict, the U.N. agency said. Part of the reason displaced Somalis may be braving the violence and returning to the war-torn capital city is because of the recent pullout of Ethiopian troops, who were blamed for indiscriminately killing civilians in Mogadishu, a Somali journalist said. \"The AU [African Union] and [Somali] government forces only defend in their positions, they don't move around,\" according to Mohammed Amiin Adow. \"This may reduce the fear of the civilians that their homes may be raided. \"During the Ethiopian presence, it was different: When their bases were attacked, they used to come and carry out search operations in which civilians may be detained, killed or wounded.\" Adow also said another reason refugees may be returning is the bad conditions at the camps for internally displaced Somalis. \"People had been living in very poor conditions in the makeshift camps on the road between Mogadishu and Afgooye for the last two years,\" Adow said. \"So that is I think why people are returning.\" Those returning to Mogadishu will have limited access to basic necessities, a problem that is compounded by the scarcity of international aid agencies, who have fled Somalia because of the violence, UNHCR spokesman William Spindler said Friday. \"UNHCR is not encouraging returns to Mogadishu at this juncture, as the security situation is volatile and the conditions are certainly not conducive,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, we are preparing to help returnees or those who wish to return in the near future, in the hope that the security situation will improve.\"", "1c0683c2821bb2415b3a1560b3df68f596d68a63": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The notorious Iraq prison once called Abu Ghraib has reopened under Iraqi government control. And the Ministry of Justice has launched a public-relations campaign to show it has changed since the days when prisoners were tortured there -- first under Saddam Hussein, and later by American troops. The Iraqi Ministry of Justice gave journalists an inside look at the prison formerly known as Abu Ghraib. It is now called Baghdad Central Prison, and has water fountains, a freshly planted garden and a gym -- complete with weights and sports teams' jerseys on the walls. Under Saddam Hussein, tens of thousands of Iraqis were thrown behind bars here. There were horrific stories of torture, abuse, execution without trial. In 2004, the prison was once again thrown into the international spotlight, this time because of abuse by U.S. troops.  Watch how the prison has been revamped \u00bb . Detainees were photographed in degrading positions, as Americans posed next to them smiling. The images -- naked prisoners stacked on top of each other, or being threatened by dogs, or hooded and wired up as if for electrocution -- caused outrage around the world when they were leaked to the news media in May 2004. Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, commander of the Abu Ghraib prison at the time, was demoted in rank to colonel because of the scandal. Seven low-ranking guards and two military intelligence soldiers -- described by then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as \"bad apples\" -- were disciplined after the scandal surfaced. Rumsfeld later said the day the scandal broke was the worst in his tenure as defense secretary. \"Clearly the worst day was Abu Ghraib, and seeing what went on there and feeling so deeply sorry that that happened,\" Rumsfeld said shortly before leaving office at the end of 2006. \"I remember being stunned by the news of the abuse.\" The United States always denied it was a matter of policy to torture detainees. But it shut down Abu Ghraib in September 2006 and turned the facility over to the Iraqis. They have revamped and reopened it. Rooms have been transformed and renovated. CNN was told, but not shown, that a few hundred prisoners are here already, in a revamped part of the facility that can hold up to 3,000 prisoners. The capacity is critical to help deal with overcrowding at Iraq's other facilities and the potential security threat. The Iraqi government is going to great lengths to try to change the image this facility has. It organized a tour for journalists, very carefully orchestrated by the Ministry of Justice. Murtada Sharif, the only Ministry of Justice official to speak to CNN on camera about the prison, admitted Abu Ghraib is synonymous in people's minds with the inhumane acts that took place there both before and after the fall of Saddam in 2003. \"We want to change its image, to make it a place of justice,\" he said. A wing that used to hold a thousand prisoners In Saddam Hussein's time now is ready for 160. Cells that used to hold between 30 and 50 people now have a capacity of eight. Prisoners and their families actually get to see each other -- the prisoners behind a cage-like structure, the families on the other side of the fence, in a courtyard with a playground for the children. Again, it is part of the whole effort to create a different atmosphere. But human rights organizations in Iraq say abuse and torture remain routine in Iraq's detention facilities. Changing Abu Ghraib's infamous reputation may take more than fresh paint and fake flowers.", "630140753cfdeb90c15875f5002e1f1050c939a2": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Vimlendu Jha is the founder and head of Swechha -- We For Change Foundation which is based in India's capital, New Delhi. \"The Dreamtime Circus is a troupe of fire dancers, jugglers, aerialists, clowns and musicians who travel the world to share the uplifting experience of the circus.\" Swechha started out as an organization to combat the pollution of the city's main waterway, the river Yamuna. Today it deals with the environmental issues that affect several aspects of Delhi. Vimlendu leads volunteers and local children to key sites around the city to tackle the ecological problems, as well as to raise awareness of the issues. Follow his efforts in his blogs and video diaries. December 4, 2007 We live in a conflict-ridden world. There is upheaval and turmoil between countries, between people, between man and nature and within one's own self. Fortunately, there are people who are striving hard to fight this feeling of gloom and despondency. Dreamtime Circus and Swechha -- We for Change Foundation have joined hands to salute this indefatigable spirit of such change makers through \"Circus for Change.\" Both organizations are comprised of people who have devoted themselves to reduce the misery of the earth and her people by way of grassroots level advocacy, raising awareness about social, cultural and political issues or by bringing smiles to the faces of many by entertaining them through their creative performances. The Dreamtime Circus is a troupe of fire dancers, jugglers, aerialists, clowns and musicians who travel the world to share the uplifting experience of the circus with the peoples of the world. During their travels, the troupe aims to support local organizations working on vital environmental, health, and humanitarian issues that impact the communities they visit. The Dreamtime Circus was founded by fire dancers and non-profit organizers Chris Dunn and Kara \"Kfire\" Voss in 2005, when they first started performing in villages throughout Indonesia. Since then, Dreamtime Circus has grown from two to 30 performers and their debut performance, \"Between Worlds,\" played to five sold out audiences in San Francisco, California, as well as a packed circus tent at the world famous \"Burning Man Festival\" in the U.S. The coming together of Dreamtime Circus and Swechha symbolizes the fusion of advocacy and creativity, and a common goal for effecting social change. One of the key objectives of Swechha's various endeavors is to help people -- primarily youth -- to rediscover their relationship with the environment and to empower them to reflect on the consumption-based lifestyle of modern times and its ill-effects. Dreamtime Circus epitomizes daring, innovation and a will to make the world a more humane place, through creative arts and in whatever little way one can. While Swechha promotes volunteerism in a big way, the performers at Dreamtime hope to further the cause of volunteerism by performing for free, wherever they travel in India and in doing so, they wish to aid local civil society groups in their work. Objectives of Circus for Change: . \u2022 To promote \"out-of-the-box\" methods for raising awareness. \u2022 To spread the message of \"One Earth, Your Earth,\" which essentially means -- political, cultural and economic boundaries notwithstanding -- this earth is undivided and there is a need for each one of us to be responsible towards it without thinking about our personal gains. \u2022 To help local NGOs in their efforts to uplift society through performances and workshops by Dreamtime Circus. It would also help the NGOs, especially the ones in rural areas, to attract media attention and get publicity for their present and future projects. \u2022 To collaborate with artists, activists and performers from different countries to promote inter-cultural learning, and to share experiences and good practices. From October 2007 through March 2008, Dreamtime Circus will tour India and perform for free in cities, villages, schools, and refugee communities throughout the country. Wherever a circus need be, a circus shall be. Performances will include an array of circus arts, music and storytelling, and will communicate positive messages of hope, dreams and respect for the Earth and all humanity. In addition to performing, the Dreamtime troupe can hold workshops to teach a variety of basic circus arts to kids of all ages. These performances and workshops will provide a unique and creative venue for partnering organizations to raise awareness about their issues. There's nothing like a circus to attract a captive audience. \"Circus for Change\" has already been staged at several places in Himachal Pradesh and Delhi. It will travel to Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh in the next five months.

The biological mother, who was not involved in the alleged trade, is to be interviewed by authorities Friday. Investigators seek further details about a case that they say unfolded this way: . Paul and Brandy Romero advertised that they were selling their pet cockatoo for $1,500. A woman named Donna Greenwell responded and said she wanted to buy the bird. Greenwell then told the Romeros that she was taking care of three children whose biological parents were going through a separation. Greenwell proposed selling two of the couple's children to the Romeros for $2,000, saying that her job as a truck driver made it hard to take care of the children, said Capt. Keith Dupre of the Evangeline Parrish Sheriff's Office in Louisiana. The parties allegedly negotiated a trade involving the two kids, the bird and $175. An anonymous tipster contacted authorities after the children began living with the Romeros. As a result, Greenwell and the Romeros were arrested February 21 and charged with aggravated kidnapping, Dupre said. The children were well taken care of when they were with the Romeros, who badly wanted children, according to Dupre. Greenwell said she needed the cash for a lawyer to handle adoption paperwork, authorities said. She had placed the third child with another Louisiana couple, Dupre said, but he didn't know whether bartering was involved. The two children were ages 4 and 5, according to CNN affiliate WGNO.

Bangladeshi firefighters continued to uncover bodies Friday of Bangladesh Rifles officers from a mass grave. By late Saturday night, 72 bodies had been found floating in a river or in three mass graves inside the compound of the Rifles, or BDR, in the capital city, Dhaka, the Home Ministry said. Fifty of the dead were confirmed to be army officers, shot or stabbed to death. Another six were Rifles troops, or jawans. The rest of the bodies were too damaged for immediate identification, the ministry said. But four days since the rebellion, grieving family members keeping vigil outside the headquarters were losing hope of seeing their loved ones alive again. Some men quietly recited verses from the Quran, Islam's holy book, or counted prayer beads. Several women howled in despair and collapsed hopelessly on the pavement. Sympathy for the mutineers has dried up, a Bangladeshi journalist said. \"The first day of the incident, Bangladeshis were for the BDR. They thought they had legitimate concerns of army officer corruption and denial of basic necessities to them,\" said Ashraf Kaiser, host of the television show, \"Road to Democracy.\" \"But from the second day, when we started getting news of missing officers and seeing pictures of one body after another being pulled out, the perception changed,\" he said. One can see the shift in the media coverage of the mutiny, he said. \"What was being called Pilkhana revolt or rebellion\" -- named after the area of the city where the BDR compounds are located -- \"is now being dubbed the Pilkhana massacre.\" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina initially earned high marks for persuading the jawans to surrender in exchange for amnesty. But now she finds herself in a delicate balancing act: trying to appease an army that demands the killers, who stubbed out the lives of so many of its officers, be punished. She met for hours Sunday with the army's top officials, and made several concessions. A committee the Home Ministry set up to investigate the mutiny will be shuffled to include more members from the army's ranks. She has also backtracked from her promise of amnesty. Killers will face trial, she said, and ordered jawans to return to their posts or report to police stations by the end of the day Sunday. Hundreds of jawans lined up at a field outside the Pilkhana headquarters, insisting to reporters they fled the compound during the rebellion. They kissed their loved ones as they waited, assuring wives and fathers they were innocent but asking for their prayers. The fear of a military take-over is a pervasive one in Bangladesh. The country has experienced a series of coup since its independence in 1971, including one that killed Hasina's father -- the country's independence leader. The current government itself came to power in December, after two years of an army-backed rule. \"Hasina has her responsibility to keep peace and tranquility and so she did what she did,\" said Aneeqa Khan, a student who lives not far from the BDR headquarters. \"And you can't fault the army from reacting. They lost so many people.\" The military did its part to allay fears of retaliation. \"I believe if exemplary punishment is meted out to the people involved directly or indirectly in the mutiny, it will help pacify the anger among our officers and soldiers,\" Brig. Gen. Mahmud Hossain told reporters. The standoff started Wednesday when BDR troops rebelled against their commanders. The BDR is a paramilitary force distinct from the army, but its commanders are career army officers. The Rifles is responsible primarily for guarding the country's borders. The force, more than 65,000-strong, also takes part in operations such as monitoring polls. The troops staged their rebellion on the second day of BDR Week, when officers and troops from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations. Discontent had been bubbling for years in the ranks of the BDR, who complained their army superiors dismissed their appeals for more pay, subsidized food and their requests to participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations -- which pay far more than what they make at home. Bangladesh and its South Asian neighbors are the largest troop contributors to U.N. peacekeeping operations. During the stand-off, dozens of officers were killed. Some bodies were dumped in mass graves. Others were tossed in sewers that emptied into the Buriganga River, where they floated for miles before being retrieved.", "ce0ca2423f44c63f7f90c5cdc2d12cd60c2b544a": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Even though she was born without arms, Jessica Cox never says \"can't.\" Jessica Cox, 25, uses her life story to inspire young people to face challenges head-on.

CNN's Nicole Lapin spoke to Cox about her determination to overcome obstacles. The following is an edited transcript of the interview: . Nicole Lapin: [Your dad] said to us he never shed a tear for you. Jessica Cox: He never saw me as a victim. I never had that as an excuse, that I was a victim of my condition. This is just who I am and I'm not a victim of anything. Lapin: We have a question from our Web site that said, \"What motivated you to become a pilot, Jessica?\" Cox: Actually, flying was my greatest fear. Eleanor Roosevelt once said, \"Identify your greatest fear and walk directly at it.\" And that's how it has been for me as a student pilot and learning how to fly an airplane. The first time, a fighter pilot, he came up and asked me if I would like to fly, and I didn't answer right away because it was my fear. But, when [someone] offered to take me up in a Cessna for the first time, I thought about it for a while and said what great opportunity, to attempt to fly an airplane. Lapin: You use your right foot on the throttle, left foot on the yoke and up you go. Cox: Yes. Lapin: We have another question in from [a viewer] who wants to know, \"What do you think could be different if you had both arms?\" You wouldn't want anything different? Cox: I mean, I would have a whole different life. So there is really no way to know where to start on that, because this is my life and I wouldn't trade it for the world, to be honest with you. And so, to think about that, I don't even know if I'd want to waste the time to even think about how my life would be different, because I enjoy it as it is now. Lapin: What kind of advice would you give young people today? Cox: Well, I think that it's important to not allow our fears to stand in the way of our opportunities. And for me, I had this great fear of flying. And I knew I couldn't pass up the opportunity. Three and a half years later, after confronting my fear and saying I'm going to do it anyway, I'm now certified. [However] just because you confront your fear doesn't necessarily mean that you can overcome it, because I still have a little bit of fear, and fear is a good thing. Lapin: We all do. Cox: Yes. So, I think that it is important not to allow our fear to stand in the way of any opportunity and stand in the way of achieving whatever we set out to accomplish.", "7131adb6b95357a143b10c426857c25926c282ab": "CLEARWATER, Florida (CNN)  -- Two NFL players are among four boaters missing since Saturday night off Florida's Gulf Coast, officials told CNN. Corey Smith, left, and Marquis Cooper are missing after a boating trip off the Florida coast, officials said. Oakland Raiders linebacker Marquis Cooper and NFL free agent Corey Smith, who played for the Detroit Lions for the past three seasons, have not returned from a Saturday fishing trip in water off Clearwater, Florida, family members and colleagues said Sunday. \"It feels like my greatest fear coming true -- it doesn't feel real,\" Cooper's wife, Rebekah, told CNN affiliate WTSP in Tampa on Sunday afternoon. \"I'm just waiting for a phone call.\" The Coast Guard began searching around 2 a.m. Sunday after it learned that four men -- Cooper, Smith, and former University of South Florida football players William Bleakley and Nick Schuyler -- had not returned from their fishing trip Saturday evening as expected. Rough weather has hampered the effort, but \"it's still a very active search,\" Coast Guard Capt. Tim Close told reporters Sunday afternoon. Poor visibility from heavy waves forced the search-and-rescue effort to be conducted primarily by air, though authorities deployed patrol boats as well, Close said.  Watch relatives, friends express concern for missing boaters \u00bb . Searchers have focused on 750 square miles of open water in the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles west of Clearwater Pass. From there, the men had left the Seminole Boat Ramp in a 21-foot single-engine boat about 6:30 a.m. Saturday, the Coast Guard said. Rebekah Cooper said she became worried Saturday night when she didn't hear from her husband. She called her one of her husband's fishing buddies, Brian Miller, who contacted the Coast Guard with the coordinates of where the men planned to fish. \"Usually I'm on the boat. It's a little difficult wondering if something would have been different if I had been there,\" Miller said. \"Or who knows? They may be just sitting out there with a broken motor -- and that's what we're hoping for.\"He said it was clear something was wrong when Cooper didn't call Saturday night. \"He should've been within range to use his cell phone, and he knows enough to shut it off when he goes out so the batteries are still there,\" he said. Close said weather conditions were relatively good Saturday, \"but the weather picked up overnight.\" \"It's a small vessel for the conditions that are out there right now,\" Close said Sunday afternoon. Rebekah Cooper said her husband was aware of Sunday's weather forecast and for that reason picked Saturday for the trip. \"Fishing is his first love, it always has been,\" she said, adding, \"I have a lot of faith in him out there.\" Cooper's father said he learned of the situation Sunday morning from his daughter-in-law. His son \"routinely stays out on the water 12-14 hours,\" Bruce Cooper, a sports anchor for CNN affiliate KPNX in Phoenix, Arizona, said in a statement. Close said authorities had not received a distress signal from the boaters. Close said Cooper owns the boat. Bruce Cooper called his son an \"avid fisherman.\" \"He goes deep sea fishing any opportunity he gets,\" Cooper said in the statement. \"Two years ago I went deep sea fishing with him. I swore I would never do so again; I didn't like the fact that I couldn't see land. Needless to say I am very concerned. I am praying and hoping for the best.\" The boat, a center-console vessel manufactured by Everglades Boats, is billed as \"unsinkable,\" Close said. The Detroit Lions released a statement acknowledging that Smith was among the missing men, adding, \"Our thoughts and prayers are with all the passengers, their families and all those involved in the search efforts.\" Smith and Cooper were teammates with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for part of the 2004 season, when Cooper was a rookie, according to the NFL's Web site. Smith, who entered the league with Tampa Bay in 2002, went on to play for the Washington Redskins before moving to the Lions for the 2006 season. Cooper has played for six teams in his five-season career. Cooper played college football at the University of Washington. Smith played at North Carolina State. Schuyler's father, Stu, told reporters that the four men knew each other from working out at a gym, and that his son had accompanied Cooper and Smith on a fishing trip last week that lasted 15 hours. Bleakley lettered from 2004 to 2006 as a tight end for USF, according to a spokesman for the university's athletics department.

Whatever you do, don't drink too much before your flight. Ryanair's investigating onboard fees for flushing. Michael O'Leary said the airline had revived inquiries into whether the airline could install coin-operated toilets on its fleet. \"People might actually have to spend a pound to spend a penny in future,\" he said in a BBC interview, adding \"We're always in Ryanair looking at the ways of constantly lowering the costs of air travel and making it more affordable and easier for passengers to fly with us.\" Asked by the incredulous presenter what passengers would do if they found themselves without money mid-flight, O'Leary replied: \"I don't think there is anybody in history that has got on board a Ryanair aircraft with less than a pound.\" Sound Off: Is it fair to charge a fee for a flush? The Irish airline is renowned for its cheap flights and regularly advertises competition-crushing deals to boost capacity on its short-haul routes. The company has made no secret of its quest to boost revenue by any means possible. It already charges for food and each bag checked into the hold is subject to a fee. Last week Ryanair announced plans to remove all its check-in counters in an effort to encourage travelers to take just one piece of hand-luggage. Ryanair's latest revenue-raising proposal has surprised few in the industry who are accustomed to its method of business. \"It seems Ryanair is prepared to plumb any depth to make a fast buck and, once again, is putting profit before the comfort of its customer,\" said Rochelle Turner, Head of Research at Which?

Thursday night, the two children were sleeping at home in Mumbai, India. Azharuddin sleeps under a plastic sheet in a shantytown beside a railway track, where the smell of urine and cow dung lingers in the air. Rubina sleeps with her parents and siblings in a tiny shack beside an open drain. The slum they live in put on a Bollywood-style welcome for the two young stars. There were music, dancing, sweets, garlands, security -- tears and tantrums -- and paparazzi. Mumbai's Garib Nagar area, which translates literally into \"poor district,\" put on a robust show for two of its own.  Watch the children get happy, chaotic reception \u00bb . Rubina and Azharuddin have lived in a Mumbai slum all their lives. They were handpicked by the producers of \"Slumdog Millionaire\" for parts in the movie, which tells the rags-to-riches tale of a young boy who grew up in a Mumbai slum. Following the film's spectacular success around the world, the producers decided to include the two young actors in the movie's Oscar experience. The children made their first journey on a plane when they were flown to Los Angeles, California, to attend the awards ceremony. \"The plane was so big,\" said Rubina. \"I'd only seen [planes] in the sky earlier and it used to look so small.\" \"America was just fantastic,\" Rubina gushed, visibly excited after she made a dramatic entry into the slum on her father's shoulders on Thursday afternoon. \"I was so excited to be on stage at the Oscars. Everyone was crying.\" Red-carpet formalities done, the children were given a whirlwind tour of Los Angeles. The highlight -- a trip to Disneyland. \"I loved all the rides, especially the fast ones,\" said Rubina. The trip to the United States did have some drawbacks though. \"The food is different over there,\" said Rubina. \" I didn't like it. I missed Indian food.\" They'll have plenty of that now that they're back home. The first thing Azharuddin did when he returned to Garib Nagar was to dig into a plate of biryani, a traditional Indian meal of meat and rice, at a restaurant. His mother, who accompanied him to Los Angeles, spoke to reporters at home -- a makeshift shelter under a tree, with a torn plastic sheet for a roof.  See where the children live \u00bb . She said she hoped the \"Slumdog Millionaire\" experience would change things. \"It would be nice to get a proper home.\" She says she has heard rumors the government may provide her family with one, but no one has confirmed any plans for a new home. \"I've been praying for a new home for so long. It's all up to Allah now.\" Returning to their slum, Azharuddin and Rubina were excited -- and exhausted -- by media attention that was sometimes a little overwhelming. Azharuddin burst into tears while eating lunch, leaving his biryani unfinished, his every move caught on camera. Hoping to secure a future for Azharuddin and Rubina, the film's producers have enrolled them in a school and set up a trust fund to ensure their welfare. \"We thought long and hard about how best can we benefit them and we decided to put in place an education plan for them,\" said Danny Boyle, the movie's director. iReport.com: One iReporter's personal 'slumdog' experience . \"We put them in school, a very good school, which they're paid for to stay in until they're 18.

The Telegraph newspaper of London, England, quoted their parents saying Azharuddin was paid less than $2,500, and that Rubina got about $700. \"The children were paid well,\" Boyle said. \"The families were paid well for their work, over and above what you could pay, way over and above what you could pay.\" \"I hope the children get a better life after this,\" said a neighbor who waited outside her home all day to welcome the children home. \"They've achieved so much at a young age.

Her knees, hips and ankles hurt from arthritis. Anne Stephens, 61, was in her late 30s when she was diagnosed with osteoarthritis. \"I can't sit too long. I can't stand too long, and I can't walk too long,\" said Stephens, 61, from Conyers, Georgia. Stephens is among the 27 million Americans who suffer from the most common form of arthritis called osteoarthritis. \"I think people tend to think of this as more of a nuisance,\" said Dr. John Klippel, president and CEO of the Arthritis Foundation. \"They think of it as only aches and pains and not the serious problem that it actually is -- the leading cause of disability in this country.\" Klippel said part of the misconception has to do with all the myths surrounding the disease. Common myth 1: Arthritis is a disease of the elderly . While older people do develop arthritis, children and teenagers can get certain forms of the condition, Klippel said. The Arthritis Foundation reports two-thirds of people with doctor-diagnosed arthritis are under age 65.  Watch more on arthritis fact and fiction \u00bb . Stephens was in her late 30s when she developed osteoarthritis after injuring her knees running and playing volleyball. She felt a sharp pain and recalled, \"It was downhill after that.\" Researchers don't know the exact cause of arthritis, but they do know what puts people at risk. Klippel said that while the disease is associated with aging, other risk factors include heredity, joint injury, obesity and lack of fitness. Common myth 2: Cracking your knuckles causes arthritis . Despite what your grandmother told you, experts say cracking your knuckles is not a risk factor for arthritis. \"It's annoying -- it's certainly not good for the joints, but on the other hand, it doesn't cause arthritis,\" Klippel said. Common myth 3: Predicting the weather . \"Boy, there's a good myth,\" Klippel said with a chuckle. \"I can't tell you how many patients I would take care of who would say they were better than the weatherman at predicting changes in humidity.\" He said researchers have studied the claims, but concluded there is no scientific evidence to suggest arthritis flare-ups occur during bad weather. Klippel also doesn't buy the argument that arthritis patients are better off if they live in a warmer climate. \"If you live in a warmer climate, you're simply more active for more months of the year and that's probably why people feel better,\" Klippel said. \"It probably has very little to do with the weather itself.\" Common myth 4: Exercise aggravates arthritis . Staying active actually is one of the most important ways to prevent and ease the pain of arthritis, Klippel said. It also helps with weight control. \"For people with arthritis, it hurts to exercise,\" he said. \"But over time, the post-exercise pain actually diminishes if you push through it.\" He recommended choosing joint-friendly exercises such as walking, biking or swimming. In addition to putting ice on an aching joint, Klippel suggested taking nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory medication before or after exercising to help relieve the pain. \"People need to stay active and move their joints to keep the muscles strong and to keep the joints flexible,\" Klippel said. Common myth 5: Nothing helps . Klippel worries about arthritis patients who don't seek medical help because they don't think anything can be done about the pain. He said a proper diagnosis can lead to a host of possible treatments, including the latest prescription medicines for pain and rehabilitating aching joints through physical therapy. Klippel urges people not to wait until the pain is unbearable before seeing a doctor. \"If aches and pains persist for more than four weeks, that's a time to pay attention,\" he said. Anne Stephens followed that advice and she said it has made all the difference. She manages the inflammation and pain by taking prescription medication (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug). She also exercises at least three days a week; the workouts help her strengthen her muscles. And she sees her doctor several times a year. \"I've learned to adapt,\" she said. \"I know what's going to hurt me and what doesn't.\"", "016163428c6e9f0eef6a08d243e6f0b286f8796e": "(CNN) -- Two hijackers who took over a plane flying from Sudan's Darfur region on Tuesday and diverted it to Libya surrendered to authorities Wednesday, Libyan state media said. The hijacked plane took off from near the Darfur refugee camp of Kalma, which was attacked earlier in the week. The official news agency JANA said the two hijackers surrendered to Libyan authorities in the eastern town of Kufra, where the plane landed, and they were being detained in a hall in the airport there. Their identities were not released. Earlier, the hijackers had released all 87 passengers aboard the plane, but had held on to six crew members while they negotiated with Libyan officials through the pilot about passage to France, JANA said. Libyan officials tried to persuade the hostage-takers to surrender as the hijackers demanded fuel to fly the plane to Paris, France. No details were provided as to how the two surrendered. All of the remaining hostages were freed, and JANA said 20 Sudanese officials were en route to the airport. Libya will send a plane to return the passengers and crew to Khartoum, Sudan, the plane's original destination, JANA said. The Sun Air Boeing 737 airliner was about 10 minutes into a flight from Niyala, Sudan, to Khartoum on Tuesday when the pilot called the control tower and told officials the plane had been hijacked and was heading to Kufra, Sun Air airlines official Murtada Hassan Jumaa told the Al-Arabiya news channel. The hijackers at first wanted to land the plane in Egypt, but the Egyptian government refused them permission, John Ukec, Sudan's ambassador to the United States, said Tuesday. Khaled Deeb, an Al-Jazeera reporter in Tripoli, Libya, said Libyan authorities allowed the plane to land only because the hijackers said they were low on fuel -- \"for humanitarian reasons and nothing else.\" \"The fact that the plane was kidnapped from Darfur indicates that one of the militant groups may have prepared for this operation, and the fact that they want to go to France adds more to that theory,\" Deeb said Tuesday. \"The hijackers don't have any clear demands except for fuel and then heading to France.\" -- CNN's Mustafa Al-Arab contributed to this report .", "88ace3ae9e91238f38211b0a9f02c4001f1ba0af": "MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- President Bush surveyed this week's bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and pledged the government would \"eliminate roadblocks\" and \"cut through paperwork\" to get it rebuilt. \"I bring prayers from the American people to those who have suffered loss of life as a result of the collapse of the 35W bridge in the Twin Cities.

On Friday, the chief federal investigator said the south end of the bridge \"behaved differently\" from the rest of the structure during its catastrophic collapse. National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Mark Rosenker said, based on a video of the collapse and where the bridge debris lies, the southern end shifted 50 feet to the east. \"And when we compare that to what we've seen in the rest of the bridge, the rest of the bridge appears to have collapsed in place,\" Rosenker told reporters. Rosenker cautioned that investigators' interest in the southern end does not mean they have found the cause of the bridge collapse. \"What we have is a step forward,\" he said. \"We believe that as the bridge began to fall, as it began to collapse, it shifted,\" Rosenker said. \"I am not saying that the 50-foot shift created the fall. That is not what we believe. What we believe is whatever created the failure, we also saw a 50-foot shift in the southern end of the structure.\" Rosenker would not offer any theories on what caused the collapse, saying that would come after the 19 investigators have completed their analysis.

Pakistani soldiers on patrol in the Swat Valley, which is home to the country's only ski resort. Militants forced their way into the state-run hotel in the northwestern tourist valley early Thursday morning, ransacked it and set it on fire, said Sardar Rehim Shahzad, district coordinator for Swat police. The hotel, the only one at the Malam Jabba ski resort, sustained significant damage, he told CNN. The resort is located near the Afghanistan border and about 300km (186 miles) from the capital city of Islamabad. It was shut down last summer after militants overran the area, keeping tourists away, Shahzad said. Swat Valley, located in North West Frontier Province (NWFP), was once Pakistan's biggest tourist destination. Aside from the ski resort, it was a draw for trout-fishing enthusiasts and visitors to the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area. In recent months, however, militants bent on imposing fundamentalist Islamic law, or Sharia, have unleashed a wave of violence across the NWFP which has claimed hundreds of lives, many of them security personnel. The militants want women to wear veils, beards for men and to ban music and television. After months of bloody battles, the government in May reached a peace deal with fighters loyal to the banned hardline Islamic group, Tehreek Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi (TNSM). It is the latest attempt by Pakistan's new government -- headed by the party of the assassinated prime minister Benazir Bhutto -- to achieve peace through negotiations in the lawless tribal areas where Taliban and al Qaeda leaders are believed to have free rein. Ahead of the peace pact, Pakistan's government released TNSM's former leader Sufi Mohammed, who had been jailed in 2002 after recruiting thousands of fighters to battle U.S. forces in Afghanistan. He was freed after agreeing to cooperate with the government. Under the terms of his release, TNSM was also expected to lay down its arms and forgo violence. But his son-in-law Fazlullah, who took over TNSM during his jail stint, vowed to continue his fight to impose fundamentalist Islamic law in the region.", "32c0cc080bb3a1877e79bacf87332c596f1d45b0": "(CNN) -- Local security forces and coalition soldiers in western Afghanistan killed several insurgents Thursday in what the NATO command called a \"successful operation against high-priority Taliban targets.\" British troops detain suspected Taliban Militants during a recent operation in Afghanistan. The operation took place in the Shindand district of Herat province. Two Taliban leaders, Haji Dawlat Khan and Haji Nasrullah Khan, and \"significant number of other insurgents\" were killed, according to a statement from NATO's International Security Assistance Force. It added there was no evidence of civilian casualties or accidental damage in the operation, in which a \"number of men were discovered handcuffed and imprisoned in appalling conditions in one of the insurgent compounds.\" The incident reflects the increasing violence between troops and Taliban militants across Afghanistan and the growing concern in the United States that the war there should be more of a priority than it has been. Since May, the deaths of U.S. and allied troops have far outpaced the toll in Iraq. On Thursday, the toll in Afghanistan was 21 compared to six in Iraq. The International Security Assistance Force did not provide the nationality of the soldier who died in Afghanistan Thursday. Two top Pentagon officials said Wednesday they expect to be able to recommend more troop reductions in Iraq this fall and will try to find ways to increase troops in Afghanistan.

The British Defense Ministry said its troops in southern Afghanistan killed a senior Taliban leader, two weeks after another leading militant died in a British missile attack. Mullah Bismullah Akhund was killed Saturday in the Now Zad district of Helmand, long a Taliban bastion. The Defense Ministry, in a statement on Wednesday, called Bismullah \"a senior key facilitator and logistician responsible for the northern Helmand region.\" The ministry says his death will disrupt the Taliban's leadership structure and hamper the group's ability to conduct attacks. \"He is believed to have commanded numerous fighters and was identified by Task Force Helmand as a key player in the insurgency, and criminality, before the strike,\" according to ISAF. British troops, which are part of the assistance force, announced the killing on Thursday. Saturday's operation occurred 15 days after British troops killed another senior Taliban militant, Sadiqullah, in an Apache missile strike. \"Bismullah was closely associated with local Taliban leader Mullah Rahim, whose brother was also killed during this operation,\" ISAF said.

Nine members of Plane Stupid, which campaigns against airport expansion and aviation-related climate change, entered the airport grounds at about 2:15 a.m. Tuesday (9:15 p.m. Monday ET), the group said. A spokesman for the airport called the protest \"dangerous and highly irresponsible.\" By mid-morning, the seven members on the ground had been arrested, but the two protesters remained on the roof, group spokesman Leo Mullay told CNN.

Bobby Jindal in a prime-time exclusive interview Monday night. Lousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Barack Obama: \"I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is.\" Jindal gave the Republican response after President Obama's address to Congress last week. Jindal received negative reviews after the speech, and Larry asked him how he felt about that. They also talked about the war of words in the Republican Party centered around Rush Limbaugh. The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: Governor, you took a lot of flak for that speech. Were you surprised that you did? Gov. Bobby Jindal: Let's be clear, the president is a great speaker -- probably the greatest we've seen in a generation. I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is. And I'm not the only one that's got that opinion. I hope people look at the content of the speech, not just the delivery. You know, for years, I've been told I speak too quickly. Now I'm told I speak too slowly. What's more important is I was outlining a philosophical difference with the stimulus package, with the leadership in Congress, with the administration. I was outlining a philosophical disagreement that says we need to get businesses hiring again. We need to put more money in the private sector.  Watch Larry King's interview with Gov. Bobby Jindal \u00bb . Let's cut taxes. Let's get rid of the wasteful spending. That's the debate. That's the discussion we need to be having. King: But governor, to say that the federal government apparently has no voice in this crisis, when in some cases, they are the only answer, that pointed to a lot of the criticism, didn't it? Jindal: If the president had actually delivered the targeted temporary stimulus package that he described, I think you'd see a lot more conservative and Republican support. We absolutely agree with the kind of infrastructure spending he describes -- speeding up federal spending that would have happened anyway. Less than 5 percent of this bill was actually [for] the shovel-ready infrastructure spending that he described.  ... Fundamentally, I don't think $30 million for the federal government to buy new cars, $1 billion for the Census, $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs. King: There was no criticism of the Bush bailout of the automobile industry. No criticism of the last eight years of the Republican leadership with a tremendous deficit. Jindal: Well, Larry, I think that you're absolutely right. One of the reasons the Republicans lost the elections in 2006 and 2008 is the Republican Party didn't match its actions with its rhetoric. ... I think one of the reasons we lost elections was that the Republicans came to Washington to change the culture and instead became captive of that culture. The Republican Party defended spending and corruption we never would have accepted from the other side. King: Governor, if perception is reality, do you think your speech hurt the party? Jindal: I think that people are going to look at the content. I think people are going to be focused now that we've [got] alternative views on how to move our country forward. Let me begin the first to say we want to work with the president every chance we can get. Whenever we can find areas of agreement, we need to work across the aisle and put America first. But when we disagree, we need to offer principled alternative solutions. So for example, in health care, I agree with the president that health care should be affordable for every American. I just don't think it should be a government-run program. King: All right, governor, here was Rush Limbaugh at this weekend's CPAC Conference. Watch. Rush Limbaugh: What is so strange about being honest and saying I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and reform this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation? Why would I want that to succeed? King: Governor, do you think people are thinking about capitalism now or are they thinking about problems? Jindal: Look, clearly, the American people are worried about paying their mortgages, keeping their jobs and paying their health care bills. I think Rush is a great leader for conservatives. I think he articulates what a lot of people are concerned about. King: Do you want him [Obama] to fail? Jindal: I don't want those policies to be adopted. I want my country to succeed, but I don't want policies to be adopted. King: What if the policies work? Jindal: Well, again... King: What if they work? Jindal: This is where we have a fundamental disagreement. I don't think it's going work ... to spend in excess of our revenues. I want my country to succeed. But what I worry about is that simply spending money on new programs. Look at every new bailout. You talked about the auto bailouts. Then you had the fourth, I think it's the fourth -- it's hard to keep track -- AIG bailout today. It seems like every time you turn around, there's another trillion dollar plan. King: One more thing. It may be moot now, but RNC Chairman Michael Steele took some shots at Limbaugh and then apologized. What do you make of all of that? Jindal: Well, I didn't follow the day's events. I'm glad he apologized. I think the chairman is a breath of fresh air for the party. As I said before, I think Rush is a leader for many conservatives and says things that people are concerned about. [He] articulates very well the concern people have about growing government spending without an end in sight. King: Thanks, governor. We'll call on you again. Always good seeing you.

It's also home to more than 600 species of bacteria, which are harmlessly enjoying the moisture of your mouth. There's a slew of bacteria floating around in your mouth, but it's generally harmless. Since people have different eating habits in different places, you might think an American's saliva might look a lot different from, say, a South African's. But a new study published in the journal Genome Research finds that bacteria in saliva may not be as related to environment and diet as you might think. In fact, researchers found that the human salivary microbiome -- that is, the community of bacteria in saliva -- does not vary greatly between different geographic locations. That means your saliva is just as different from your neighbor's as someone's on the other side of the planet. \"It was somewhat surprising to us, because in our sampling we didn't control for diet, or environment, or anything like that,\" said Mark Stoneking of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and co-author of the study. Now, Stoneking and colleagues are trying to figure out why. One theory is that since the researchers looked only at the genus of the bacteria in question, they might find more differences at the level of individual species. They are investigating this in a follow-up study. Stoneking became interested in surveying the bacteria of saliva when he learned that saliva contains more DNA than blood, if you include DNA of bacteria and other organisms.  Human blood, as you might guess, still contains more human DNA than saliva. Researchers took saliva samples from a total of 120 healthy subjects. The countries represented in this sample were Germany, Poland, Turkey, Georgia, China, Philippines, South Africa, Republic of the Congo, Argentina, Bolivia and the United States. This was the first global survey of bacteria diversity in human saliva. The most common type of bacteria found in the survey of saliva was Streptococcus, Stoneking said. People typically have Streptococcus in their mouths living benignly, although certain species are responsible for diseases such as strep throat, meningitis and bacterial pneumonia. Why do you need hundreds of bacteria species in your mouth? It turns out they're mostly not helping you at all -- you're just giving them a warm, moist home. \"Having those bacteria -- that's the price we have to pay for having a lot of saliva in the mouth to begin with,\" said Nate Dominy, anthropologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Dominy, who has studied enzymes in saliva, found the results surprising, and said no one had previously surveyed the variety of bacteria in saliva. What else is inside saliva? One component of saliva that has been shown to vary according to diet is amylase, the only digestive enzyme that converts starch into sugar, Dominy said. Amylase is also found in the pancreas and the small intestine. The human body evolved to start the digestive process early, in the mouth, so we can maximize the amount of sugar that we take in, Dominy said. \"Given that we have such large brains, and our brains are metabolically very demanding tissues, they're extremely costly and expensive to maintain, so we need a lot of sugar,\"  he said. Americans in particular have a lot of amylase in their saliva because their diets are full of starch: chips, rice and baked potatoes. But the Pygmies of central Africa, for example, eat mostly game animals, honey and fruit. They have relatively little amylase in their saliva. Dominy and colleagues found these differences at the genetic level, meaning natural selection has favored large quantities of amylase in populations with starchy diets. But there is also evidence that amylase levels can rise and fall within an individual's lifetime. A study on college students in Ghana, who typically eat a lot of meat at the university, found that students who had grown up eating traditional starchy Ghanaian home-cooked meals had lower levels of amylase after attending the school. Humans have had starch as an important part of their diet for at least 12,000 years, since the advent of agriculture, he said. So what else is spit good for? Saliva spreads molecules to the taste receptors on the tongue so you can tell whether something is salty, sour, sweet or spicy, Dominy said. It also helps soften food and spread it to your teeth so that you don't have to chew as hard. Compared with other animals, humans are not very good at detecting toxins, he said. As a result, humans vomit much more than other species, and saliva buffers the acid that results from throwing up -- meaning you'll likely salivate immediately beforehand to limit the damage. \"A lot of the value of saliva is attributable to the fact that, in human evolution, we've had to eat marginal plant foods, things that are marginal in quality and full of toxins, and we need these particular salivary adaptations to help cope with those types of food,\" he said.", "17568db07eff3644d5b28d19429acb78a086bcb2": "JUAREZ, Mexico (CNN) -- Jose Molinar knew something wasn't right. He hadn't heard from his wife for a few hours, which was not sitting well with him. Marisella Molinar was killed while driving her boss, a target of cartels, across the border into El Paso, Texas. Marisella Molinar worked as a secretary for a top prosecutor in Juarez, Mexico, Jesus Huerta Yedra. She was employed in the office for more than 10 years and though she lived across the border in El Paso, Texas, with her husband, she drove about 20 minutes over the Juarez-El Paso border every day to the job she loved. The growing violence over rival drug cartels had concerned the couple, but Mexico was a part of their lives and they were sure the violence stayed between rival drug gangs, who were fighting over a lucrative drug route into the United States. Without fail, Marisella Molinar would call her husband every day when she arrived to work, went out for lunch and when she was leaving the office. But on December 3, 2008, by around 5:30 p.m., Jose Molinar still hadn't heard from his wife. He called the office in Mexico and was told she was giving her boss a ride over the border so he could do some Christmas shopping. Jose Molinar turned on his television, and his life changed forever. \"As soon as the image came up, I saw her truck,\" said Molinar, who was watching the news out of Juarez, \"and I knew what happened right then and there.\"  Watch Jose Molinar talk about the moment he knew his wife was killed \u00bb . Marisella Molinar was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Her passenger, Jesus Huerta Yedra, was a target of the cartels that day. As Molinar's car was about a mile away from the border crossing back to the United States, gunmen walked up to her car and fired 85 rounds from an AK-47 into their intended target. One shot hit Marisella Molinar, a mother of two and proud grandmother, in the chest, killing her instantly. \"She wasn't involved, she didn't have anything to do with this!\" said Jose Molinar in a recent interview with CNN. \"She was the guy's secretary and she was giving him a ride to meet his wife here in El Paso who was Christmas shopping.\" But instead of making it home to help her husband hang Christmas lights, Marisella Molinar became yet another victim in the drug war taking place just steps from the U.S. border. The violence generated by the war of the drug cartels for control of drug routes translated last year into some 6,000 killings. More than 1,600 of them occurred in Juarez, three times more than the most murderous city in the United States. This year, in two months, the body count in Juarez is 400. Mexican military and police in riot gear now patrol the once popular streets of Juarez. Gone are the Americans shopping, dining and partying. The bars and restaurants are shuttered -- many closed for good. Americans don't come here anymore. In March 2008, the Mexican military joined with Mexican states and local law enforcement in the fight against drug cartels in border cities. Mexican President Felipe Calderon has waged a war against business as usual with the cartels who controlled drug routes through Mexico and into the United States. The fallout has led rival drug gangs to launch all-out war not only with the military, but also with each other, because the once-established drug routes are now up for grabs. The violence has been the worst in Juarez, where cartels have killed police officers, forced the chief of police to resign and threatened public officials. \"They started killing police officers, and not when they were doing police work, but when they were coming out of their homes and getting into their cars to go to the police station,\" said Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz, whose own family has recently received death threats. At the city's only morgue, bodies are piling up. The mayor said there are far too many dead for the small facility to handle. The majority of the dead are unidentified members of the cartels. Just last week, the mayor said, 50 corpses were buried in mass graves because no one claimed the bodies. Officials from both sides of the border said the drug war may go on for years. Beheadings, bodies riddled with gunfire and blood-stained streets will continue daily, they said. They added that the appetite for illegal drugs is too great in the United States, and the drug routes are too lucrative for the battles to end. \"It's not going to be won quickly,\" said Enrique Torres, a spokesman for the Mexican government, adding that the Mexican president is committed to fighting the cartels. \"He can't talk about a time frame in this type of situation. We know the monster is big, but we don't have an idea of how big it is.\"", "e3e2d2011d64e8d1bc6be36776abb2c9fb85a577": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- A New York Post cartoon Wednesday drew fire from civil rights activist Al Sharpton and others who say the drawing invokes historically racist images in suggesting an ape wrote President Barack Obama's economic stimulus package. Al Sharpton says he wonders whether the cartoon \"is making a less-than-casual inference\" to a form of racism. The artist, Sean Delonas, called Sharpton's reaction \"ridiculous,\" and the newspaper defended its decision to run his cartoon. But other African-American leaders joined Sharpton, who has been the butt of previous Delonas panels, in attacking what they called the cartoon's racial overtones. \"Sean Delonas' cartoon in today's New York Post is insensitive and offensive,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon. \"Comparing President Obama and his effort to revive the economy in a manner that depicts violence and racist inferences is unacceptable.\" The cartoon showed two police officers standing over the body of a chimpanzee they just shot, a reference to this week's mauling of a Connecticut woman by a pet chimp, which police killed after the attack. In the cartoon, one of the officers tells the other, \"They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.\" New York Post: See cartoon . The nearly $800 billion stimulus package was the priority for Obama, the first African-American U.S. president, who signed it Tuesday.   Watch Sharpton raise racism concerns, and see the cartoon \u00bb . \"The cartoon in today's New York Post is troubling at best, given the racist attacks throughout history that have made African-Americans synonymous with monkeys,\" Sharpton said. Sharpton questioned whether Delonas \"is making a less-than-casual inference to this form of racism.\" \"The Post should at least clarify what point they were trying to make in this cartoon, and reprimand their cartoonist for making inferences that are offensive and divisive at a time the nation struggles to come together to stabilize the economy if, in fact, this was yet another racially charged cartoon,\" he said. In a brief phone interview with CNN, Delonas called the controversy \"absolutely friggin' ridiculous.\" \"Do you really think I'm saying Obama should be shot? I didn't see that in the cartoon,\" Delonas said. \"It's about the economic stimulus bill,\" he added. \"If you're going to make that about anybody, it would be [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi, which it's not.\" Col Allan, the Post's editor-in-chief, said the cartoon \"is a clear parody of a current news event.\"  Watch CNN panel discuss the cartoon \u00bb . \"It broadly mocks Washington's efforts to revive the economy. Again, Al Sharpton reveals himself as nothing more than a publicity opportunist,\" Allan said in a written statement.  But Sharpton and Morial were not alone in their criticism. Barbara Ciara, president of the National Association of Black Journalists, said the Post showed a \"serious lapse in judgment\" by running the cartoon. \"To think that the cartoonist and the responsible editors at the paper did not see the racist overtones of the finished product should insult their intelligence,\" Ciara said in a written statement. \"Instead, they celebrate their own lack of perspective and criticize those who call it what it is: tone deaf at best, overtly racist at worst.\" Jeff Johnson, a former activist turned Black Entertainment Television host, said provocative cartoons are good, but that \"none of this is appropriate on any level.\" \"The Post ultimately has to answer ... [for] a specific reference to the president of the United States to violence and to his connection to an animal likeness,\" Johnson said. In California, civil rights leader Earl Ofari Hutchinson called on the Post to apologize. \"In times past, that depiction of African-Americans has been vigorously condemned as racially offensive,\" Hutchinson said in a statement issued from his Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable. \"The cartoon also subtly condones violence. We call on the Post management to issue an immediate apology and a statement that racial insults will not be tolerated by Post writers and cartoonists.\"", "486f25d3d5db2468664c9801e1cbd77b41c672b4": "(CNN) -- I've never been one to attend the performances of symphony orchestras, but off and on, for more than 35 years, I gave myself the gift of something even better: . Paul Harvey received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bush in 2005. I would go and sit with Paul Harvey as he broadcast his radio show. It was music; it was thrilling. I met him in the early 1970s, when I was a young newspaper reporter in Chicago, and that's when he allowed me, for the first time, to sit silently in his studio as he did his work. Over the years, whenever I felt a need for a Paul Harvey fix, he was always welcoming, and we came to know each other well. I would sit there wordlessly and observe absolute excellence. He would invariably be wearing a smock when I arrived -- he had been working since well before the sun came up, and the smock would cover his shirt and tie. It was the kind of smock a jeweler might wear, or a watchmaker -- it was crisply pressed, the uniform of an expert craftsman. I never asked him why he wore it, but I suspect that was the reason -- pride in craftsmanship. He would be at the typewriter, honing his script. He was famed for his voice, but the writing itself was so beautiful -- his respect for words, his understanding of the potency of economy, his instinct for removing the superfluous. The world heard him speak, but the world never saw him write, and I think he honored both aspects of his skill equally. He would walk down the hallway to his studio just minutes before airtime. The studio itself -- when I first knew him it was on the west side of North Michigan Avenue, and in later years he moved it to the east side of the street -- was far from lavish. It was impossible to equate the spartan surroundings with the idea that his voice was leaving this little room and traveling around the world. Maybe that was the point: He worked for the illusion of unfussy intimacy. He would make these warm-up noises -- voice exercises, silly-sounding tweets and yodels, strange little un-Paul-Harvey-like sounds -- and he showed no self-consciousness about doing it in front of someone else, because would a National Football League linebacker be self-conscious about someone seeing him stretch before a game, would a National Basketball Association forward be worried about someone seeing him leap up and down before tipoff? This was Paul Harvey's arena, and he would get the voice ready, loosening it, easing it up to the starting line. And then the signal from the booth, and. . . \"Hello, Americans! This is Paul Harvey! Stand by. . . for news!\" And he would look down at those words that had come out of his typewriter minutes before -- some of them underlined to remind him to punch them hard -- and they became something grander than ink on paper, they became the song, the Paul Harvey symphony. He would allow me to sit right with him in the little room -- he never made me watch from behind the glass -- and there were moments, when his phrases, his word choices, were so perfect -- flawlessly written, flawlessly delivered -- that I just wanted to stand up and cheer. But of course I never did any such thing -- in Paul Harvey's studio, if you felt a tickle in your throat you would begin to panic, because you knew that if you so much as coughed it would go out over the air into cities and towns all across the continent -- so there were never any cheers. The impulse was always there, though -- when he would drop one of those famous Paul Harvey pauses into the middle of a sentence, letting it linger, proving once again the power of pure silence, the tease of anticipation, you just wanted to applaud for his mastery of his life's work. iReport.com: Share your memories of radio legend Harvey . He probably wouldn't have thought of himself this way, but he was the ultimate singer-songwriter. He wrote the lyrics. And then he went onto his stage and performed them. The cadences that came out of his fingertips at the typewriter were designed to be translated by one voice -- his voice -- and he did it every working day for more than half a century: did it so well that he became a part of the very atmosphere, an element of the American air. He had difficult years toward the end. At one point there was a problem with his vocal cords, and he had to leave his broadcast for an extended period; when he came back he told me he had felt fear and the deepest kind of despondency, because he thought he might be finished. He wasn't; he was able to work again, and then in the last 12 months he became ill, and his beloved wife, Angel, died; he turned 90 and he wasn't on the air as much. I was in St. Louis last fall to cover the vice presidential debate, and I was taking a morning walk through the suburb of Clayton. I was on Wydown Boulevard, on a sidewalk beneath some old and thick trees, and the cell phone in my pocket rang. It was Mr. Harvey. I didn't know exactly why he was calling that day, and I still am not certain, but my sense was that he just felt a need to talk. This was during the time when his radio appearances had become sporadic; I knew how lonely he was without Mrs. Harvey. The voice, of course, was much older, and not as strong, but it was his voice, arriving out of the air in yet another American town, and what I said to him then is what I will say to you now: It was wonderful to hear it again. I walked down the street, his voice in my ear.

A photograph released by the Thai navy shows a group of men captured on December 12. The agreement was reached in side talks between the Thai and Myanmese foreign ministers during the 14th ASEAN summit, a meeting of Southeast Asian nations held in Thailand over the weekend, said Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Thairit Charungwat on Monday. Thousands of Rohingya refugees -- a Muslim minority group from Myanmar -- have fled to Thailand over the years, saying they are persecuted by Myanmar's hard-line military government. In recent months, controversy has erupted as the Thai military has been accused of intercepting boatloads of Rohingya, sabotaging their vessels and abandoning them at sea. Thailand eventually acknowledged such actions, after initial denials. About 20,000 Rohingya migrants already live in Thailand, according to its foreign ministry, which says Thailand is being inundated. The refugees -- who lack documentation -- live on the fringes in Thailand and Myanmar. But in Myanmar, \"things like forced relocation, forced conscription, forced labor -- these things are exacerbated for the Rohginyas,\" said Benjamin Zawacki of Amnesty International. \"In addition to that, they suffer from what is really systemic discrimination, systemic persecution. Things, for example, like not being able to marry outside their ethnicity, very strict restrictions on movement, the inability to work for the government, to hold jobs as civil servants. They are summarily disenfranchised. They are not able to vote. They are not even held to be citizens.\" The latest group of 78 Rohingya boat people, who arrived Thailand a month ago, has been detained there. Some of the 78 have required medical treatment, after being abused by the Myanmese navy, they say. \"They will have to be sent back, according to our law,\" Thailand's Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva told CNN. \"They are entering the country illegally.\"  Watch CNN's \"The Forgotten People\" on Rohingyas' escape to Thailand \u00bb . Myanmar says it will take refugees back if they can prove that they are Bengali, a recognized ethnic group in Myanmar. Proof would include confirmation by relatives, a standard practice in a country that often lacks documentation. But the refugees have resisted being returned to Myanmar, saying they would be killed. \"At least this issue is being raised at international and regional level,\" Charungwat said. \"Myanmar has also started to establish communication and participation on this issue, and join with ASEAN, as it is a regional issue to be solved.\"", "644a3f79470d3b457efacc7d4ea33577d59e69c1": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- One of the Marines shown in a famous World War II photograph raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima was posthumously awarded a certificate of U.S. citizenship on Tuesday.

The plan is aimed at \"folks who are playing by the rules,\" Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan says. President Barack Obama announced the plan Wednesday, saying it will help up to 9 million people keep their homes in a housing market ravaged by foreclosures. But critics, including several leading Republicans and some commentators, said the $75 billion proposal will unfairly help some people at the expense of others. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs acknowledged Friday that some people who made \"bad decisions\" might end up getting help under the proposal. But Donovan, Obama's secretary of housing and urban development, told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday that \"there are no 'flippers,' investor-owners or scammers that are eligible for this program.\" \"We're going check everybody's income when they come into this program. We're going to make sure that people are paying their bills. And more than anything, we're targeting the folks who are playing by the rules,\" Donovan said. The administration's proposal would make it easier for homeowners to afford their monthly payments either by refinancing the mortgages or having their loans modified. And it would vastly broaden the scope of the government rescue by focusing on homeowners who are still current in their payments but at risk of default. Read more about the plan . South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican who also has criticized the administration's stimulus package, called the mortgage plan \"a horrible idea.\" \"About 95 percent of folks are playing by the rules and struggling, but still paying their mortgages. The idea that somebody down the street gets a different system, I think, is ultimately something that's going to undermine a whole lot of other folks with regard to paying their mortgage,\" Sanford told \"Fox News Sunday.\" In particular, he singled out a provision that would allow judges to modify or reduce the principal of loans for borrowers in bankruptcy -- an idea Sanford called \"incredibly dangerous for the precedent it sets.\" But Donovan told CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that judges already have that power for second homes or vacation homes. \"It's only for people who have one home and are living in it or are in trouble where you can't have a modification of that loan in bankruptcy,\" he said. But he said the administration would limit the plan to existing loans, not future ones, and considered it a \"last resort.\" \"There seems to be growing consensus that this is an important part of the solution,\" he said. About $50 billion of the money would come from the $700 billion financial industry bailout package, a senior administration official said Friday. Nationalized mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will contribute more than $20 billion to the loan modification program, mainly to subsidize interest rates so troubled borrowers' monthly payments can be lowered to affordable levels. But those companies are on shaky financial ground themselves and are expected to report billions in losses in the next week or two. To stabilize them, the foreclosure prevention program calls for doubling their lines of credit with the federal government to $200 billion each. Donovan said 45 percent of home sales in December were \"distressed,\" meaning either sellers were facing foreclosure or the homes were already seized by the bank, driving down home prices further in an already-battered market. \"We've got to make clear, here, that a foreclosure hurts every American,\" he told CNN. In releasing his proposal Wednesday, Obama said it would help both responsible homeowners suffering from falling home prices and borrowers either at risk of or already in default. But it does virtually nothing for the unemployed, who often don't have enough income to make any reasonable monthly payment affordable. And since it relies more heavily on lowering interest rates than on reducing principal, it does little for borrowers concerned their homes will never recoup their value.", "de8fabbf83450b302628c7666ece93c702eab008": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- It only takes one injury to end an athlete's career. Anything that impairs an athlete's performance could mean they're no longer good enough for the top flight -- that's why the best athletes need the best treatment if they're to recover from injury. Owen Hargreaves (L) in action before his career was cut short by tendonitis. Manchester United star and England international footballer Owen Hargreaves is known for his versatility and exceptional work rate, but in 2008 his season was cut short by tendonitis. Hargreaves, 27, was told he would need surgery on both knees to save his career. That's when he decided to travel to the small mountain ski village of Vail, Colorado, to meet the \"knee whisperer\" -- Dr Richard Steadman. Steadman became fascinated with the way the knee functions and how it can be injured during his university days playing American football. Now known as \"Doctor Steady,\" Steadman is knee specialist to the stars, counting Real Madrid ace Ruud van Nistelrooy, American football sensation Bruce Smith, and even the King of Spain among his clients. \"I just think he understands the athletes, the significance of the injuries and he's able to deal with the personalities that go along with these injuries,\" Hargreaves told CNN.   Watch Owen Hargreaves talking about his recovery \u00bb . Steadman works with a team of 75 doctors who have together repaired some 16,000 knees. He has developed pioneering knee treatments, including \"micro-fracturing,\" which involves making a small hole in a patient's bone to draw out marrow blood, allowing the patient's own stem cells and growth factors to make new cartilage. Dr. Steadman says the secret to healing athletes is letting them do what they do best. \"I became convinced early in my career that mobility was important and immobility was a bad thing. \"I was one of the first ones to say, 'I don't think we'll use casts, we'll work on braces, we'll try to get motion back',\" he told CNN. Owen Hargreaves has about a month left of rehab in Vail. His days follow a strict routine: Wake up, rehab, eat lunch, rehab, eat dinner and rest. \"It's been frustrating at times,\" says Hargreaves. \"I don't really watch our games because as an athlete, and being so competitive, it's hard to watch when you normally would be out there.\" Steadman says Hargreaves will return to football next season better than ever, adding that athletes often build inner strength from overcoming what could be a career-ending injuries. Hargreaves shares that view. \"I'm going to come back stronger and hopefully add a couple of years onto my career,\" he said. For others the road to recovery can be slower. British middleweight boxer Michael Watson almost died after collapsing at the end of his 1991 title fight with Chris Eubank. \"I took a punch, everything went blank and I woke up in a bed. I thought I was dreaming,\" Watson told CNN. Watson spent the next 40 days in a coma and had to undergo six brain operations. Neurosurgeon Peter Hamlyn, who operated on Watson, told CNN, \"He was as close to death as I think it's possible to go, and survive. And he stayed there for longer than anyone I've ever known.\" It was thought that Watson would never walk again, but after years of slow recovery, he was able to enter the 2003 London Marathon, completing it over six days. \"His [recovery] is by far the most remarkable I've ever seen,\" said Hamlyn. There's now a close bond between Hamlyn and Watson, and Steadman's patients are similarly grateful for their recoveries. The hallway of Steadman's clinic is lined with the signed shirts of his former patients; the number 10 Manchester United shirt signed by Ruud van Nistelrooy reads simply \"Thank you for giving back my dream.\"", "f40f182d0286b265e947cfed5f110798bdfc05a7": "(CNN) -- The ambush by up to a dozen gunmen of a bus carrying members of the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore is the realization of fears long held by the sport's leading players. Pakistani policemen outside The National Stadium after masked gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore on March 3, 2009. The Sri Lankan team had agreed to tour Pakistan after India pulled out in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai last November when more than 160 people died in a three-day siege. The England team was in India -- but not in Mumbai -- during the attacks and promptly cut their tour short and returned home. In September 2008, Cricket Australia decided to push ahead with a tour of India despite a series of bomb attacks in the country's capital New Delhi. In March of the same year, they had pulled out of a tour of Pakistan after a spate of suicide bombings. Before that, the Australian team had not played in Pakistan for 10 years. Such was the concern about the security risks presented to players in Pakistan that in August 2008 the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced the biennial Champions Trophy would be postponed until October 2009. The ICC announced last month that it was investigating other venues after three countries -- England, New Zealand and Australia -- expressed reservations about touring Pakistan. South Africa pulled out of the 2008 competition citing security concerns. Long before that, in 2002, a suicide bomb blast outside the New Zealand team's hotel prompted them to pack up and abandon the second Test series in Pakistan. The explosion injured the team physiotherapist and killed 11 French navy experts as well as two Pakistanis. The previous year, the New Zealand team cancelled a scheduled tour of Pakistan in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in the U.S. Most of the team stayed on to play, though under increased security, when a suicide attack closed Colombo's international airport in July 2001. In February 1996, Australia and the West Indies refused to play in preliminary World Cup matches in Sri Lanka after a huge bomb blast killed 80 people and injured 1,200 in Colombo. In November 1992, also in Colombo, a suicide bomber detonated a bomb outside a hotel where the New Zealand team was having breakfast, killing four people. Five players and the coach were allowed to return home on compassionate grounds. Five years earlier, in April 1987, the New Zealand team cut short a three-test tour of Sri Lanka after a car bomb killed 100 people at a bus station in Colombo.", "e504e45eadbfeb87ca390c54d37aac9526c1504c": "Editor's note: CNN has asked its journalists across the country to offer their thoughts on how the economic crisis is affecting their cities. In this installment, All Platform Journalist Jim Spellman reports from Denver, Colorado. Hari Dallakoti says business at his UPS store in Denver, Colorado, is down 25 percent. DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- The conventional wisdom here in the Mile High City is that Denver entered the recession early and is pulling out of it ahead of the rest of the country. Time and again I have heard politicians, journalists and business people tell me that it isn't so bad here, that Denver is poised to lead the nation in an economic recovery. Maybe, but the signs on the ground are a little harder to read. Down on Broadway I stop by a UPS store a couple of times a week. The owner's name is Hari Dallakoti. Dallakoti always has a smile on his face and seems to know all his customers by name -- he was calling out to me by the second time I entered the shop. People drop by to ship out packages, make copies and pick up deliveries. There is always a crowd when I have been in, but Dallakoti tells me business is down 25 percent this month versus the same time last year. \"Finally it's hitting in this area, and I believe that people are afraid of spending money,\" he says. \"It's like a ripple effect, and I think I am feeling it now.\" Dallakoti says customers who once sent birthday presents across the country are now only sending cards. Also, eBay-related shipping is down, and he has seen a falloff in people sending mortgage-related documents. He has five employees and says he hasn't had to let anyone go, but he has had to cut back their hours. He agrees that business is better in Denver than in other parts of the country and is confident he will weather the economic storm, but it may be a while before things get better for him. \"In my opinion it's going to get worse for the next couple, three months, and I'm hoping it will turn around after June,\" he says.  Watch how the downturn is affecting Denver \u00bb . A block up Broadway is a little guitar store called Music Gear Guys. I play guitar, and this was one of the first businesses I stopped by when I moved to Denver in January. I have been in the shop four or five times and have been surprised that every time I drop by, the place is packed. \"The recession affected us a little last year but overall -- knock on wood -- it hasn't really affected me too much,\" says owner Gregory Decker, who thinks the recession may actually be helping his business. \"I have a feeling that people are looking for hobbies or different forms of entertainment that aren't too expensive,\" Decker explains. His store is crowded with new and used guitars, amplifiers and accessories. He says guitars based on designs from the 1960s are the hot items in the store. Like Dallakoti, the UPS store owner, Decker seems to know all of his customers by name. He says that in this economy you have to focus on customer service to stand a chance. He doesn't advertise, instead relying on word of mouth, and keeps overhead low: He is the sole employee. \"Relationships are what make my business thrive. Without them I wouldn't be as successful,\" he says. But even here in a relatively successful small business there are signs of the hard times other people have been experiencing. Beginning last year more customers started coming in to sell Decker their guitars in hopes of making ends meet. \"A lot of people are selling their gear due to job layoffs and needed the money,\" he says. The recession started with free-falling housing values and, in this respect, the signs are harder to read. Over the weekend I took my dog for a walk through my neighborhood near Sloans Lake in Northwest Denver and decided to count how many houses were for sale. In a six-block walk, I counted two houses for rent and 13 for sale, including the house next door to me. These homes sit like ghosts in the neighborhood. There are open houses on Sundays, but few people come by. The houses are all well-maintained, though most of them appear to be empty. My neighbors hope these places don't fall into foreclosure; they are worried the neighborhood will fall apart if they do. I'll be keeping my eye on the house next door, and keeping my fingers crossed that my new hometown will be back on track soon.", "c1ffdf8a75b64f8d7810b93240e9b32c0cd8c949": "(Travel + Leisure) -- Nothing, but nothing, has the power to spoil New Orleans' appetite.

Here, a meal-by-meal primer of the Big Easy from a lucky visitor who came to eat and stayed to listen. A classic meat biscuit at Mother's . Breakfast . When local business owners pulled together in move-on mode and reopened faster than seemed possible after Hurricane Katrina, natives dubbed Magazine Street, a six-mile ribbon of shops and restaurants, the \"aisle of denial.\" Only a few blocks away, on the edge of the Central Business District, Mother's reopened with Vice Admiral Thad Allen, head of the disaster relief effort, as its first customer. Regulars and tourists alike line up to order at the counter, cafeteria-style, but dishes such as grits and debris (roast-beef edges in gravy) or red-bean omelets with baked ham and biscuits are delivered to your Formica-topped table by old-time waitresses who may well call you darlin'. Mellow Coffea Caf\u00e9 (3218 Dauphine St.), in Bywater, a picturesque residential neighborhood a mile or so downriver from the French Quarter, doubles as a gallery space for local artists and has a genuine bohemian charm. Try their caf\u00e9 au lait (equal parts chicory coffee and steamed milk), sweet potato pancakes, or the savory \"huevos crepe,\" filled with eggs and black beans and served with a side of Southern hospitality: a half-dozen bottles of hot sauce, including the tangy Louisiana favorite, Crystal. iReport.com: Send your photos of New Orleans . Don't leave the neighborhood without swinging by homey corner restaurant Elizabeth's for fried chicken livers with pepper jelly or lacquered praline bacon, baked in brown sugar with crumbled pecans and tasting -- if you can imagine it -- like pig candy.

Travel + Leisure: World's craziest party towns . Lunch . Founded in 1919 by Italian immigrants, Casamento's takes pride in its oyster loaf: a sandwich of fried oysters layered between two slices of house-made buttery white bread (rather than a French-style po' boy roll). But check the calendar, because the tiny Garden District oyster house is only open in the cooler \"r\" months. If the time is right, plunk those freshly shucked oversize warm-water oysters onto some saltines and wash them down with the coldest local Abita Golden beer in town. During the summer \"r-less\" months, there's always La Petite Grocery (4238 Magazine St.), a cozy neighborhood bistro nearby. Chef Justin Devillier's top-notch half-pound burger comes with his house-made pickles and sweet Vidalia-onion marmalade. There's only one way to end the debate over where to find the best po' boy in town: head for the Parkway Bakery & Tavern. Whether you go for the roast beef with gravy or golden fried shrimp, the basic anatomy of Parkway's perfect rendition is always the same: \"dressed\" (lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and pickles) on distinctive New Orleans-style French bread (lightly crisped crust, interior as airy as cotton candy) from the celebrated Leidenheimer Bakery. Nothing better, nowhere else. A grande dame of French Creole cooking since 1905, and still family-owned, the clubby Galatoire's has long earned its place in the social scene.

Under sparkling chandeliers in a renovated four-story French-Creole warehouse, James Beard Award-winning chef John Besh, whose August empire has doubled in size post-Katrina, celebrates regional ingredients in French style. A devoted Louisiana resident, Besh is involved with artisanal producers and longtime area farmers, which means you might find a salad of heirloom beets with Allen Benton's cherrywood bacon, mustard greens, quail eggs, and black-eyed pea croutons, or a sugar-and-spice duckling with Anson Mills heirloom Carolina corn grits, roasted duck foie gras, and quince. Don't let the phrase \"contemporary Cajun\" scare you; there's no trickery about the food at Cochon. Devoted to protecting old-style traditions, chef/co-owners Donald Link and Stephen Stryjewski turn out splendid boudin, andouille, and smoked bacon, which you can also buy at the newly opened Butcher, located in the same building. Order absolutely anything: wood-fired oyster roast, ham hock with lima bean hopping John, catfish court bouillon. And whatever you do, don't leave without trying the fresh chunk-pineapple and cornmeal upside-down cake, slightly sticky with caramel sauce. The last bite will haunt you for days. Between meals . Beignet rhymes with clich\u00e9 for a reason: everybody hits Caf\u00e9 Du Monde, a cornerstone of the historic French Market since 1862, sometime. Despite the crowds, it's hard to find fault with the hot little pillows of sweet fried dough, served 24 hours a day, seven days a week (except Christmas Day). Paris, Milan, New Orleans?

Bangladeshi soldiers carry a coffin during a funeral Monday for victims of last week's mutiny. The earlier number was based on \"assumptions,\" said Lt. Gen. Sina Ibn Jamali, the army chief of general staff. \"The numbers we are giving now are grounded in facts,\" Jamali told reporters Sunday night. Authorities said confusion arose because no one knew for sure how many officers were inside the Bangladesh Rifles headquarters when paramilitary troops, or jawans, staged a bloody revolt and took dozens of them hostage Wednesday. Search crews have recovered 73 bodies from a river, sewers and three mass graves inside the Rifles compound in the Pilkhana area of the capital, Dhaka. Of those bodies, 53 were confirmed as those of army officers. Meanwhile, an army investigation into the 35-hour rebellion began Monday. The police have filed murder charges against more than 1,000 Rifles, and soldiers were out in full force throughout Bangladesh looking for them. The 65,000-strong Rifles is a border security force -- distinct from the army, but whose commanders are career army officers. The jawans had complained for years that their army superiors dismissed their appeals for more pay, subsidized food and the opportunity to participate in U.N. peacekeeping operations, which pay far more than what they make at home. The two-day standoff ended after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina promised the jawans amnesty if they laid down their arms. She has backtracked since, saying the government will not show mercy to those who killed, looted or committed arson.", "f3fc658691c64c1f2e8b25a66eec4feb8845bf12": "(CNN) -- Your saliva is doing all kinds of useful things for you all the time -- for instance, helping you chew and taste food. It's also home to more than 600 species of bacteria, which are harmlessly enjoying the moisture of your mouth. There's a slew of bacteria floating around in your mouth, but it's generally harmless. Since people have different eating habits in different places, you might think an American's saliva might look a lot different from, say, a South African's. But a new study published in the journal Genome Research finds that bacteria in saliva may not be as related to environment and diet as you might think. In fact, researchers found that the human salivary microbiome -- that is, the community of bacteria in saliva -- does not vary greatly between different geographic locations. That means your saliva is just as different from your neighbor's as someone's on the other side of the planet. \"It was somewhat surprising to us, because in our sampling we didn't control for diet, or environment, or anything like that,\" said Mark Stoneking of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and co-author of the study. Now, Stoneking and colleagues are trying to figure out why. One theory is that since the researchers looked only at the genus of the bacteria in question, they might find more differences at the level of individual species. They are investigating this in a follow-up study. Stoneking became interested in surveying the bacteria of saliva when he learned that saliva contains more DNA than blood, if you include DNA of bacteria and other organisms.  Human blood, as you might guess, still contains more human DNA than saliva.  Watch CNN's Elizabeth Landau talk more about saliva \u00bb . Researchers took saliva samples from a total of 120 healthy subjects. The countries represented in this sample were Germany, Poland, Turkey, Georgia, China, Philippines, South Africa, Republic of the Congo, Argentina, Bolivia and the United States. This was the first global survey of bacteria diversity in human saliva. The most common type of bacteria found in the survey of saliva was Streptococcus, Stoneking said. People typically have Streptococcus in their mouths living benignly, although certain species are responsible for diseases such as strep throat, meningitis and bacterial pneumonia. Why do you need hundreds of bacteria species in your mouth? It turns out they're mostly not helping you at all -- you're just giving them a warm, moist home. \"Having those bacteria -- that's the price we have to pay for having a lot of saliva in the mouth to begin with,\" said Nate Dominy, anthropologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Dominy, who has studied enzymes in saliva, found the results surprising, and said no one had previously surveyed the variety of bacteria in saliva. What else is inside saliva? One component of saliva that has been shown to vary according to diet is amylase, the only digestive enzyme that converts starch into sugar, Dominy said. Amylase is also found in the pancreas and the small intestine. The human body evolved to start the digestive process early, in the mouth, so we can maximize the amount of sugar that we take in, Dominy said. \"Given that we have such large brains, and our brains are metabolically very demanding tissues, they're extremely costly and expensive to maintain, so we need a lot of sugar,\"  he said. Americans in particular have a lot of amylase in their saliva because their diets are full of starch: chips, rice and baked potatoes. But the Pygmies of central Africa, for example, eat mostly game animals, honey and fruit. They have relatively little amylase in their saliva. Dominy and colleagues found these differences at the genetic level, meaning natural selection has favored large quantities of amylase in populations with starchy diets. But there is also evidence that amylase levels can rise and fall within an individual's lifetime. A study on college students in Ghana, who typically eat a lot of meat at the university, found that students who had grown up eating traditional starchy Ghanaian home-cooked meals had lower levels of amylase after attending the school. Humans have had starch as an important part of their diet for at least 12,000 years, since the advent of agriculture, he said. So what else is spit good for? Saliva spreads molecules to the taste receptors on the tongue so you can tell whether something is salty, sour, sweet or spicy, Dominy said. It also helps soften food and spread it to your teeth so that you don't have to chew as hard. Compared with other animals, humans are not very good at detecting toxins, he said. As a result, humans vomit much more than other species, and saliva buffers the acid that results from throwing up -- meaning you'll likely salivate immediately beforehand to limit the damage. \"A lot of the value of saliva is attributable to the fact that, in human evolution, we've had to eat marginal plant foods, things that are marginal in quality and full of toxins, and we need these particular salivary adaptations to help cope with those types of food,\" he said.", "82f8c01db091300db3c124543317cd825b441cbe": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The UK government has clashed with the judiciary amid claims that Washington pressured London into not releasing documents that reveal the torture of a terrorism suspect, UK media report. Binyam Mohamed has been held at Guantanamo Bay for more than four years. Ethiopian Binyam Mohamed, 30, formerly resident in the UK, has been held at Guantanamo Bay since September 2004. Allegations that he he was involved in a plot to release a \"dirty bomb\" in the United States have now been withdrawn. Mohamed and his supporters allege he was tortured in Pakistan, Morocco and Afghanistan between 2002 and 2004, and that the UK security services were complicit. UK media outlets had appealed against an earlier ruling to withhold documents relating to the alleged torture. Two UK High Court judges said Wednesday, in comments reported by the UK's Press Association, that the papers would still not be disclosed after UK foreign minister David Miliband warned their publication might affect intelligence sharing between the U.S. and UK. In their ruling, reported by PA, the judges said the documents included information \"relevant to allegations of torture,\" but added that they did not contain any sensitive intelligence. Rather, the judges concluded, the material was \"politically embarrassing\" and urged the new U.S. administration to take a different approach. The judges also suggested the U.S. government had pressured London about the intelligence-sharing relationship should the documents be released. Miliband told the UK's Channel 4 News Wednesday that intelligence co-operation between nations relied on confidentiality and that there would have been repercussions if the papers had been released. But he added: \"There has been no threat from the United States to 'break off' intelligence cooperation.\" \"In this case, the United States made clear, in documents that have been published, that there would inevitably be serious and lasting harm if that fundamental principle was breached,\" Miliband said.  \"It is American information and it is for the Americans to decide when to publish their information.\"  The UK government has peviously pressed for the release of Mohamed. Last month U.S. President Barack Obama set a one-year deadline for the closure of Guantanamo. Clive Stafford Smith, lawyer for Mohamed, said in a statement on the Web site of human rights group Reprieve that the U.S. and the UK governments were legally obliged to investigate any allegations of torture. \"For the foreign secretary to give in to these illegal demands by the Bush Administration is capitulation to blackmail, pure and simple. It is hardly Britain's finest hour. As the judges say, it is up to President Obama to put his money where his mouth is. He must repudiate his predecessor's reprehensible policy.\" Earlier this week Miliband met with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for talks in Washington. Clinton told media after her meeting that the U.S.-UK relationship stood the test of time, adding: \"Our two countries have stood side by side confronting global challenges for a very long time. We share fundamental values and important fundamental objectives.\"", "ce3fcbe4b8f0c54dce1899d2b4c1b948a3204f27": "MODESTO, California (CNN)  -- Some of the people hit hardest by this bad economy are the youngest. Almost 2 million children nationwide have had or will have their lives disrupted by home foreclosures, according to one study. There are more empty desks in Suzell Tougas's fourth grade classroom after 10 students have stopped coming. These are the children whose families have had to move, sometimes more than once. The youngsters are pulled out of school, often leaving their friends behind without even saying goodbye. Nine-year-old Kenia, who is in the fourth grade at Fairview Elementary School in Modesto, California, said that is what happened to her. She is new to the school, having moved to the area just a few months ago. She said it is really hard and she misses her friends. Her classmate Bethany said her best friend since kindergarten just left without saying goodbye. Heather Sharp, the principal at Fairview, said her school has been the one most affected by the bad economy in the Modesto City School system. \"We have, over the last couple of months, 50 students coming new to the school and 50 students leaving,\" Sharp said. It was so bad that the school conducted a door-to-door search for missing students, she said. \"We had our community aide going out to houses. And they were boarded up, windows boarded, yard brown. She had to go to neighbors to find out where the kids were.\" In terms of raw numbers, California had the most foreclosures of any state from 2007 through January 2009. More than 57,000 homes entered foreclosure. Many of those were in Stanislaus County, where home prices have declined 65 percent since December 2005, according to the Modesto Bee. Fourth-grade teacher Suzell Tougas said she has lost 10 kids from her class so far this year and is braced to lose more. She usually has a room full of children with every desk occupied. Now, it \"looks empty ... it's like a \"ghost town\". She said constant moving is hard on kids. \"Just having to start over and start over is really hard on a child,\" Tougas said. \"It takes six weeks for a child to adjust ... at least.\" While children are in that period of adjustment, she said, they aren't learning and their studies suffer. \"The biggest issue is that when [children have to move] when there are other stressors going on, we know it puts these kids at greater risk for being behind in their academics,\" said Pat Popp, a past president of the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth. That is borne out in a recent study by a nonpartisan group in Washington called First Focus. It said that children who move twice in one year are only half as likely as others to be able to read proficiently, and may have a greater chance of being held back. It also found that  moving a lot reduces the student's chance of graduating from high school by half. Read the report here . The report, published in May, estimated that 1.95 million children will be affected by foreclosure over the next two years. The number of homeless students is increasing dramatically. A study by the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children reported that more than 450 school districts across the nation had an increase of at least 25 percent in the number of identified homeless students between the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 school years. Read the report here (pdf) A student who moves \"may hear the same information again that you learned in your previous classroom or miss information that has already been covered in your class but wasn't taught in your previous school,\" Popp said. The fallout from the rash of foreclosures likely will have a long-term impact on education, especially in California. Schools get much of their funding from property tax revenues. Real estate values are spiraling downward and so is the revenue. At Fairview Elementary, Principal Sharp worries about students like 9-year-old Eunice, who has moved twice in the last year. Her parents told her that after they pay their mortgage this month, they won't have any money for a week. But, Sharp said, children are resilient. \"We don't give them credit for what they can handle but, at the same time, the flip side is it's sad -- they shouldn't have to handle it. They should be able to know they can go to school and focus on reading and math and recess.\"", "bd03b29cddbee1cd9855f3712367303de0490bb0": "Children and teens who have a parent with bipolar disorder are 14 times more likely than their peers to have bipolar-like symptoms themselves, and are two to three times more likely to be found to have an anxiety or mood disorder, such as depression, according to a report in the March issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry. More than 10 percent of the kids with a bipolar parent had signs of a bipolar-spectrum, mood or anxiety disorder. When both parents are bipolar, children are 3.6 times more likely to have bipolar disorder than children with only one parent with the psychiatric condition. Bipolar disorder, which is also known as manic-depressive illness, affects 5.7 million people over age 18 in the United States. The condition is characterized by extreme fluctuations in energy, mood, and the ability to function. For example, someone experiencing an \"episode\" may have a manic state of euphoria for a period of time, followed by a bout of severe depression. Although bipolar disorder may run in families, it's not guaranteed that children of bipolar parents will develop the condition too. \"I don't want parents to think 'I have bipolar, so my kids have bipolar,'\" says Boris Birmaher, M.D., of the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and author of the new study, called the Pittsburgh Bipolar Offspring Study. \"Yes, these kids are at a higher risk, but that doesn't necessarily mean your child will have it.\" Health.com: Bipolar disorder is different for women . In the study, Birmaher and colleagues looked at 233 parents with bipolar disorder and their 388 children, ages 6 to 18. They were compared with a control group of 143 parents and 251 children with no family history of the condition. Overall, 10.6 percent of the children with a bipolar parent had signs of a bipolar spectrum disorder (which includes a range of symptoms from severe to less so) or a mood or anxiety disorder. In comparison, only two children, or 0.8 percent, in the control group had such symptoms. It's not clear whether genes, environment or a combination of both are responsible for the link, or possibly greater awareness and diagnosis of psychiatric conditions in bipolar families. Health.com: How a bipolar patient learned to manage mania . However, Birmaher says identifying the condition at an earlier age may ultimately help young people. \"The longer you wait, the more complicated the condition could become,\" Birmaher says. Previous studies have suggested that it can take 10 years of symptoms before people get a correct diagnosis and proper treatment. \"Ten years is a long time -- especially in the life of a child,\" he says. The condition is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can be mistaken for depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or one of the disruptive behavior disorders. Signs of a manic episode include increased energy, extreme irritability, racing thoughts, spending sprees, abuse of drugs (particularly cocaine), and increased sexual drive. A depressive episode may range from disruptive sleeping patterns to thoughts of death or suicide. \"The chronic highs and lows are only two manifestations of the condition,\" says Gary Sachs, M.D., director of the bipolar clinic and research program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \"But there are plenty of people who live a full, functional life and still have bipolar disorder.\" Health.com: How to care for and cope with a bipolar spouse .

Health.com: My story: I'm bipolar and struggle with addiction . \"This study in no way should be a reason for someone with bipolar not to have children,\" says Sachs. \"But there is a risk and that might make someone's child who has difficulty seek help sooner.\" In adults with bipolar disorder, up to 60 percent say they had their first symptoms before the age of 21. \"Bipolar disorder is a multidimensional condition, and it can affect a lot of things including your physical health,\" says Sachs. \"That is what we are learning from studies like this where you begin to see other psychiatric conditions.\" The National Institute of Mental Health funded the study.

U.S. Air Force nurse Nonnie Dotson disappeared on the way to the mall on November 19, 2006. Dotson, 33, was staying with her brother at his home outside Denver, Colorado, when she vanished on November 19, 2006. She was supposed to meet friends at the mall for a smoothie. She never showed. The single mother and her 16-month-old daughter, Savannah, lived in San Antonio, Texas, where Dotson worked on a military base as an intensive care nurse. They were staying with Dotson's brother, Tony, for a few days.  Watch why Dotson's disappearance puzzles investigators \u00bb . Dotson had recently emerged from a court battle with Ed Vehle, Savannah's father. Vehle, who also lived in San Antonio, was ordered by the court to pay $10,000 in back child support, as well as $900 each month. Dotson won the court order two months before she disappeared. Dotson was just months away from completing her military duty and was trying to decide whether she would move back to her hometown in Colorado or remain in San Antonio. Vehle had declared he had no interest in being a part of their lives. The two met in 2004 and the relationship ended when Dotson became pregnant. Vehle did not want her to have the baby, she told friends at the military base. The friends spoke on condition that their identities would not be made public. Vehle is not a suspect or person of interest in the case, police said. Because things appeared to be going well in Dotson's life, her sudden disappearance is a mystery to her family and to police. She was hundreds of miles away from home in a safe Denver suburb. She left her brother's home on Sunday afternoon, and the mall was within walking distance,Tony Dotson said. \"She asked me to look after Savannah for a couple hours and she walked out that door and we never saw her again,\" Tony Dotson added. \"She would never have intentionally left Savannah behind like that.\" Police agree. Since Dotson vanished, there has been no activity on her bank accounts, credit cards or cell phone, police said. Her case is still an open missing persons investigation being handled by the Jefferson County homicide department. \"Unfortunately, we have no real leads as to who is responsible for Dotson's disappearance,\" said sheriff's office spokeswoman Jacki Kelley. \"She could be alive and being held against her will. She could have been kidnapped and then murdered. We are not ruling anything out at this time,\" Kelley said. For several weeks after Dotson's disappearance, Vehle refused to answer questions. He retained counsel. In mid-December 2006, Vehle and Jay Norton, his attorney, met with police, answering all their questions. Norton said they were able to provide investigators with receipts and cell phone records accounting for Vehle's whereabouts. Police confirmed that Vehle was nowhere near Colorado before, during or after Dotson's disappearance. After Dotson's disappearance, Vehle decided to go to court to pursue full custody of his daughter. Dotson's parents had been taking care of Savannah.

Refugees from Darfur gather at a camp in Chad. Sudan's president says the crisis in Darfur is a \"media fabrication.\" El-Bashir spoke at a news conference in Dubai following a three-day visit to the Persian Gulf emirate. He said the crisis in Sudan's western Darfur region is a \"media fabrication.\" El-Bashir's government has been blamed by the United Nations of supporting militias that conduct \"indiscriminate attacks\" on civilians in the Darfur region, including torture, rape, and killings. Rebels fighting the government-backed militias have also been accused by the U.N. of widespread human rights abuses. During Tuesday's news conference, el-Bashir restated his position that foreign intervention in Darfur was an obstacle in achieving peace in the region. The Sudanese president has been outspoken in his opposition to allowing non-African forces in Darfur. At the start of this year, more than 9,000 members of a joint UN-African Union peacekeeping force were deployed to the region to address the fighting and humanitarian suffering. The force will eventually number 26,000. Speaking on Tuesday, el-Bashir said that the fighting only affects 10 percent of the region. In the majority of Darfur, there is little to no conflict and people are living normal lives, he said. Citing Sudanese government statistics, el-Bashir said that less than 10,000 people have died in the conflict and less than 500,000 have been displaced. International figures, including United Nations' data, put the death toll in Darfur at approximately 200,000, with another 2.5 million people displaced by the violence since 2003. The conflict started five years ago when ethnic African tribesmen took up arms, complaining of decades of neglect and discrimination by the Sudanese government. Sudan's Arab-dominated government is accused of responding by unleashing the tribal militias known as janjaweed, which have committed the worst atrocities against Darfur's local communities. El-Bashir, however, rejected claims that the Darfur conflict is being fought along ethnic lines. E-mail to a friend .

Protesters demand democracy for Myanmar at a demonstration in New Delhi, India earlier this month. Among those released was Ma Khin Khin Leh, who was serving a life sentence because her husband, a student activist, had helped plan a protest demonstration in Bago in July 1999, according to Amnesty International USA's Web blog . Authorities prevented the demonstration from taking place, but took the woman and her three-year-old daughter into custody after failing to find her husband, Amnesty International said. The child was released after five days but her mom, a 33-year-old school teacher, was sentenced to life in prison. \"Even by the normally harsh standards of 'justice' meted out by Myanmar's military government, the life sentence given to Ma Khin Khin Leh was extreme,\" the human rights organization said. She was designated one of Amnesty International USA's priority cases. She was released with 18 others \"widely considered to be political prisoners,\" Amnesty International said. Myanmar's military rulers have been widely condemned for their alleged human rights abuses. Pro-democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi has been confined in her home for 12 of the past 18 years. Her last house arrest began in 2003 and has been periodically renewed. In October 2007, clashes erupted between pro-democracy demonstrators and government security forces. As many as 110 people are believed to have been killed in that crackdown, including 40 Buddhist monks. The protests were sparked by a huge fuel price increase imposed by the military government, and quickly escalated. Myanmar's military junta said in mid-October that it had detained more than 2,900 people amid the clashes. In September 2008, Amnesty International reported that Myanmar, also called Burma, had released seven dissidents, among them U Win Tin, a journalist and senior official in the opposition National League for Democracy who had been imprisoned for 19 years.", "fef9ba044558fb72ce94d96db641f54c5ff3990e": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- When stock markets are soaring, people think they're making money because they're geniuses. But when the market tanks -- which it always does, sooner or later -- people look for villains to blame for their losses. Allan Sloan says the real lesson of the Madoff case is not to rely on others to protect your investments. That brings us to Bernie Madoff, who has become the iconic symbol of the current horrible market and economic meltdown, even though he really had nothing to do with it. Yes, Madoff sure seems to be a really, really bad guy who ruined lots and lots of lives and should probably be locked up for the rest of his natural days. But Madoff's misdeeds -- or as our lawyers would prefer, his alleged misdeeds -- have nothing to do with the market meltdown that has sliced trillions of dollars from our collective net worth. He's become the symbol of the current meltdown the same way that uber-tastemaker Martha Stewart became a face of the 2001-02 corporate crime wave, even though the misdeeds of which she was convicted -- misleading government investigators -- were less than penny-ante compared to the multi-billion dollar frauds that first built up and then destroyed giant companies such as Enron and WorldCom. Along with Madoff, the Securities and Exchange Commission is being portrayed as the villain of the piece, having failed to catch him long ago when his alleged depredations must have been much smaller. Instead, it gave him a few wrist slaps until he confessed his misdeeds a month ago. But, tips from Boston money manager Harry Markopoulos over the years notwithstanding, it's not at all surprising that the SEC missed Madoff. In fact, I'd have been amazed if the SEC had been the ones to catch him. Why? I don't want to seem cynical or jaded, but after almost 40 years of covering business news, I've seen the same thing happen over and over because of the way regulators are trained. If someone runs a little bit out of the baseline by chiseling on numbers or playing some other game, regulators are pretty good at catching him (or her). But if -- like Madoff -- you make up numbers from scratch and deal with huge sums, you're so far out of the baseline that regulators aren't looking for you there. It's very hard for an SEC regulator to wrap his head around the idea that an establishment guy like Madoff -- a Nasdaq market pioneer and an occasional consultant to the SEC -- is capable of just making things up out of whole cloth. But, it would appear, he was. And as an aside, it's easy to blame George W. Bush's anti-regulation policies for the SEC not catching Madoff. But Markopoulos' original tips reached the SEC when Bill Clinton was president. Like newspapers, where I used to work, regulators get all sorts of tips coming across the transom. As in newspapers, I suspect, many of the tips end up ignored. Markopoulos was right about Madoff's operation being a fraud. But his magnum opus -- an 18-page 2005 letter listing 29 \"red flags\" -- is quite dense and confusing, probably because he'd gotten frustrated after years of not being taken very seriously. Unfortunately, the letter didn't list what would have been (in hindsight, naturally) the simplest tip-off: that this supposedly multi-billion dollar operation was audited by an obscure three-person accounting firm. As Jim Heatherington, a Tulsa, Oklahoma, certified public accountant, pointed out to me after reading a Madoff column I wrote for Fortune, a simple database search shows that the firm hadn't had a peer review since 1990. That would -- or should -- have set off all sorts of alarm bells. Back to the main event. Ponzi schemes, in which you pay existing investors not by making a profit but by getting money from new investors, have been around forever. Like Madoff, a Jew who preyed on fellow Jews and Jewish charities such as Elie Wiesel's foundation, Ponzi schemers often target their own religious or ethnic groups. That way, they lure victims who feel flattered at having been asked to join an elite society, so much so that many of them fail to find out basic things, such as whether the securities or properties they're supposedly being put into actually exist. Consider these: Tom Petters, a prominent Minnesota businessman is charged with running a multi-billion dollar scam that preyed on evangelical Christians. A New York City man was recently accused of preying on fellow members of a Hispanic church. A Haitian-American in Miami was accused on December. 30 of preying on other Haitian-Americans. Just yesterday, the SEC accused a Williamsville, N.Y., man of preying on fellow Catholics. If someone, especially a member of your racial, religious or social group, offers you a deal not available to the general public, check it out. Very diligently. Don't rely on the SEC or any other regulator to do that for you. Never, never, never put all your eggs in one basket, no matter how good it looks. And that, my friends, is the real bottom line. Pillory Madoff and mock him all you like, he has it coming. But learn from him, too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Allan Sloan.", "03765604d9073697904c2dc4cf29e90b924f36f0": "(CNN) -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced the resignations Tuesday of three high-level government officials, most notably Communications and Transport Secretary Luis Tellez Kuenzler. The government of Mexican President Felipe Calderon, seen here in January, is facing elections in July. Abraham Gonzalez, a key official for the powerful ministry that oversees Mexico's government, also resigned. So did Sergio Vela Martinez, president of the National Council for Culture and the Arts. No official reasons were given for any of the resignations, which analysts said did not appear to be related. But at least two of the resignations did not come as a surprise. Tellez, who stepped down from a Cabinet-level post, had been involved for weeks in a controversy over taped comments revealed last month by CNN journalist Carmen Aristegui. In the taped conversation, Tellez said former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had stolen government money. Salinas has not been formally accused of any crime. Tellez received an anonymous threat in late February from an apparent political enemy telling him to resign or more damaging audiotapes would be released to the media. He refused and turned the matter over to authorities. Ana Maria Salazar Slack, a political analyst who is host of a daily radio show in Mexico City, called it \"an almost soap opera-ish scandal\" that left Calderon little choice but to force Tellez to resign. \"Although Calderon wanted to keep him in office, it made it very difficult to keep him there,\" she said. Calderon moved Tellez to a post as a presidential aide dealing with economic matters. Other observers also were not surprised by the move. \"That was waiting to happen,\" said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center. \"But evidently the president values his counsel and has kept him in a high-profile position in the presidency from which he'll continue to have influence.\" Robert Pastor, the Latin America national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s, praised Tellez but said political considerations prevailed. \"He's a very competent fellow,\" Pastor said. \"One of the most competent people I've known in Mexico. But this tape in particular was very embarrassing.\" In a televised news conference after Calderon announced the changes, Tellez expressed his \"gratitude for this opportunity that few Mexicans obtain.\" Replacing Tellez will be Juan Molinar Horcasitas, the head of the Mexican Institute for Social Security. Molinar belongs to the same party as Calderon, the National Action Party [PAN], while Tellez belongs to the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI]. That played a role, Slack said. \"The president is sending a signal to his party that he's going to support people from his own party,\" Slack said. \"Beyond the political scandals of the tapes, there's a decision for the president to appoint people very close to the party.\" Gonzalez's departure was not a surprise either, since he is running for a congressional seat in July and Mexican law requires him to resign. Analysts spoke highly of Gonzalez's replacement, Geronimo Gutierrez Fernandez. He had been the top person in the foreign ministry for Latin and North America. \"Gutierrez moving in is outstanding,\" the Mexico Institute's Selee said, calling him \"one of the smartest people ... I've met\" and \"an impressive guy.\" Consuelo Saizar Guerrero takes over as head of the National Council for Culture and the Arts, replacing Vela, whose reasons for resigning were not disclosed. Saizar previously served as head of the Economic Culture Fund, the government's book-publishing enterprise. The arts and culture post will play a significant role in 2010, when Mexico celebrates 100 years of its social revolution and 200 years of its declaration of independence, radio analyst Slack said. As for the timing of resignations from three key posts, Slack linked it to Mexico's election calendar. \"In order to understand these changes,\" she said, \"you have to understand there are midterm elections in July. So if there are going to be any changes, they have to take place right now.\" Meanwhile, Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue, said the changes do not portend a political shift. \"This doesn't sound like any major direction in change for Calderon,\" Hakim said.", "0855d22a73d652b037a9424aef66d60077163ab2": "(CNN) -- Whether it's dining, shopping, culture, nightlife or people, everybody has a favorite city.

Salmonella bacteria are transmitted to humans by eating contaminated foods. The infection may have contributed to three deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. \"Preliminary analysis of an epidemiologic study conducted by CDC and public health officials in multiple states comparing foods eaten by ill and well persons has suggested peanut butter as a likely source,\" the disease agency said in a written statement. \"To date, no association has been found with common brand names of peanut butter sold in grocery stores.\" A spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration said Monday that the agency has been collaborating with the CDC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and public health officials in many states to investigate the outbreak of infections due to Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. \"This new information from Minnesota will not change what we are currently doing as part of the investigation,\" said FDA spokesman Michael Herndon.  What you need to know about food poisoning \u00bb . The Minnesota bacteria were linked last week to institutionally distributed peanut butter, sold under the King Nut brand name. In one of the Minnesota patients, a 70-year-old female nursing home resident, the infection proved fatal, said Doug Schultz, a Minnesota public health department spokesman. \"We do not know to what extent the salmonella contributed to the death,\" said Schultz, who added that the patient had other underlying illnesses. Virginia Health officials confirm that two of the three deaths linked to the salmonella outbreak were from their state. Although she could not provide a lot of information due to privacy laws, Michelle Peregoy, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Health tells CNN that one person who died was over age 65 and from the Southwest part of the state, the other person who died was a younger adult between the ages of 25-64. As with the Minnesota patient, both Virgina patients had underlying illnesses, which means they had weakended immune systems. Very young people, older people and those with compromised immune systems are the most vulnerable to severe side effects, including death. Late last week, King Nut Companies, based in Ohio, recalled King Nut peanut butter. President and CEO Martin Kanan said the product is manufactured by a Lynchburg, Virginia-based company, Peanut Corporation of America. \"King Nut took this action as soon as it was informed that salmonella had been found in an open five-pound tub of King Nut peanut butter,\" the company said Saturday in a posting on its Web site. King Nut, which distributes peanut butter through food service accounts, does not sell directly to consumers. Kanan said King Nut has asked customers to stop distributing peanut butter with lot codes beginning with \"8\" and has canceled orders with the manufacturer. The first cases nationwide were reported September 3, but most occurred between October 1 and December 31, the CDC said last week. About 18 percent of cases were hospitalized as a result of their illness, and patients have ranged from 2 months to 98 years of age. California has reported the highest case count with 55, followed by Ohio with 53, Massachusetts with 39, Minnesota with 30 and Michigan with 20. The other 37 states are each reporting from one to 19 cases. The seven states that have reported no cases connected to the outbreak are Montana, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Florida and Alaska. Strains of salmonella linked to outbreaks in the past have been traced to contaminated eggs, meat, poultry, vegetables, pet food and peanut butter. Contaminated tomatoes were blamed for an outbreak in the fall of 2006 caused by salmonella Typhimurium, which sickened at least 183 people in 21 states. Most people suffered from diarrhea and fever for about a week. No one is known to have died in that outbreak. Salmonella infections can be treated with antibiotics, though some strains are resistant to these drugs, according to the CDC. Most people infected develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within a few days of infection and the illness can last up to a week. Most recover without treatment, but some may suffer dehydration and, in severe cases, require hospitalization. Children, senior citizens, people with chronic illnesses and those with weak immune systems tend to be at highest risk for complications, according to the National Institutes of Health.

CNN's Christiane Amanpour says India and Pakistan might be warming toward each other. Chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour spoke about the situation. CNN: An attack this large, this sophisticated, and carried out with no warning could have come from inside India, maybe, maybe outside, maybe a neighboring state could be involved. We turn to Christiane Amanpour. What do you hear? Christiane Amanpour: Well, Tom, Islamic militants have been stepping up their assaults on Mumbai, which is not just the center of its filmmaking, but the economic and financial hub of India. They have often blamed terror attacks on Islamic militants based in Pakistan. Some, they say, are concerned about, for instance, Indian rule over Kashmir. Al Qaeda also has threatened to attack India in revenge for its policies. Very, very interestingly, this comes at a time when the new president of Pakistan has, in fact, gone further than any previous Pakistani leader in saying they want to improve relations with India, in saying they want to jointly combat terrorism together. The Pakistani president even went so far as saying he would consider renouncing a nuclear strike on India. This is a very confused situation. Although some group has claimed responsibility, nobody knows the motive yet. ... CNN: Talk to me about why it would be in the interest of these people to sever this tie between Pakistan and India. Do they believe India would join in the effort to squeeze them out? Amanpour: This is the ongoing situation. Certainly, Kashmir is a flashpoint for India and Pakistan, and really back in 2006, there were Islamic militants blamed for recent attacks. About 180 people were killed there. The one that came closest to pitting India against Pakistan was in 2001, when Islamic militants attacked the Parliament. Only 12 people were killed, but not compared to what's happened now, and that almost led to a war between India and Pakistan. Whatever happens in this region is so, so difficult and dangerous because of the flash point it centers on. As I say, though it has come at a time right in the aftermath of the warmest outreach by Pakistan to India in decades. ... CNN: What is, in all of this world picture, Christiane, what is the significance of this? Amanpour: Well, this is deeply significant, obviously, because it is such a complex and coordinated attack on multitudinous targets, multitudinous locations. Obviously, a large number of militants or terrorists who have taken part in this, and they have engaged the Indian forces, the police and security forces. It's not like they just put bombs somewhere and allowed them to go off, and either they were suicide attackers who got killed or they were able to remotely detonate their bombs. What they've done is not just attack, take hostages, but engage also with the security forces. So this really ratchets it up a very significant level. And it's been coming for about 20 years, these attacks. Small in the last couple of decades, but in the last 10 years or so, particularly since 9/11, there have been a number of very significant attacks blamed by the Indian forces on Islamic militants. ... This is very, very dangerous in this part of the world. Mumbai is India's not just gateway to the nation; it's its economic and financial hub, and it's its cultural hub as well, having the Bollywood and the other film production studios there. Nobody quite knows who it is and why they have done it. This is the thing that is very difficult and dangerous at the moment. This little-known group, if it's true that they exist, have claimed responsibility, although that has not been confirmed, so-called Deccan Mujahedeen, and what is the motive? There has obviously for many, many years been a type of feelings by India that, say, 150 or so million Muslims who are in the minority are feeling sort of hard done by in terms of the Hindu majority. There are also complaints by Indian Muslims about the way Kashmir is progressing, that enclave, and that is a huge, huge flashpoint. But what's really amazing is that often, it's blamed on tensions with Pakistan. And yet, this comes at a time where the president of Pakistan has -- the new president -- has really made an unprecedented overture to India in terms of trying to warm up relations, trying to secure a lasting peace. And just today, Indian and Pakistani officials were having meetings, and they ended it with a joint declaration that they wanted to cooperate on ending terrorism and combating terrorism. CNN: Christiane, do you see any connection with the recent American elections and this? Amanpour: Well, it's hard to tell. People would say that it takes a lot longer than a few weeks to plan something like this. It's difficult to tell. I'm sure there will be a huge amount of analysis in the upcoming days and weeks. What is going to be vital is whatever information the Indian security forces can get from some of these terrorists, militants, who've apparently some may have been captured alive. Obviously, there apparently have been some who have been killed as well. All of this will provide some of those missing pieces of the puzzle. Who are these people? What is their motive? Just today, there is an interview with the U.S. Marine Corps commandant as basically saying that al Qaeda's focus now is Pakistan. There had been some thought that maybe al Qaeda was in the past trying to launch its attacks also in India, but the Indian secret services and the security services say that they don't have a presence there. But Pakistan is a very, very big worry. It's a failing state. Afghanistan is practically a failed state right now, even after the U.S. in 2001 sent al Qaeda and the Taliban packing. There's a very difficult and dangerous situation on this subcontinent that really has been the focus of a lot of attention right now, and indeed, the incoming president has said that he wants to step up the number of U.S. forces. U.S. commanders want more forces in that region as well, not just Afghanistan, but to cope with Pakistan as well. CNN: As you said, there have been a lot of incidents since the year 2000 in India. Why is this one getting so much particular attention? There was one with over 200 deaths. Amanpour: Well, about 180 in 2006. But those were sort of multiple bombings in trains and railway stations. But this is one night with, so far, according to our sources, at least 87 people killed, and it's a brazen attack on the most visible elements and symbols and structures of the economic, the cultural, the tourist, the international hub, as I said, the gateway to India -- which is the world's largest democracy -- which is not a failed state by any stretch of the imagination. Which has a unified political structure, which has an army and security forces. India is not Pakistan or Afghanistan, and yet this has been able to happen here. And why is it getting so much attention? Because so many more people than ever before have been killed in one fell swoop, and it's ongoing, and these people launched pitched battles with the security forces, and they still have hostages, and it appears they deliberately targeted Westerners.", "f75073d5b4e22de4dfdbc7d28a3b2e0fec5f34a6": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani authorities have arrested two top leaders of the Islamic militant group India blames for the November massacre in Mumbai, Pakistan's prime minister confirmed Wednesday. Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said Pakistani security forces had rounded up a number of militant figures. The top military officer in the U.S. on Wednesday said he is \"encouraged\" by Pakistan's recent arrests of \"significant players\" in the Mumbai attacks. U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said the arrests amount to \"first steps\" toward determining who plotted the three day siege last month that killed 160 people in Mumbai, India's financial capital. \"There are more steps to follow,\" he noted. He also thanked India for showing restraint against Pakistan, which it has accused of harboring the terrorist groups behind the November massacre. Zarar Shah, a top operational commander of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, and Zakir Rehman Lakhvi, whose arrest had been reported Tuesday, were among the militant figures rounded up in recent days, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told reporters. Gilani would not confirm the detention of Masood Azhar, the leader of another militant group, Jaish-e-Muhammad. But he said his government has launched its own investigation into India's allegations that the gunmen who killed more than 160 people in Mumbai had links to Pakistan. The acknowledgment came three days after Pakistani security forces raided an LeT camp near Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, in the first sign of government action against Lashkar-e-Tayyiba since the three-day siege of India's financial capital. Both LeT and Jaish-e-Muhammad were formed to battle Indian rule in the divided Himalayan territory of Kashmir, and both were banned after a 2001 attack on the Indian parliament that brought the South Asian nuclear rivals to the brink of war. The United States has listed LeT as a terrorist group with ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. According to the U.S. government, Lakhvi, 47, has directed LeT's military operations in southeast Asia, Chechnya, Bosnia and Iraq. Pakistan's Defense Minister Choudhry Mukhtar Ahmed told CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN, that Lakhvi and Azhar had been arrested on Monday. Azhar has been in Pakistan since 1999, when he was released from an Indian prison in exchange for hostages aboard a hijacked Indian airliner. Indian authorities say the sole surviving gunman in the Mumbai attacks told investigators that he was trained at an LeT camp near Muzaffarabad, along with the nine other attackers who were killed in the three-day siege. A Pakistani security official said the terror raids on banned militant groups are ongoing and have resulted in at least 15 arrests.", "2e7750cfc27f95b2495c48dca085985ac615d0a3": "(CNN) -- Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated Thursday in Rawalpindi, was the first female prime minister of Pakistan and of any Islamic nation. She led Pakistan from 1988 to 1990 and again from 1993 to 1996. Benazir Bhutto died Thursday after a suicide bombing at a political rally in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Bhutto, 54, spent eight years in self-imposed exile in Great Britain and Dubai after President Farooq Leghari dismissed her second administration amid accusations of corruption, intimidation of the judiciary, a breakdown of law and order, and undermining the justice system. She was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to five years in prison. The conviction was later overturned but she remained in exile until this year. She returned to Pakistan in October after President Pervez Musharraf signed an amnesty lifting corruption charges.  Watch political history of Bhutto \u00bb . In a September 26 interview on CNN's \"The Situation Room,\" Bhutto said she expected threats against her life as she prepared to lead a push for the restoration of democracy in Pakistan. \"After military dictatorship an anarchic situation developed, which the terrorists and Osama (bin Laden) have exploited,\" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \"They don't want democracy, they don't want me back, and they don't believe in women governing nations, so they will try to plot against me. \"But these are risks that must be taken. I'm prepared to take them,\" she said. Bhutto narrowly escaped injury on October 18 when a suicide bombing near her convoy in Karachi killed 126 people. \"Soon thereafter, I was asked by authorities not to travel in cars with tinted windows -- which protected me from identification by terrorists -- or travel with privately armed guards,\" she wrote for CNN.com in November. \"I began to feel the net was being tightened around me when police security outside my home in Karachi was reduced, even as I was told that other assassination plots were in the offing.\" \"I decided not to be holed up in my home, a virtual prisoner,\" she wrote. \"I went to my ancestral village of Larkana to pray at my father's grave. Everywhere, the people rallied around me in a frenzy of joy. I feel humbled by their love and trust.\" Musharraf declared a state of emergency and placed Bhutto under house arrest twice in November as anti-government rallies grew in Rawalpindi. The arrest warrant was lifted November 16. She filed a nomination paper for a parliamentary seat on November 25 and appeared headed for a power showdown with Musharraf before she was assassinated Thursday.  See a timeline of Bhutto's political career \u00bb . Bhutto was the daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, former president and prime minister of Pakistan, who was hanged in 1979 for the murder of a political opponent two years after he was ousted as prime minister in a military coup. Benazir Bhutto was the de facto leader of her father's Pakistan People's Party. Her brother, Murtaza, was killed along with six others in a 1996 shootout with police at his home. Another brother, Shahnawaz, died mysteriously in France in 1985. \"I know the past is tragic, but I'm an optimist by nature,\" Bhutto told Blitzer in September. \"I put my faith in the people of Pakistan, I put my faith in God. I feel that what I am doing is for a good cause, for a right cause -- to save Pakistan from extremists and militants and to build regional security. \"I know the danger is out there, but I'm prepared to take those risks.\" Benazir Bhutto earned degrees from Radcliffe College and Oxford University and received an honorary degree from Harvard University in 1989. She leaves her husband of 20 years, Asif Ali Zardari, two daughters and a son. Bhutto's husband issued a statement Thursday from his home in Dubai saying, \"All I can say is we're devastated, it's a total shock.\" President Bush, on his ranch in Crawford, Texas, said Bhutto \"refused to allow assassins to dictate the course of her country.\" \"We stand with the people of Pakistan in their struggle against the forces of terror and extremism,\" Bush said. \"We urge them to honor Benazir Bhutto's memory by continuing with the democratic process for which she so bravely gave her life.\" E-mail to a friend .", "3938a0db6fa95bb57602fc86bb9dcf6bd77c734f": "(CNN) -- Authorities said they were searching the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai, India, on Saturday morning after killing several militants, and other standoffs across the city appeared to have ended by Friday. An Indian police officer takes position during an operation at the Chabad House Jewish center Friday. Officials said that at least 160 people have been killed in the violence and more than 300 injured. But even with most of the fighting quelled after more than two days of gun battles, many questions remain. The following is what is known about the attacks: . \u2022 Gunmen arrived by boats at the Mumbai waterfront near the Gateway of India monument on Wednesday night, police said. The gunmen hijacked cars, including a police van, and split into at least three groups to carry out the attacks, according to police.  Watch a timeline of the attacks \u00bb . \u2022 One group headed toward the Cafe Leopold, a popular hangout for Western tourists, firing indiscriminately at passers-by on the street. The group then opened fire and lobbed grenades at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, authorities said.  Watch theories on who attackers might be \u00bb . \u2022 As police rushed to the scene of the attacks, gunmen attacked the Cama Hospital for women and infants. Several people were killed at the hospital, and a standoff there lasted until Thursday morning.   \u2022 Two other groups attacked the Oberoi and Taj Mahal hotels, taking hostages there, police said. \u2022 Gunmen took hostages at the Chabad House, where several Jewish families live, police said. \u2022 Police said gunmen fired indiscriminately from the Chabad House. Stray bullets killed a couple in their home and a 16-year-old boy who stepped outside, police said. \u2022 The Chabad-Lubavitch International group said Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg, 29, made a phone call to the Israeli Consulate to report gunmen in the house. \"In the middle of the conversation, the line went dead,\" the organization said. \u2022 Authorities raided the Chabad house Friday morning. Two gunmen died after the assault was launched, CNN-IBN reported. Authorities said five hostages -- including Holtzberg, who was an American, and his Israeli wife, Rivka, 28 -- were found dead. One of the three others was a second American rabbi, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's office said. \u2022 At the hotels, hostages or people who were trapped exited at various times Thursday and Friday. Commandos entered both hotels, trying to flush out militants and rescue others. \u2022 Fire brigades battled blazes at both hotels. By early Friday, it appeared that what had been a major fire at the Oberoi had been extinguished. \u2022 Police were reporting Friday that the standoff at the Oberoi was over. Two gunmen were killed as authorities cleared the hotel, said J.K. Dutt, the National Security Guard's director-general. Thirty-six people were found dead there, according to Bhushan Gagrani, a Maharashtra state official. \u2022 At various times Saturday morning, gunfire and explosions could be heard as security forces worked to clear the Taj of at least one remaining gunman. \u2022 Shortly before 9 a.m. Saturday local time, Dutt said that three militants had been killed but that security personnel still needed to search the hotel for civilians and any possible remaining gunmen. His comments came shortly after Mumbai Police Chief Hussain Gafoor told CNN-IBN that the last militants at the Taj had been killed. The statements coincided with an apparent end of gunfire at the hotel. \u2022 By Friday night, 160 had been killed in the Mumbai attacks, including at least 15 foreign nationals, authorities said. These included five Americans, three Germans, an Italian, an Australian and one Chinese. \u2022 The official death toll did not include attackers who were killed by security forces. R.R. Patel, the Maharashtra home minister, said Friday that nine attackers had been killed. \u2022 More than 300 people were wounded, including seven Britons, three Americans and two Australians. \u2022 Two of the killed Americans were identified as Alan Scherr, 58, and his daughter Naomi, 13, both of Virginia. The two, who were visiting India with a meditation group, died at the Oberoi. \u2022 Also among the dead were 16 police officers, two commandos and the chief of the Mumbai police anti-terror squad.  \u2022 CNN-IBN quoted police sources as saying there were about 26 gunmen. \u2022 Authorities found 8 kilograms (17 pounds) of RDX, one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives, at a restaurant near the Taj.  \u2022 The Indian navy, stepping up patrols on the country's western coast after the attack, was questioning the crew of the MV Alpha, a ship detained with the help of the Indian coast guard, British authorities said. The authorities said that they think the attackers' boats came from this ship and that they think the ship is from Karachi, Pakistan. \u2022 Several Indian news outlets reported that a group called the Deccan Mujahideen e-mailed them to claim responsibility for the attacks. Intelligence officials say little is known about the group. U.S. officials and security analysts say the sophistication of the attacks may indicate that a more-established group is involved.  \u2022 State media Press Trust of India, citing Union Cabinet Minister Kapil Sibal, reported the gunmen had worked for months to prepare, even setting up \"control rooms\" in the two luxury hotels that were targeted.", "6dcdad019cbd6ab6674c35dd897d17d280a8468c": "NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- Two years after Hurricane Katrina devastated coastal areas of Louisiana and Mississippi, residents say much of America has forgotten their plight. President Bush and first lady Laura Bush pause for a moment of silence Wednesday at a New Orleans school. But President Bush said Wednesday the federal government has been persistent in pushing recovery efforts. \"I would like them to know that we still need all the help and caring and volunteers. We need it bad. People don't realize. They just don't realize,\" Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, resident Linda Fallon said. The beachfront communities of Bay St. Louis and Waveland, Mississippi, were nearly destroyed in Katrina's fury. Two years later, one-third of Bay St. Louis residents haven't returned. Business has moved inland.  Watch the struggle to rebuild in Mississippi \u00bb . \"Without the people, we don't have a town. We don't have a city, we don't have a place apart,\" Bay St. Louis Mayor Eddie Favre said Tuesday. He predicted it would be at least seven years before the town is back to near-normal. A longtime resident, Diane Bourgeois, has moved 15 miles inland to an apartment and said she doubts she will rebuild. Her home was razed. When she asked why, she said, \"I don't know, the memories. It will just never be the same. Can't risk it all again.\" David MacDonald, pastor of Calvary Independent Baptist Church in Bay St. Louis, said, \"We get crews coming down, but they are thinning out as the months go on. \"So it's trying to let the people know there is still a need down here, especially in the area of housing. And just the mental and spiritual needs that are down here -- just still overwhelming.\" In New Orleans, Bush participated in a moment of silence at the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Charter School for Science and Technology to remember Katrina victims. He said that the U.S. government hasn't forgotten the Gulf Coast and that federal efforts to make post-Katrina improvements to levees and infrastructure were unyielding. \"I hope people understand we're still paying attention. We understand,\" Bush said. Eighty percent of the the $114 billion allocated to the region for Hurricane Katrina repairs has been disbursed, he said. \"We're still engaged,\" Bush said of federal agencies. The president, in his 15th visit to the region since Katrina hit, called the school \"a place of hope.\" Bush said Katrina broke hearts but not \"the spirit\" of New Orleans citizens. But he alluded to the challenges faced across the region, citing teachers who commuted 30 miles to teach at the school. \"This town is better today than it was yesterday,\" Bush said in praising the Gulf Coast rebuilding effort. But he said it would be even better tomorrow. He urged people across the country to pitch in to help the recovery, whether through donations or volunteer efforts or even moving to the area and joining its work force. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin said his city's population increase -- citing 4,000 to 7,000 people a month -- is a good indication of the progress made since Katrina hit. On Wednesday, Nagin participated in the groundbreaking for a memorial to storm victims. \"We ring the bells for a city that is in recovery; we ring the bells for hope that the promise that was made at Jackson Square will become a reality and will restore confidence in government at all levels,\" Nagin said, referring to the scene of Bush's vow in 2005 that the government would help the city and region recover. Katrina first made landfall on August 25 in South Florida as a Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds of near 81 mph. At one point, after moving west into the Gulf of Mexico, it reached Category 5 status, with maximum sustained winds of nearly 173 mph before making landfall on the Gulf Coast. Four days after its initial landfall, Katrina came ashore near Buras, Louisiana, as a Category 3 storm, with winds near 127 mph. Initial reports put the wind speed higher, but the National Weather Service later revised its statistics. Water breached two levees in New Orleans at the 17th Street and Industrial Canals, flooding 80 percent of the historic city. More than 1,800 people died in five states -- 1,577 of them in Louisiana. Days after the storm, images of people stranded across the region -- particularly in New Orleans where horror stories emerged from the Louisiana Superdome -- led to outcries of an inadequate response from the government. After supporting him in the days after the hurricane, Bush announced that Michael Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, would resign September 12. A special House of Representatives committee released a report in February 2006, saying the \"response of government at all levels to Hurricane Katrina was \"dismal,\" poorly planned and badly coordinated, showing that more than four years after the 9/11 attacks, \"America is still not ready for prime time.\" E-mail to a friend .

One I-Reporter acknowledges, \"I never was a political supporter of Benazir Bhutto but now after her death I feel that her loss is a loss for Pakistan, not just her political supporters.\" Anthony G. Moore photographed Benazir Bhutto with her husband Asif Ali Zardari in New York in 2006. Benazir Bhutto was assassinated during a suicide bombing on December 27, 2007, and I-Reporters from all over the world responded with their memories and condolences. Below are selections, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Farhad Sethi of Lahore, Pakistan  Breathing in the air of grief and sadness, the nation suffers the loss of our beloved leader Benazir Bhutto, an institution in herself withstanding pressures at times when suicide bombing has become an unstoppable enigma. A sniper pierced a bullet through her neck and our enthusiastic leader couldn't even make it to the hospital, her last words God knows what were they but her face and inspirational personality will always be remembered. A woman who grew up with politics in her backyard is no longer with us, she was a graduate from Harvard and Oxford universities and seeing her go down in a wooden casket was a sight bringing down tears in every eye. We all have to go down the ground one day but being assassinated like this is not something we would want for even our worst enemies. She has left a space that will never be filled in the hearts and minds of the nation. She has enjoyed the position of being the first Muslim woman to lead a country as Prime Minister, but this is over she's gone, may Allah (swt) have mercy on her soul and she rests in peace in a better place. Ameen. Al Alston of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Benazir Bhutto's gifts to Pakistan and the world far outweigh the charges made by her adversaries. I will never forget how she led Pakistan in its unwavering support for the African National Congress during the misery of the apartheid days. Her presence at the inauguration of Nelson Mandela left an indelible impression on me. I remain an admirer of her nation because of this critical alliance. I will keep her family and nation in my prayers. Mickin Sahni of Stone Ridge, Virginia  As a first generation Indian-American, I have heard from my parents the turmoil on the subcontinent as their parents were forced to India while their friends were forced to Pakistan. Bhutto's effort to reconcile the differences between the two countries was one of her main missions. Indians throughout the world remember her as a peaceful link between the two nuclear superpowers and could only sympathize with Pakistanis grieving throughout the world. Hopefully her efforts were not in vain. Sandra Rios of Aberdeen, Maryland  Benazir Bhutto loved her country and people so much that despite an assassination attempt in Oct and continuous death threats she remained unshaken. As a Women and a Former US soldier I admire her bravery. Russ Bonny of Golden, Colorado  I haven't had the raw emotions I am feeling right now since September 11, 2001. The death of Mrs. Bhutto is a loss for the entire world and a grim reminder of how tirelessly we must fight extremists. Whitney Anderson of Irving, Texas  I never really got the chance to know much about this woman. I'm still a teen, trying to figure out this mess we call our own democracy. But I can say this. For anyone to be slaughtered is a shame. It's crazy to think young adults like myself have had to grow up in a time where planes are flown into buildings, wars are dragging on and dragging us down, and now a revered and respected woman is dead, only because she was trying to better the world. I can only hope my future children don't have to live like this, and that the only time they hear of things like this is in a history book. Shima of Tehran, Iran  All Persians know what her name means... Her name means Unique, and she was unique in all her life. God bless her. Naureen Haider of Jensen Beach, Florida  It's a great loss to the country. Ms. Bhutto went to the same elementary school as mine, Convent of Jesus and Mary School in Karachi, and she was always an example to us, to motivate, thus that it is proud to be a female. Benazir, not only earned the best of qualifications on merit, but also proved to the world, that this is what patriotism is. My family having met Benazir personally several times, sends our deepest condolences to the family and prayers go out to the children. May Allah be with them. Ameen!! Humnaa Umar of Great Falls, Virginia  The death of Benazir Bhutto not only marked the end of a revolutionary political leader, but also the demise of a pioneer in terms of women's rights. In a country with a strict gender hierarchy, Bhutto inspired countless women with her ceaseless supply of fortitude.  Mwilu Mwanachilenga of Lusaka, Zambia  A Martyr. A pity though that a life that I looked up to, for the whole 25 years of my existence, could ever end like this. Condolences to the family and may her soul rest in peace . Sabina Brauner of Frankfurt, Germany  Disbelief was my first reaction when I just read the news. And shock. At such violence. I do not remember her as an outstanding figure but when someone mentioned Pakistan there was that immediate connection: Pakistan-Bhutto. So after such an act you just hope against hope that people there will find peace. I wish them all the best. Ahsan Khan of Reading, United Kingdom  I never was a political supporter of Benazir Bhutto but now after her death I feel that her loss is a loss for Pakistan and not just for her political followers. The present government setup has failed and should resign to stop further bloodshed. God bless Benazir Bhutto's soul. Erum Qayyum of Lahore, Pakistan  As the first female prime minister in the Muslim world, I felt as if women are really going to get ahead and men would actually start taking their technical knowledge more seriously but of course men are men. Her death was appalling and the way it happened. It has shocked me and everyone else in my family even though we are not really Benazir's supporters. It is a wonder that my land of Pakistan is actually going to the dogs where no one is safe. I wish the Bush administration opens its eyes to what's happening because neither the civilian nor the military governments have done anything to make this land of mine more peaceful and secure to live in. Moses Quinion Galabuzi of Kampala, Uganda  It is too sad to hear of the assassination of this great lady. I was following her very closely and had a lot of respect for her. Whoever did kill her will die the same way but will never be a hero just as she was. Rest in peace Honorable Benazir Bhutto. May the good Lord reward you for the great things you did. Carlo Zappa of Montreal, Quebec  When will the horror in Pakistan end? My heart goes out to her family and to the people of Pakistan. Her life was cut short and mankind will never see the additional good she could have done to resolve the endless political conflict in India. Ahmed Alian of Cairo, Egypt  She was a brave woman in a coward world, may her soul rest in peace. I'm not blaming Musharraf for killing her, but I'm blaming him for feeding the atmosphere of terrorism through his dictatorship, which is unfortunately, supported by the so-called \"free world.\" Oyefeso Temitope of Lagos, Nigeria  You had a heart to help save Pakistan from military dictatorship, and you have to pay with your life!!! What a world!!! We await the reaction of the West. Sleep well, it was a just curse and rare fight from a woman. Linda Palumbo of Boston, Massachusetts  A woman who was beautiful, brilliant and dedicated to bringing peace to her country. Such a tragedy and such a loss for the people of Pakistan. Kartiq Subramanian of Charlotte, North Carolina  This is really sad! My limited political knowledge told me that she was Pakistan's only hope toward democracy and peace and now her killing has proved that. I feel sad for her family and for the people of Pakistan. May peace prevail. Fariha Waseem of Spring Valley, New York  Benazir Bhutto is a woman of courage and conviction and we Pakistani's are proud to acknowledge her with all the dedication and deeds she made for her country. She stands for principal of democracy and corruptions and wants to remove it from roots. She not only received awards for her books but for her all dedications she did for her peoples. My condolence is with all the loved ones of Bhutto's family and her party workers. May God rest her soul in Peace! (Amen) Funmi Omoniyi of Lagos, Nigeria  We will miss you Benazir Bhutto because you are a strong woman, ready to fight for your country. As a woman of substance, you deserve to rest in perfect peace. May Allah grant you Aljanat Amiin. Kimberley Brewer of Ottawa, Ontario  Although I have no ties, either familial or political, to Benazir Bhutto, I am deeply saddened and enraged by her murder. This noble leader, who championed women's rights in a society rife with discrimination toward fully half the population, has been felled by cowards who seek to thwart progress and peace. My heart goes out to all who mourn her loss as I do, and my condemnation to those responsible for this horrific act of barbarism. Mohammad Khurram Khan of Cleveland, Ohio  It is a sad day for all Pakistanis and the entire world. This is a direct result of the aftermath of September 11 and its ongoing consequences around the world. The blazes set forth by the terrorist continue to burn today in different cities. Bhutto was a legend and a role model for all men and women alike. She was inspirational not just to Pakistanis, but inspirational to us all through out the world. It is saddening (with tears in my eyes and sorrow in my heart) to see such a [legend] become a part of the blaze beset by the terrorists. Terrorists have no religion or political affiliations. They only have motives driven by greed and power. I certainly hope that the terrorist behind this are brought to justice and I am sure that General Musharraf will do his best to do so as he has always done in the interest of Pakistan.

Nick Schuyler clings to an overturned boat in this Coast Guard photo. \"We now know we are looking for persons in the water, not a boat,\" said Coast Guard Capt. Tim Close. Nick Schuyler, a former University of South Florida football player, was the only person still with the small fishing boat when a Coast Guard cutter came across it about 50 miles west of Clearwater Beach on Monday, the Coast Guard said. Still missing Monday afternoon were Oakland Raiders linebacker Marquis Cooper; NFL free agent Corey Smith, who played for the Detroit Lions for the past three seasons; and former University of South Florida football player William Bleakley. Schuyler told his rescuers that the boat was anchored Saturday evening when it was overturned by waves during a storm, Close said. He told them that all four men were clinging to the boat for a time, but became separated, Close said. The four men embarked in a 21-foot single-engine boat from the Seminole Boat Ramp near Clearwater Pass about 6:30 a.m. Saturday, the Coast Guard said. The search was launched early Sunday after friends and relatives realized they had not returned from their fishing trip. Schuyler appeared to be conscious and talking in video showing him being removed from a Coast Guard helicopter Monday afternoon.  Watch Schuyler being moved on stretcher \u00bb . Although he was initially able to answer a few questions to help with the search for the three missing men, officials decided to wait until he was treated for hypothermia before talking with him again, Coast Guard Petty Officer Robert Simpson said.  See photos of rescue \u00bb . Schuyler's parents, Marcia and Stu Schuyler, told reporters in Florida on Monday they were ecstatic that their son had been found alive. But Stu Schuyler said his \"heart is still out\" for the three missing men. \"We're not going to talk too much until we find these guys. We're all praying for them,\" Stu Schuyler said. The Air Force Reserve sent a C-130 airplane and a Pave Hawk helicopter to assist the Coast Guard's search, which also included several other helicopters and airplanes. Three Coast Guard cutters were also on the water, Close said. Rough seas and high winds that hampered the search Sunday continued Monday. The Coast Guard reported winds of 15 to 20 knots and waves up to 9 feet in the search area Monday. \"It feels like my greatest fear coming true -- it doesn't feel real,\" Cooper's wife, Rebekah, told CNN affiliate WTSP-TV in Tampa on Sunday. \"I'm just waiting for a phone call.\"  Watch relatives, friends express concern for missing boaters \u00bb . Cooper said she became worried Saturday night when she didn't hear from her husband. She called her husband's fishing buddy, Brian Miller, who contacted the Coast Guard with the coordinates of where the men planned to fish. \"Usually I'm on the boat. It's a little difficult wondering if something would have been different if I had been there,\" Miller said. He said it was clear something was wrong when Cooper didn't call Saturday night. \"He should've been within range to use his cell phone, and he knows enough to shut it off when he goes out so the batteries are still there,\" he said. Rebekah Cooper said her husband was aware of Sunday's weather forecast and for that reason picked Saturday for the trip. \"Fishing is his first love, it always has been,\" she said, adding, \"I have a lot of faith in him out there.\" Cooper's father said he learned of the situation Sunday morning from Rebekah. His son \"routinely stays out on the water 12 to 14 hours,\" Bruce Cooper, a sports anchor for CNN affiliate KPNX-TV in Phoenix, Arizona, said in a statement. He called his son an \"avid fisherman.\" \"He goes deep-sea fishing any opportunity he gets,\" Cooper said in the statement. \"Two years ago, I went deep-sea fishing with him. I swore I would never do so again; I didn't like the fact that I couldn't see land. Needless to say, I am very concerned.

Smith, who entered the league with Tampa Bay in 2002, went on to play for the Washington Redskins before moving to the Lions for the 2006 season.

Anne Hathaway accessorized her Armani Prive gown with more than $1 million worth of Cartier jewelry. Since then, the red carpet has been a can't-miss staple of the evening, and Hollywood's hottest stars work with fashion designers, wardrobe stylists, jewelers, hairstylists and makeup artists to create looks they hope will go down in fashion history. This year's show was no exception, and high-wattage stars such as Anne Hathaway, Kate Winslet and Natalie Portman walked the red carpet in stunning couture gowns. Here are just a few of our favorites: . \u2022 Best actress nominee Anne Hathaway made the most of her big night, arriving in a champagne-colored strapless Armani Prive gown that glittered with paillettes and Swarovski crystals. When the \"Rachel Getting Married\" star turned to give an over-the-shoulder pose, she revealed an unexpected onyx and black crystal dragon brooch, which was affixed to the back of her gown. Diamonds are always in fashion on the red carpet, and the actress accessorized with more than $1 million worth from jeweler Cartier. \u2022 Best actress nominee Kate Winslet looked as stunning as ever in an asymmetrical Atelier Yves Saint Laurent gown and Chopard jewels. Despite her picture-perfect appearance, the Oscar winner for \"The Reader\" admitted, \"I'm extremely nervous!\"  See photos of InStyle's favorite red carpet looks \u00bb . \u2022 \"Slumdog Millionaire\" beauty Freida Pinto continued her winning awards season style streak in a John Galliano royal-blue gown made of silk tulle with delicate embroidery and metallic beading. The 24-year-old, who said an enthusiastic hello to her parents in India from the red carpet, wore Martin Katz jewelry, including a ring set with a 150-year-old diamond from her native country. \u2022 In a sea of red and white dresses Natalie Portman stood out in an orchid gown by Rodarte, vegan heels by Stella McCartney and a vintage Rialto clutch. The actress' minimal Kwiat jewelry and elegant updo highlighted her flawless skin. Portman was truly an Oscars triple threat, making our best dressed, best hair and best makeup lists. Other colorful bests included Sarah Jessica Parker's Dior Haute Couture gown, which we loved not only for the shade (which she described as \"barely mint, maybe seafoam\") but also for its impressive size. Best supporting actress nominee Amy Adams was stunning in a crimson silk and satin gown by Carolina Herrera and a jaw-dropping, jeweled collar necklace by Fred Leighton (as seen on Beyonc\u00e9 in the November 2008 issue of InStyle!). And Heidi Klum's bright red dress was not only glamorous, but also charitable: For the second year running, the \"Project Runway\" host partnered with The Heart Truth campaign to raise awareness of women's heart health by wearing red. Last year, Klum wore a custom red dress by John Galliano for Dior that was auctioned off for charity, and this year she hit the carpet in a red silk taffeta gown from RM by Roland Mouret. The stylish supermodel accessorized with a diamond and ruby bracelet charm of her own design that will be part of a giveaway on dietcoke.com.

Loved ones of one of the missing boaters react Tuesday to the news the Coast Guard's search would end. \"There's a lot of things we have to come to grips with -- we've all agreed unanimously we won't give up hope,\" said Bruce Cooper, father of Oakland Raiders linebacker Marquis Cooper. Cooper, NFL free agent Corey Smith and former college football player William Bleakley are missing, with authorities believing a fishing boat carrying them and a fourth man overturned Saturday in the Gulf of Mexico. The Coast Guard search was called off at sundown Tuesday, about 6:30 p.m. The fourth man, Nick Schuyler, was found alive and sitting atop the overturned boat about 40 miles west of Egmont Key, Florida, on Monday afternoon. Cooper's father and his friend, Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Terry \"Tank\" Johnson, praised the Coast Guard for its efforts, but said they would move forward with plans to organize their own search. \"What we're asking for is experienced aviation pilots\" to volunteer for the mission, Johnson said. \"We are looking only for experienced pilots ... we don't want another tragedy as we are searching.\" Johnson said he had spoken to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, and that \"we have the support of the entire NFL\" in continuing the search. Neither the league nor Goodell commented on the missing players Tuesday, but Cooper's team, the Oakland Raiders, issued a statement saying the team continues to \"closely monitor\" the situation. \"We are aware that one of the passengers -- Nick Schuyler -- has been rescued and remain hopeful that the others ... will be located and rescued as well,\" it said.  See photos of Schuyler's rescue \u00bb . The team for which Smith most recently played, the Detroit Lions, said: \"While we still have that hope, we have begun to cope with the grim reality of this sad and tragic situation.\" Earlier Tuesday, Coast Guard Capt. Timothy Close announced the search would conclude in the evening, saying authorities were \"extremely confident that if there were any [other] survivors on the surface of the water ... we would have found them.\"  Watch the Coast Guard say it will call off the search \u00bb . Bruce Cooper said that when his family received the news that the Coast Guard search was ending, \"It got very emotional.\" He said his son's wife, Rebekah, was trying to rest. \"She is likewise very emotional. She's got a lot of things going through her head, her 3-year-old daughter, for one,\" he said. He also said despite his son's career as a pro football player, his first love was deep-sea fishing. \"He definitely got lost in his element,\" Cooper said. The four friends embarked on a fishing trip in a 21-foot single-engine boat from the Seminole Boat Ramp near Clearwater Pass about 6:30 a.m. Saturday, the Coast Guard said. Authorities launched a search for them early Sunday after friends and relatives realized the men had not returned. Close said authorities believe the boat capsized around 5 p.m. Saturday as the men were trying to lift the boat's anchor. The men were \"not wearing life jackets at the time the boat capsized,\" he said earlier, but \"immediately swam under the boat, recovered life jackets and managed to put them on.\" The weather was calm when the trip began, but it worsened late Saturday into Sunday, Close said. He said he believed they were aware of the forecast. Searchers scanned about 24,000 square miles of ocean in about 60 hours, Close said. Authorities found a life jacket and a cooler about 16 miles from where Schuyler and the boat were found Monday, Close said. Schuyler is suffering from dehydration and hypothermia, making it difficult for him to speak, said his father, Stuart Schuyler.  Watch Nick Schuyler's father overjoyed that his son is safe \u00bb . Schuyler, who, like Bleakley, used to be a University of South Florida football player, was able to speak to Coast Guard authorities for a short time, Close said.  Watch Schuyler being moved on a stretcher \u00bb . Schuyler told rescuers that all four men clung to the boat for a time, but then became separated, Close said. Schuyler last saw his three friends at 2 a.m. Monday, his father told CNN affiliate WTSP-TV on Monday. Schuyler's mother, Marcia Schuyler, told the Tampa, Florida, television station that thoughts of his family helped to keep him alive. \"He told me: 'Mom, I kept saying you're not going to go to my funeral.' He said that's what kept him hanging on,\" she said. Close said he understood there were some plans for amateur searches, and he urged caution. \"We don't want any new search-and-rescue cases resulting from good Samaritan efforts,\" Close said. He said Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission will investigate, in line with state law, and they may attempt to recover the boat sometime Wednesday.

Proposed legislation regulating in-vitro practices came after Nadya Suleman gave birth to octuplets. A Georgia state senator introduced legislation to limit the number of embryos that can be implanted in a woman's uterus during in-vitro fertilization procedures. Sen. Ralph Hudgens, a Republican from near Athens, Georgia, said his legislation was inspired by Nadya Suleman, the woman who said she gave birth to octuplets after being fertilized with six embryos -- an unusually high number. \"She is not married,\" said Hudgens. \"She is unemployed, she is on government assistance and now she is going to put those 14 children on the back of the taxpayers in the state of California.\" Suleman, 33, had six children before the procedure. Hudgens' plan, which was co-sponsored by several other senators, would limit the number of embryos a doctor could implant to two for women under 40 years old and three for women 40 or older. Those numbers are slightly less than what's considered the norm in medical circles. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommends no more than two embryos for women under 35 years old and no more than five for women over 40. The reason for allowing more embryos in women over 40 is that it is more difficult for them to get pregnant. State lawmakers in Missouri are considering a similar bill. And England and Italy have had similar limits on the books for years. At least some fertility doctors say the limits in Hudgens' bill would hurt chances for women to get pregnant. They say that while three embryos are usually enough, there are special cases when they need more. \"What this bill will effectively do is shut us down,\" said Dr. Daniel Shapiro, a fertility doctor in Atlanta. \"Patients seeking reproductive care in Georgia will go to Tennessee or South Carolina or Alabama. They will just leave.\" Breaking the law would carry a fine of up to $1,000 under the legislation. Some critics of the plan also see another problem, calling it a backdoor effort to outlaw abortions in the state. The bill, which Hudgens titled the \"Ethical Treatment of Human Embryos Act,\" contains language that says \"a living in vitro human embryo is a biological human being who is not the property of any person or entity.\" The anti-abortion group Georgia Right to Life issued a news release in support of the bill on the day it was introduced. \"Georgia Right to Life supports Sen. Hudgens in this legislation and wants to see strong protections in place to stop the dangerous practice of implanting more embryos than is medically recommended,\" the group said, saying the plan would help avoid premature births and low birth weight in in-vitro fertilization cases. Realistically, the bill faces long odds of passing -- at least in the near future. Tuesday was Day 25 of the Georgia legislature's 40-day session. Legislators will meet 10 more days, then take a break until June, when lawmakers will consider how money flowing to the state from the federal economic-stimulus plan may help their ongoing budget woes. According the the Georgia legislature's Web site on Tuesday, Hudgens' bill had been read and assigned to a committee, but no other action had taken place. Some Georgians from the lawmaker's part of the state say they hope he has to keep waiting for a long time. \"Unless the senator is a physician, ethicist or other informed professional, he should step aside and let the medical professionals determine what is best in individual cases,\" Dorothy West wrote in a letter to the editor of the Athens Banner-Herald, Hudgens' hometown paper. \"There are other issues more important to the citizens of Georgia that should be addressed.\" CNN's Elizabeth Cohen and Doug Gross contributed to this report.", "97b50bfe94dd4d7a6dbf82241be134744ead3bea": "(LifeWire) -- Jennifer Bilotta thought she and her husband Michael had the perfect present for his cousin's wedding. The gift in question -- a fused-glass plate decorated with a \"tacky scene of a bride and groom,\" she recalls -- had been given to Bilotta at her own wedding a few years earlier. Nothing wrong with a little regifting as long as the bride and groom enjoy the gift. Or so Bilotta thought. \"She collects Barbies, and he collects G.I. Joes,\" says Bilotta, 33, a publicist in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. \"The plate seemed up their alley. So for their wedding gift, we gave them the plate along with a card with a check for the usual wedding amount.\" But the gift didn't go over well. \"A few weeks after they got married, we were talking to them about their wedding gifts, and they mentioned this hideous glass plate that someone gave them,\" Bilotta says. \"The card must have gotten separated from the plate, so they didn't know it was from us and they both went on about how ugly it was. We never fessed up.\"  Watch when to send a gift \u00bb . Deciding what to give (or not give) newlyweds is never an easy task, says Peggy Post, one of the country's leading etiquette experts and co-author of the book \"A Wedding Like No Other.\" Before you turn into a guestzilla, however, take heart. \"Gift giving doesn't have to be a stressful experience,\" says Post. The wrong way to give . Some gifts should never be given -- namely those that you yourself received. Whether it's to save yourself some cash or to avoid the hassle of shopping, regifting is a wedding no-no, says Steve Kemble, star of Style Network's \"Whose Wedding Is It Anyway?\" and \"Married Away.\" \"What makes you think someone is going to want a gift you did not want?\" Kemble says. \"Plain and simple, re-gifting is tacky! If you do not have the time to think about what a couple would really want, then don't give anything at all.\" Kemble ticks off a few of his favorite wedding gift gaffes: shot glasses (\"I simply do not think there could be anything tackier,\" he says); knives ( \"they represent bad luck for a relationship\"); and, worst of all, deciding that a gift isn't necessary, because you gave the bride or groom a gift the last time they got married. \"If you feel this way, then I feel you should not attend the wedding,\" he says. \"If you are going to sincerely celebrate with them on their special day, then show that you are happy for them, and tradition says you should do this by honoring them with a gift.\" The right way to give . When it comes to gift giving, Rob Johnsen, co-founder of MyWedding.com, has some simple, if calculating advice: Decide how much your relationship is worth. If the happy couple are two of your most cherished friends or relatives, get ready to fork over about $200, says Johnsen. \"A blender or silverware off a traditional registry won't quite have the sentiment you are looking for,\" he says. Is the bride or groom is someone you talk to only a few times a year, yet someone you still value? Then keep your gift between $50 and $100, and feel comfortable selecting a set of dishes off the registry, says Johnsen. For distant relations, friends of friends or other lesser acquaintances, limit your spending to $50. \"Sentiment here really isn't of concern, so go for something off the registry, or some cash in a card is acceptable too,\" Johnsen says. Peggy Post disagrees with putting a price limit on a wedding gift (\"There's no such thing as a dollar amount,\" she says), but she does suggest basing the amount you spend on your affection for the bride and groom and their family. \"If you're a close cousin, you'd probably want to ratchet it up a bit, rather than if you're just an acquaintance,\" she says. Of course, not everyone can afford to give extravagantly, even if the newlyweds are dear friends. Not to fear, Post says: You won't be breaking any etiquette rules by splitting the cost of a high-dollar gift with a fellow guest. And, she adds, it's especially acceptable if you're in your 20s and a recent college graduate with a limited income. Cash is acceptable, too, as is deviating from the bridal registry. \"Do what you feel comfortable with,\" Post says. \"Just don't do something totally off the wall.\" Gifts that make memories . Sometimes, though, offbeat wedding gifts can impress. Manhattan resident Samuella Becker, 53, says she'll never forget a gift someone gave her and her husband for their wedding 24 years ago. \"One of the members of our wedding party, an attorney who I worked with at a major Fortune 500 company, gave us a magician to perform at our reception,\" explains the owner of a media relations firm. There was just one problem: The reception, held in the elegant Crystal Room at New York City's Tavern on the Green, wasn't exactly the ideal place for magic tricks. But, Becker says, the gift, which might have been seen as tacky by some, ended up becoming a wedding-day highlight. \"All guests, young and old, were absolutely entranced and filled with wonder as the magician performed trick after trick,\" she says. It was a reminder, she says, that sometimes the most unusual and daring gifts can be the most memorable and welcome. LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.

Capsized: This French catamaran flipped near New Zealand while attempting to win the Jules Verne Trophy. This danger is never more evident than in the epic Volvo Ocean Race. The round-the-world event which begins this month in Alicante, Spain, always throws up its fair share of drama as the crews face all types of conditions right through to the race finish around July 2009. To give an idea of the extreme dangers this year's crews will face over the coming nine months, here is a look at some of the worst tragedies to strike yacht racing. There's no question about it: this is no sport for the faint-hearted. September 2008 R\u00e9gates Royales-Troph\u00e9e Panerai Death toll: One . Wilfrid Tolhurst was killed during the famous R\u00e9gates Royales-Troph\u00e9e Panerai yacht race off Cannes that sees the major classic yachts in the Mediterranean gather. Skippering the eight-meter yacht, Safir, in the coastal race, Tolhurst was struck by the boat's falling mast that broke off under the impact of a collision with another boat, Rowdy. Although rescue crews reacted quickly to bring the skipper ashore, nothing could be done to save his life. A police inquiry is currently in progress to determine the cause of the incident. September 2008 Sean Whiston Perpetual Cup Race Death toll: One . Kenneth Jones (46) lost his life while sailing in a race from Wicklow to the Poolbeg Yacht Club in Dublin, Ireland. It was not clear what caused the incident, however, a mayday was issued by the yacht Allanah, stating that there was 'a man in the water.' Jones was lifted from the water and transferred to Tallaght Hospital where he later died. May 2006 Volvo Ocean Race Death toll: One . During the seventh leg of the race Hans Horrevoets, 32, of The Netherlands was swept overboard from ABN Amro Two in heavy seas. Although he was recovered from the water, attempts to resuscitate him were not successful. The savage storm that hit the fleet could easily have claimed more lives. The crew of Movistar abandoned ship after the aft end of their keel pivot broke away from their hull in the night -- less than 48 hours after Horrevoets died. The crew transferred to ABN Amro Two which had been standing by and was escorted by HMS Mersey back to land. December 1998 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: Six . One of the saddest events in yachting history began at Sydney Harbor on December 26, 1998, when the annual Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race set off. Fierce storms and violent winds battered the 115-strong fleet in the famously tough event off the eastern coast of Australia and only 44 boats made it to the finish line at Hobart. Met by the massive storms, five boats sank, 66 boats retired from the race, six sailors died, and 55 sailors were taken off their yachts, most by helicopter. Among those who died were; Mike Bannister (Winston Churchill), Glyn Charles (Sword of Orion), John Dean (Winston Churchill), Bruce Guy (Business Post Naiad), Jim Lawler (Winston Churchill), Phillip Skeggs (Business Post Naiad). The vessels; Winston Churchill, VC Offshore Stand Aside, Sword of Orion, Miintinta, and Midnight Special all sank. 1989 Whitbread Round the World Race Death toll: One . Competing boat Creighton's Naturally suffered a serious broach in the early hours of one morning during the second leg of the race, at about three in the morning. Crew members Anthony (Tony) Philips and Bart van den Dwey were swept over board. Both were pulled back on deck and although Van den Dwey was successfully resuscitated, after three hours of trying, crew members could not revive Philips. Several days later, by radio agreement with his relatives, Philips was buried at sea. December 1989 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: One . Peter Taylor, crew member aboard BP Flying Colours suffered fatal head injuries when a runner on his vessel broke and the rig collapsed in gale-force south westerly winds. December 1988 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: One . In another grueling race 38 of the 119 starters retired, nearly half of them with broken masts or damaged rigging. Ray Crawford aboard Billabong was killed. December 1984 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: One . Wally Russell of Yahoo II died during the 1984 edition of the race, which was hit by a low pressure system that created two different swell patterns. August 1979 Fastnet Yacht Race Death toll: Fifteen . Huge storms in the Irish Sea wreaked havoc on more than 300 yachts taking part in the biennial race, resulting in 15 deaths and one of the worst yacht race disasters of all time. The race was well regarded after being established in 1925, and in 1979 was the climax of the five-race Admiral's Cup competition. As the storms battered the fleet, naval ships, lifeboats, commercial boats, and helicopters from the west side of the English Channel were brought to aid what was the largest peace-time rescue operation. The rescue effort saw 125 sailors, whose boats had been caught in force 11 storm strength wind gusts, taken to safety, while 15 people could not be saved. In total 69 yachts did not finish the race. December 1975 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: One . Zilvergeest III's Hugh (Barry) Vallance was killed during the 1975 event, despite reasonably good sailing conditions. September 1973 Whitbread Round the World Race Death toll: Three . The first race started off from Portsmouth, England on September 8, 1973. Seventeen yachts of various sizes and shapes took part. During the race three sailors were swept over board and died: Paul Waterhouse, Dominique Guillet and Bernie Hosking. Waterhouse and Guillet were never to be seen again.", "802531133b69a9164d3c57c8d10eb535de6fde7f": "MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- Inside the blacked-out Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, hallways were littered with bloodied bodies. A commando in disguise give details of what went down in the Taj hotel when commandos went in. Terrorists were still holding 200 people 33 hours after the assault began. Knowing next to nothing about what they might encounter in the dark recesses of the hotel, Indian Army commandos decided to go back in -- and were met by terrorists firing mercilessly, throwing  grenades and continuously switching positions. The sound of gunfire and explosions reverberated throughout the hotel's atrium, making it impossible to pinpoint the origin of the shots. Through it all, the commandos walked down pitch-black halls, trying to navigate the damaged hotel without knowing the layout. A commando spokesman, his face and hair swathed in a black scarf and wearing dark glasses to hide his identity, revealed these details of the mission inside the Taj at a news conference Friday. At 6:30 a.m. Friday, the battle at the Taj came to a head with a final firefight at the room holding the 200 hostages, he said.  Watch what it was like inside the hotel for commandos \u00bb . When the gunfire stopped, commandos -- known as the Black Cats -- entered the room and freed all 200 hostages. Their difficulties had been apparent from the beginning, he said. \"We did not know the layout of the hotel,\" the commando told reporters. \"There was one person on the hotel staff who was helping to guide us around.\" They entered the hotel for the first time essentially blind to what was ahead. They had no idea what kind of people they would encounter, what kind of weapons might be pointed at them, and whether they might be blown up by explosives.  Learn more about the Taj's past and future \u00bb . \"Then we heard gunshots on the second floor and we rushed toward the fired shots,\" he said. \"While taking cover we found that there were 30 to 50 bodies lying dead. At that point we also came under fire. The moment they saw us, they hurled grenades.\" When the shots stopped, the commandos moved toward the source of the gunfire.  See the first photos from inside the Taj Mahal hotel \u00bb . \"At that time, they vanished ... they had gone elsewhere,\" the commando said. The attackers had a clear advantage, commandos said, because it was apparent from their movements they knew the hotel's layout. Some tourists rescued from the hotel said the building's large dome and a massive atrium made the sounds of gunfire and explosions reverberate endlessly. It was impossible to pinpoint where the shooters were. Because of the darkness, commandos could not tell how many terrorists were there -- were there many, or only a few who continued to change positions? At one point, commandos believed some of the terrorists were hiding on the eighth floor. As the commandos approached one of the rooms, attackers opened fire at them and said all the people in the room were dead. \"We fired at them and they fired at us, but because the room was absolutely dark and we had just gotten [inside] it made it difficult for us,\" the commando said.  Watch commandos talk about fighting the attackers \u00bb . During the fight, two commandos were shot. They decided to flush out the terrorists by blocking entry and exit routes. But the attackers knew all the doors, he said. When they made it inside the room, the terrorists had disappeared again. Inside that room, commandos found AK-47 ammunition rounds, including seven magazines fully loaded, and 400 other rounds for other weapons. They found grenades, credit cards, U.S. notes, foreign money and bags of dried fruit, which they believed helped sustain the attackers during the siege. During the three-day assault, the attackers fired indiscriminately. But the commandos were forced to use caution. \"Let me tell you one thing,\" the commando said. \"Within the first exchanges of fire, we could have got those terrorists -- but there was so many hotel guests -- there were bodies all over and blood all over. And we were trying to avoid the causalities of civilians. We had to be more careful in our fighting.\" In trying to rescue hostages and trapped civilians, commandos had to convince guests they were there to help, not terrorists trying to trick them, Indian Army Lt. Gen. Noble Thamburaj said. \"There are a number of rooms that are locked from inside,\" he told reporters.  \"It is possible that some of the hotel guests have locked themselves in and for their own security and safety. Even though we have identified ourselves they are not opening the doors.\" The overall operation may have been made more difficult because of a late start, CNN sister station CNN-IBN reported. CNN-IBN said that attacks at the Taj Mahal Hotel were well under way at 9:30 p.m. Wednesday, but unnamed sources said the commandos were not given the go-ahead to take part in the rescue until midnight. Those sources told CNN-IBN said that once the commandos got the go-ahead, it took nearly three hours for them to leave for Mumbai from their undisclosed location. Once they arrived, the sources said, commandos had no precise maps of the hotel layout or its access points. While local police and other officers were at the scene, the sources said, the commandos and army special force units are the only ones equipped and trained to rescue hostages.", "c1ea35d3ed306ef8cb511a07bf18a2c7cc7ea944": "(CNN) -- Piracy off the coast of Somalia rose nearly 200 percent in 2008 compared to the year before, with bolder attacks over greater distances, an international piracy monitor said Friday. The French military on patrol in the Gulf of Aden. Somalia and the Gulf of Aden were the worst areas for piracy in 2008, according to the annual report from International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Center (PRC). It said 42 vessels were hijacked there and 815 crew members taken hostage -- more than any place else in the world. The increased ability of pirates to sail farther out to sea, coupled with the inability of the Somali government to respond, led to what the report called an \"unprecedented\" rise in piracy in the area. The problems off the Somali coast contributed to a global rise in piracy, which was up 11 percent in 2008 from the year before, the report said. \"The 2008 statistics surpass all figures recorded by the PRC since it began its worldwide reporting function in 1991,\" said IMB Director Captain Pottengal Mukundan. Worldwide in 2008, a total of 49 vessels were hijacked and 889 crew members taken hostage, the report said. Eleven crew members were killed and 21 others are missing and presumed dead. The pirates are targeting every kind of vessel and are better armed and prepared to assault and injure the crew, the report said. Incidents involving guns nearly doubled from 72 in 2007 to 139 last year. Pirate attacks last year included the hijacking of the largest ship ever taken by pirates, an oil supertanker called the Sirius Star. Attackers seized the giant ship and its 23-man crew in November and only released it last week after receiving a $3.5 million ransom payment. The carrier's crew was released unharmed. Last year's uptick in hijackings off East Africa has already spurred a number of international navies to patrol the Gulf of Aden. Mukundan said he hoped that more governments would authorize their naval forces to patrol the region. \"International navies are the only ones capable of effective response against piracy in the region and can help to secure the safety and security of this major maritime trade route,\" Mukundan said. Nigeria ranks second in world piracy with 40 reported incidents last year, including five hijackings and 39 crew members kidnapped. The main difference between the East and West African pirate activities is that almost all the incidents in Nigeria are conducted within its territorial waters, whereas most of the incidents along the East coast of Africa and the Gulf of Aden occur on the high seas, the report said. That means vessels in the Gulf area have a much harder time staying away from pirate-infested waters. The motives for the attacks are also different. In Somalia the motives are financial while in Nigeria they are at least partly political, the report said. Under-reporting of piracy in Nigerian waters is also a problem for the International Maritime Bureau, the report said. While 2008 appeared to be a bad year for piracy, the report noted declines in other areas of the world, especially in Indonesia. Mukundan said sustained anti-piracy efforts by Indonesian authorities have resulted in declines every year. More than 121 attacks were reported there in 2003 but only 28 were reported last year, most of which were opportunistic, low-level attacks, Mukundan said. Only two attacks happened last year in the Malacca Straits, which lie between Indonesia and Malaysia, compared to seven the year before, the report said. Farther south, the Singapore Straits saw a slight rise in incidents, going from three to six, the report said. \"This welcome reduction has been the cumulative result of increased vigilance and patrolling by the littoral states and the continued precautionary measures on board ships,\" the report said. \"With the world economy in its present uncertain condition, there is a possibility of piracy increasing. Navies and coast guards must continue therefore to maintain their efforts against pirates.\"", "77ca7b4343422666fd99da0452c51637ec5595a4": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The chief financial officer of India's Satyam Computer Services Ltd. was arrested Saturday, the third person taken into custody in a scandal that began when the company's chairman admitted inflating profits with \"fictitious\" assets and non-existent cash. Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju is shown Saturday being sent to prison in Hyderabad. Vadlamani Srinivas will appear Sunday before a special court, said A. Sivanarayana, additional director general of police in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, told CNN. Company founder B. Ramalinga Raju and his brother, Rama Raju, Satyam's managing director, were arrested Friday in connection with the scandal. In a letter written to investigators, B. Ramalinga Raju admitted that he and his brother were responsible for cooking the books at Satyam, according to CNN's sister network, CNN-IBN. Satyam, India's fourth-largest software-services provider, serves almost 700 companies, including 185 Fortune 500 companies, and generates more than half its revenues from the United States. It employs some 53,000 people and operates in 65 countries. B. Ramalinga Raju resigned Wednesday and confessed to padding company balance sheets. The practice began several years ago to close \"a marginal gap\" between actual operating profit and one reflected in the company's accounting books, he said, but continued for several years. \"It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten,\" B. Ramalinga Raju said in a letter to the company's board of directors. He said no board member was aware of what he was doing and he did not profit from the inflated accounts. The deception came to light after he tried to plug the hole by getting Satyam to buy his son's construction companies. The acquisition was \"the last attempt to fill the fictitious assets with real ones,\" he wrote in his letter. The deal would have cost Satyam $1.6 billion -- but the company's board vetoed it. Stocks fell following the botched deal. Soon afterward, B. Ramalinga Raju came clean, saying he was doing so \"with deep regret, and tremendous burden that I am carrying on my conscience.\" After his confession, stocks of the Hyderabad-based company fell more than 70 percent, causing India's major stock index, the BSE SENSEX, to fall 7.3 percent Wednesday. The BSE SENSEX on Thursday deleted Satyam Computer Services from its indices. The company's interim chief executive officer said Thursday the company's immediate goal is to continue its operations uninterrupted.

Police cannot confirm whether a man attacked this woman because she had a McCain sticker on her car. Public Information Officer Diane Richard said police cannot substantiate her story, however, and the investigation is ongoing. Richard said the 20-year-old told investigators a man approached her Wednesday night at an ATM in the city's East End, put a blade to her neck and demanded money. She said she gave him $60 and stepped away from him, Richard said. But the woman said the man \"became very angry\"  when he noticed her car had a bumper sticker supporting the GOP presidential nominee, according to Richard. The woman said he punched her in the back of the head, knocked her to the ground and \"continued to punch and kick her while threatening her,\" the spokeswoman said. Before he left, the woman said, he carved the letter \"B\" into her face with a knife, according to Richard. There was no indication what the \"B\" indicated. The alleged assailant fled on foot, Richard said. \"We, the police, cannot substantiate this yet,\" she said. \"This is what she told police.\" The woman, who is not from Pittsburgh, refused medical attention, Richard said, although she told the investigating officer she would see a doctor Thursday. There was no update on her condition, she said. Richard said the woman described her alleged attacker as a dark-skinned African-American, 6 feet 4 inches tall with a medium build and short dark hair, wearing dark clothing and shiny shoes. McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker told CNN that McCain and running mate Sarah Palin \"spoke to the victim and her family after learning about the incident earlier this afternoon.\" Hazelbaker said the campaign would not offer more detail out of respect for the woman's privacy. The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama responded to the report with a statement saying, \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the young woman for her to make a speedy recovery, and we hope that the person who perpetrated this crime is swiftly apprehended and brought to justice.\"", "4cb0a311b912e6274d5c40711d19d5febb1fafe9": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Predatory mice are threatening the albatross population on a remote south Atlantic island and have caused the birds' worst nesting season on record, a British bird charity says. Baby albatross on a remote Atlantic island are threatened by killer house mice. The research from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds indicates bad news for the Tristan albatross, whose only home is Gough Island in the middle of the south Atlantic. House mice not native to the island are threatening the Tristan albatross with extinction, the RSPB said. The mice are also threatening the native population of bunting, one of the world's largest finches, the RSPB said. \"Without removal of the mice, both the albatross and the bunting that live there are doomed to extinction,\" Grahame Madge, a conservation spokesman for the RSPB, told CNN. The mice on the island eat the chicks of the albatross and bunting before they make it to the fledgling stage, the RSPB said. This makes it especially difficult for the albatross population to survive because the birds lay eggs only once every two years -- a very low reproductive rate compared to other birds, Madge said. \"What [the mice] are affecting is the ability of the albatross to produce enough young to sustain the population,\" he said. Adult Tristan albatross are threatened by longline fishing at sea, a practice in which boats put up numerous 100-meter long fishing lines baited with squid or fish. The albatrosses are attracted to the bait and while some manage to steal it successfully, many more get snagged and drown, Madge said. Because of the impact from house mice, introduced to the island by sealers in the 18th and 19th centuries, conservation alliance BirdLife International earlier this year listed both the Tristan albatross and the Gough bunting as critically endangered -- the highest threat level before extinction. Gough Island, a British territory almost midway between Argentina and South Africa, is a place of stunning natural beauty. The island is not inhabited by humans. Gough Island and nearby Inaccessible Island are both listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites. A survey of the albatross on Gough Island in January showed 1,764 adults incubating eggs, the RSPB said. A later survey revealed only 246 chicks had survived to fledgling. \"We've known for a long time that the mice were killing albatross chicks in huge numbers,\" said RSPB scientist Richard Cuthbert, who recently visited the island to assess the problem. \"However, we now know that the albatrosses have suffered their worst year on record.\" The bunting suffer because the mice eat their eggs and chicks, and may also compete with them for food in the winter, Cuthbert said. \"The decline in bunting numbers is alarming,\" said Peter Ryan of the University of Cape Town, who has been studying buntings on the island since the 1980s. \"Without urgent conservation action to remove the mice, both the albatross and the bunting are living on borrowed time.\" The RSPB has been studying whether it is possible to remove the mice. It said trials so far look promising, but it urged the British government to step up funding for the project. It said eradicating the mice from Gough Island would solve the primary conservation threat facing both bird species. The RSPB said it had been working with New Zealand conservationists on a program to remove the smaller mice by dropping poisoned bait from helicopters. Tristan albatrosses are one of 22 species of albatross in the world. Albatrosses principally live in the southern Atlantic but some also live in the Pacific, the RSPB says. Albatrosses are among the largest flying birds, weighing up to 25 pounds (22.5 kilograms). One species -- the wandering albatross -- has a wingspan of 11 feet, the RSPB says. The birds can fly thousands of miles without a pause, and their only need to touch land is to nest and raise their young, the RSPB says.", "c535d768722a0802eee80d425085249949bb4e9f": "(CNN)  -- Ten co-workers from New Jersey say they will split a $216 million Mega Millions jackpot, thanks to the five bucks they each kicked into a pool. Melanie Jacob, Linda Harrington and Bob Space, who bought the tickets, are three of the lucky winners. The 10, who work for Chubb Commercial Insurance in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, held a news conference Wednesday to announce their win. Bob Space of Toms River, New Jersey, held up a lottery ticket that clearly showed the winning numbers from Tuesday's drawing: 26, 32, 35, 43, 52 and 10. \"I checked and I rechecked and then I sent it to my wife,\" said Space, who purchased 50 sets of lottery numbers for himself and his nine co-workers from a Singin Oil gas station near his house on Monday.  Watch man describe buying winning ticket \u00bb . Space went to work as usual on Wednesday morning, playing it coy. \"I got an e-mail,\" said Todd Ellis, the company's chief information officer. \"It said, 'We won the big one' and then he just put the numbers down.\" Joanne Roth got the same e-mail. \"I thought we won $4, because last week we won $7,\" she said. \"I said, 'Don't mess with me.' \" Space played hardball with co-worker Oscar Oviedo, who hadn't paid him yet for his share of the lottery tickets. \"This morning, I come into work early with him,\" said Oviedo, who soon received an instant message from Space. \"I got a surprise for you. Come over,\" the message said. Oviedo went to Space's cubicle. \"He's like, 'You got my money?' \" Oviedo said he thought, \"Wow, that was rude,\" but paid up. Space shook his hand and said: \"Now you're a millionaire.\" They aren't officially millionaires at this point, because the winning ticket hasn't been presented to lottery officials yet. \"In due time,\" Space said. \"We have a year.\" But another Chubb employee said they'll cash in their ticket soon. \"If you have that winning ticket ... please sign the back of the ticket, put it in a safe place and seek legal and financial advice before you come to talk to us,\" New Jersey Lottery spokesman Dominick DeMarco said at the news conference, held at the gas station where the winning ticket was sold. \"Be careful with it.\" None of the co-workers, who have been with Chubb for seven to 30 years, said they had immediate plans to quit. The ticket is worth an estimated $216 million if the money is paid out over 26 years, or about $140 million if they choose an immediate cash payout. \"It relieves a lot of stress ... and it also gives a nice cushion to be able to help the people we want to help,\" Ellis said. \"I feel incredibly blessed.

Playboy issued an apology after outrage erupted over this cover of the magazine's Mexican edition. Playboy Mexico has said the cover was not meant to portray the Virgin Mary, despite being printed just days before the Feast of the Immaculate Conception and the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe -- both Catholic holidays centering on the Virgin Mary. CNN's Rick Sanchez sat down with CNN Espa\u00f1ol's Glenda Umana and Father Albert Cutie, a Radio La Paz host, to discuss the reaction among Mexicans and Catholics. The transcript has been edited for clarity. Rick Sanchez: What is going on in Mexico and how big a deal is this?  Watch the controversy over the Playboy cover \u00bb . Glenda Umana: ... there has not been a lot of publicity. It's very interesting, but certainly it has been very, very offensive, not only for the Catholics in Mexico, but all Catholics worldwide. As we can see, this Mexican version of Playboy magazine shows the cover of a model as you were explaining -- Mar\u00eda Florencia Onori from Argentina -- posing like the Virgin Mary. This was published last week on the exact date, Rick, when millions of Mexicans celebrate the festival of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Very important, not only for Mexicans but for all Latino-Americans. Sanchez: So the timing is interesting here. Let me read to the viewers, because we contacted the magazine... Umana: You have a reaction from them, right? Sanchez: We do. It's right here. This is from the publisher of the magazine, Raul Sayrols. He says, \"The image is not and never was intended to portray the Virgin of Guadalupe,\" -- which is the Virgin Mary -- \"The intent was to portray a renaissance-like mood on the cover.\" Interesting. Let me bring in somebody for whom this hits home. He's one of the best known priests in the United States. His name is Father Cutie. I worked with him in Miami many times, has his own show -- actually he's got his own book out now. It's called \"Real Life, Real Love.\" Bestseller, by the way. Father, are we as Catholics just too sensitive when it comes to this kind -- after all, it's a beautiful woman being shown to represent what is, in our minds, to all of us, a beautiful woman. Father Albert Cutie: Listen, there's no doubt that she's a beautiful woman. But a stained-glass window and the veil that looks like that, certainly there's a reference to Mary. Whoever tells you there isn't is simply being hypocritical or not very honest. And that's what I don't like about the statement from Playboy magazine. I think that they timed it not only with the Virgin of Guadalupe, as Glenda was saying, but also with the month of December. How many nativity scenes are out there this time of the year? How many times is Mary a central figure in this whole celebration? And this is offensive. This is very offensive. It's blasphemous. Sanchez: As a matter of fact, Father -- . Cutie: It's wrong. Sanchez: Father, we got one statement from him. But let me read you the entire statement he had put out earlier in the day, \"The image is not and never was intended to portray the Virgin of Guadalupe or any other religious figure.\" He goes on to say -- \"or any other religious figure.\" Now, on its face, as you look at this picture, that looks like a bald-faced lie, doesn't it? Cutie: No, and not only that, this is someone who obviously has no scruples. And I'm not talking about the model -- whoever assigned this whole thing. First of all, we don't adore Mary; we adore God, only God. And to say \"Te Adoramos Mar\u00eda,\" the Spanish -- \"We adore you, Mary\" -- basically, it's making a direct religious reference to something which is sacred. Because you don't adore anything if it's not sacred. So to us, really it's a double offense... Sanchez: And by the way, the emphasis, \"Te Adoramos,\" as you know, being Cuban yourself, that word in Spanish has even more of a heightened religious meaning than it does in English. Cutie: That's right. It means that you love someone -- . Sanchez: Hail -- you hail them. Cutie: That's right. That's right. Now, in the cover of a magazine of a porn business that is already a huge success, why would you need to use religious symbols to sell more magazines? This sounds desperate to me. And not only desperate, it's totally offensive to a billion Catholics in the world and to non-Catholics who honor Mary as the mother of Jesus.", "e07118e00a8fa961f27be12a05a8023e26697753": "(CNN) -- After deliberating for more than four hours, a jury convicted a Nevada man of 22 counts Tuesday for videotaping himself sexually assaulting a toddler, CNN affiliates report. Chester Arthur Stiles has been convicted of videtaping a sexual assault on a child. Chester Arthur Stiles, 38, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. He was convicted of lewdness with a child, sexual assault with a minor, attempted sexual assault with a minor and other related charges. He showed no reaction as the verdict was read after more than four hours of jury deliberations, according to KLAS. Sentencing was set for May 8. The crime triggered a national manhunt and search for the girl when the tape surfaced in 2007. Jurors in Stiles' trial viewed the videotape, but the judge would not allow members sitting in the gallery to view it, and a screen was put up to block the jury box, said Michael Sommermeyer, spokesman for Clark County, Nevada, courts. Some members of the media were allowed to view the tape as well, but the judge did not want the reactions of reporters or the public to influence jurors, he said. The charges also related to another girl who Stiles was accused of sexually assaulting on videotape. The tape was given to authorities in September 2007 by a man who said he had found it in the desert five months before. On it, police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted. After attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl's identity, authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl, and the case drew nationwide attention. She was found in October 2007. An attorney for her mother said she was 7 years old and safe and healthy. The rape occurred before the girl's third birthday, while she was in the care of a baby-sitter her mother had hired, he said. The mother did not know the girl had been victimized. After the girl was found, authorities asked CNN and other news organizations to stop showing her picture. In an appearance on \"The Dr. Phil Show,\" the girl's mother said the girl has no recollection of the assault. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was arrested in a traffic stop in October 2007. Police said at the time they pulled Stiles' car over because it had no license plate, and became suspicious when the driver displayed an expired California license with a photo that did not match his appearance. Stiles eventually admitted who he was and that he was being sought, authorities said. The man who turned the tape over to authorities, Darrin Tuck, faced criminal charges because of the delay in turning it over, during which authorities alleged he showed it to others. A judge gave Tuck a one-year suspended sentence and three years of probation in April after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct a public officer, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He initially had faced a felony count of possession of child pornography.", "53ba087075d251f2f69c4f73fca48a32f298997a": "(CNN) -- A \"faulty\" flight instrument contributed to the crash of a Turkish plane last month in the Netherlands, an accident that killed nine people and injured more than 60 others, Dutch safety authorities said on Wednesday. Turkish Airlines workers carry the coffins of four staff who died in the crash. On February 25, Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 from Istanbul to Amsterdam dropped from the sky on approach to the landing strip at Schiphol Airport, shattering into three pieces in a muddy field. Pieter van Vollenhoven, head of the Dutch Safety Board, said the instrument was one of the plane's two altimeters, which measure altitude. Because of the \"faulty\" left altimeter, the plane on automatic pilot reacted as if it were lower than it was and started to behave as if it was touching down. The plane was at 700 meters but the instrument indicated that it was at ground level. This caused the automatic throttles to slow the plane down, leading to a loss of speed. The plane was on automatic pilot when it crashed. Van Vollenhoven said there had been misty weather and if it were clearer then the pilots might have noticed how far up they were. He said that if such instruments don't function, automatic pilots should not be used for landings. Investigators said there had been faulty meter readings on two other flights but the pilots were able to land. Van Vollenhoven said that the pilots realized the problem but failed to appreciate what had been happening until it was too late. In the immediate aftermath of the crash investigators said the plane fell almost vertically to the ground indicating the aircraft did not have enough forward speed. The plane crash less than 500 yards short of the runway. Passengers described feeling the plane suddenly drop before impact, and at least one passenger said he heard the pilot trying to give more power to the engines before it went down. Four of the crew and three Boeing employees were among the nine people killed in the crash. Turkey's flagship airline is well-rated internationally for its overall safety record and the Boeing 737-800 has a good safety record. The last previous fatal incident at the Amsterdam airport happened in April 1994 when a KLM aircraft crashed as it tried to return to Schiphol shortly after takeoff.", "80b61c14bd7dddec9e965f10da23391c08febabb": "(CNN) -- An Illinois sheriff filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against the owners of craigslist, accusing the popular national classified-ad Web site of knowingly promoting prostitution. \"Craigslist is the single largest source of prostitution in the nation,\" says Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart. Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart wants craigslist to eliminate its Erotic Services section. \"Craigslist is the single largest source of prostitution in the nation,\" Dart said. \"Missing children, runaways, abused women and women trafficked in from foreign countries are routinely forced to have sex with strangers because they're being pimped on craigslist.\" The FBI found more than 2,800 child prostitution ads posted on craigslist, with Chicago, Illinois, in the top 10 cities for juvenile prostitution, Dart said. The sheriff also noted instances of what he said was child neglect while parents were engaged in activity solicited on the Web site. In an e-mailed statement, craigslist told CNN it had not seen Dart's complaint but that \"craigslist is an extremely unwise choice for those intent on committing crimes, since criminals inevitably leave an electronic trail to themselves that law enforcement officers will follow.\" \"On a daily basis, we are being of direct assistance to police departments and federal authorities nationwide,\" spokeswoman Susan McTavish said. \"Misuse of craigslist to facilitate criminal activity is unacceptable, and we continue to work diligently to prevent it,\" she said. \"Misuse of the site is exceptionally rare compared to how much the site is used for legal purposes. Regardless, any misuse of the site is not tolerated on craigslist.\" But Dart said that the Web site for two years has ignored his written requests to shut down the Erotic Services section and failed to take action or adequately monitor the section despite hundreds of arrests. \"Pimps are preying on the most vulnerable members of our society and taking advantage of our struggling economy,\" he said. \"The worst part is craigslist's owners know their Web site is still being used for illegal purposes and they're doing nothing to stop it.\" Craigslist entered into an agreement with 43 states' attorneys general in November to enact measures that impose restrictions on its Erotic Services section. The agreement called for the Web site to implement a phone verification system for listings that required ad posters to provide a real telephone number that would be called before the ad went public. Craigslist also imposed listing fees, requiring a credit card, for ads in the section. The proceeds were to be donated to charity. Dart called the fees \"dirty money\" and said the move was a \"publicity stunt\" that had little practical effect because pimps use stolen credit cards or post ads in free sections.", "a4c5f7cf63b76943f9bbb1e3097818a4195108bc": "(CNN) -- President Barack Obama will make his first overseas trip since taking office at the end of this month, visiting England, France, Germany and the Czech Republic, the White House said Thursday.

Judge Robert Rosenberg examines a ballot in Broward County, Florida, during the election recount in 2000. At issue in recent days in Palm Beach County is a local judicial race that is hardly of national note. But problems with administering the local election, and statements from county officials that some critics call confusing, if not contradictory, have some worried about the coming presidential election. Polls showing a dead heat in the battle for Florida's 27 electoral votes only add to the drama. \"Managerially, software-wise, procedure-wise, training-wise, there is no confidence that these people will be ready in less than 50 days for the election we are all going to have,\" said Sid Dinerstein, the Palm Beach County Republican chairman. \"Never again!\" was the county's promise after the butterfly ballots and hanging chads of the 2000 recount drama. For 2004, the county switched to touch-screen machines. There were no major issues here. But some local Democrats, including Rep. Robert Wexler, demanded changes because they said the touch-screen system might be vulnerable to fraud and did not, in their view, provide a reliable audit trail. So the county switched again, to its third system in eight years, this time a paper ballot that is scanned by an optical reading device. The paper is then retained in case of recounts or other irregularities. Local officials say the system works and promise a smooth Election Day. But Dinerstein says the recount in the judicial race proves the folly of switching. \"We could have had nice, reliable computers counting and giving all of us an honest count,\" he said in an interview. The 2000 recount drama led to major changes -- more than 40 states made changes or adjustments to the way they conducted and administered elections. \"We have had more change in our election process since 2000 than we have seen since the Voting Rights Act of 1965,\" said Indiana Secretary of State Todd Rokita, a recent past president of the national association of top state elections officials. Indiana alone spent some $67 million on new equipment, including a statewide voter file, and also requires a color photo ID on Election Day. Rokita takes issue with those who question the reliability of newer, high-tech systems. \"You know, we use technology in every one of our financial transactions and social transactions -- why did we not until 2000 put that type of technology to use when it comes to our most sacred civic transaction, you know, the voting process?\" Rokita asked in an interview at his office in Indianapolis. \"The technology is just a tool. And what the conspiracy theorists want you to believe is the technology runs the election -- and nothing could be further from the truth,\" he said. \"If you have well-trained people who know how to use that technology and those tools, to know what to do if a battery dies on election day, all those things, then you will have a fair and an accurate election and the people are the ones who will produce that. And If they are not trained and they are not prepared, then you are not going to have a good election. But it is the people, not the machines.\" Indiana expects a record number of new voters this year, and Rokita is changing his usual advice as a result. In the past he has encouraged voting on Election Day, saying it builds community spirit and gives voters up to the last moment to ponder their choices. But this year, given the high interest in his state and nationwide, he suggests voters who are certain they will not change their minds help ease the burden -- and the potential for mistakes on Election Day -- by taking advantage of any early voting options in their states.", "7130a2e14e23fa4b4129c7900ed222e355f73b40": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- For years Ahmad has been unable to find true love.

In Iran, Islamic law restricts social interaction. \"You can't just go after someone in public and say would you like to live with me?\" Ardabili said. \"Especially the women, who often don't have any right to choose their companion, but in our institute women do have the right to choose.\" Ahmad would love nothing more than one of those women to choose him. On a Thursday morning he anxiously sat in the institute's waiting room. Ardabili had arranged for Ahmad to meet a young lady. Could she be the one? Ahmad had paid a $100 fee, submitted a picture and his information. In return he has access to thousands of other applicants. Once applicants approve of one another's pictures and profiles Ardabili arranges up to two meetings inside his office. After each meeting, the applicants report back to Ardabili. \"When there's no connection they look like wrinkled potatoes,\" Ardabili said. And when cupid's arrow hits the mark? \"They look very eager. They're as happy as an ice cream cone.\"  Watch Ardabili describe how his service works \u00bb . The third meeting for couples takes place outside the institute without supervision. If all goes well, Ardabili arranges for the families to meet and then the couple ties the knot. \"You feel good because you're serving humanity,\" Ardabili said. Ardabili said that during the past 10 years his institute has had more than 50,000 applicants. More than 2,000 of his couples have married without a single divorce, he said. Ardabili gave credit to his 10-member staff that offers counseling to married couples, even sex therapy. \"We want to reduce divorce, give families a strong foundation,\" Ardabili said. On his Web site, Tehran's matchmaking mullah has posted wedding pictures of some of his success stories. Ahmad can't wait to see his picture among them. \"At this very moment I'm counting down the days.\"", "c9275d366be81687a8fb2805f327f55f68a41f06": "(CNN) -- Two human-rights activists were shot and killed in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, on Thursday evening, leading a U.N. investigator to call for an independent investigation to prove that Kenyan police were not involved. U.N. invesitgator Phillip Alston said an inquiry into the activists deaths was the only way to eliminate suspicions of police involvement. The shootings spurred a protest by students that led police to fatally shoot a student, police said. A U.N. investigator called the killings of the human-rights workers an assassination. \"It is extremely troubling when those working to defend human rights in Kenya can be assassinated in broad daylight in the middle of Nairobi,\" Phillip Alston said. \"There is an especially strong onus on the Kenyan government to arrange for an independent investigation into these killings, given the circumstances surrounding them.\" Alston said many are suspicious that the police were involved and an independent investigation is the only way to eliminate the suspicion. The Kenyan National Commission on Human Rights also called for an independent probe and planned to hold a news conference Friday. Oscar Kamau Kingara, a longtime critic of Kenyan police, was fatally shot while driving near the the state house, the home of Kenya's president. Kingara's colleague John Paul Oulu also was killed by the gunmen, who fled. Kingara founded the Oscar Foundation, an organization that provides legal aid to the poor in Kenya. He released a report last year alleging that Kenyan police had killed or kidnapped more than 500 people in an effort to control a gang in the country called the Mungiki. Both men also provided information to the United Nations this year that helped the organization release a scathing report about police brutality and police killings in Kenya. The U.N. report released in late February accused Kenyan police of widespread extrajudicial killings, and called for the removal of the East African nation's police commissioner and its attorney general. Kenyan police said in a statement Friday that investigators were looking for two suspects who were seen fleeing after the shootings of Kingara and Oulu. Police also said they would investigate three officers who shot at college students who protested after the human rights activists were killed. \"That use of lethal force during this confrontation was unprofessional and uncalled for. It has also been confirmed one student later died at Kenyatta National Hospital following bullet injuries suffered during this confrontation with the police,\" the police statement said.

Wildfire threatens a house in Edmond, Oklahoma, on Friday. All of the residents, about 400, left the Dewey County town, but have been allowed back in, said Bill Challis with the fire department in Clinton, Oklahoma, south of Taloga. Clinton is among dozens of fire departments helping battle the blaze. Wildfires have been burning in northwest and central Oklahoma since Thursday, according to the state Department of Emergency Management. A large wildfire also came within inches of homes north of Edmond late Friday morning and was still burning during the noon hour, CNN affiliate KOCO reported. Oklahoma Department of Public Safey officials also report that one to two city blocks of Weleetka, in Okfuskee County, were on fire, according to KOCO.

Tsvangirai and his wife, Susan, were en route to the prime minister's hometown of Buhera. The crash, on a busy two-lane highway between Tsvangirai's hometown of Buhera and the capital city of Harare, comes just weeks after the start of a power-sharing agreement between Tsvangirai and his political rival, President Robert Mugabe. Analysts say the crash is bound to raise suspicion of foul play, with one former U.S. diplomat calling for an outside investigation, saying it is not the first time that a political foe of Mugabe has been killed or injured in a car crash. Members of Tsvangirai's political party, the Movement for Democratic Change, said Friday that it was too early to tell whether the crash is anything other than an accident. Tsvangirai's aide and driver also were injured in the head-on collision with a large truck, according to his spokesman, James Maridadi. Movement for Democratic Change spokesman Nelson Chamisa said he spoke to Tsvangirai at the hospital, and the party leader was in \"relatively stable\" condition.  An MDC spokesman describes 'critical' accident \u00bb . Sources at The Avenues Clinic in Harare said that Tsvangirai was in stable condition with minor head injuries and that the prime minister was alert and talking. One source said the attending doctor had told him of his wife's death. Another said that doctors were planning to keep Tsvangirai overnight for observation and that specialists were checking his condition. Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe's main opposition leader, took office last month under a power-sharing deal with Mugabe after a contentious election. Tsvangirai's MDC reached the power-sharing agreement with Mugabe in September after months of angry dispute that included violence. More than 200 deaths, mainly those of opposition supporters, were reported leading up to and in the aftermath of the election. \"I'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in Zimbabwe involving an opposition figure,\" said Tom McDonald, the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe from 1997 to 2001. \"President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone lo and behold dies -- it's sort of his M.O. of how they get rid of people they don't like.\"  Watch more on the fatal crash \u00bb . McDonald cited the 2001 death of Defense Minister Moven Mahachi, Employment Minister Border Gezi's death in 1999 and the death last year of Elliot Manyika, a government minister and former regional governor. All three died in car crashes. \"This is several,\" McDonald said. \"So, when I hear that Tsvangirai was in an accident, it gives me pause.\" McDonald, now an attorney with the Washington law firm Baker Hostetler, urged a full investigation by outside authorities. One analyst who studies the region said the collision could \"exacerbate\" the fragile unity government. \"There will undoubtedly be suspicions about the cause of the crash and whether there was foul play involved,\" said Jennifer Cooke, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \"At a time when there needs to be confidence-building measures, this incident potentially raises suspicions and undermines the potential for greater cohesion of the government. [There is] huge potential for the agreement to be manipulated by Mugabe.\" McDonald, however, was quick to say that traffic accidents are common in Zimbabwe. The highway on which Tsvangirai was traveling is a two-lane road where tractor-trailers are common, vehicles in the country are often in bad shape and drivers often are inexperienced, he said. \"It's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things,\" he said. The collision occurred on the Harare-Masvingo Road as Tsvangirai and his wife headed to his hometown of Buhera, south of the capital, Harare, his spokesman said. The couple, who were married in 1978, have six children, according to the British Broadcasting Corporation. Last month, Susan Tsvangirai told a BBC affiliate that the past decade had been an \"endurance test\" for her husband and his MDC colleagues. \"People went through hell, but they stuck to their ideals to seek change through democratic means,\" she said. \"This was a struggle that we endured with MDC cadres, activists, supporters and peace-loving Zimbabweans. \"To them I say thank you so much for the support they gave the MDC to reach this momentous period.\" A former miner and union organizer, Morgan Tsvangirai first ran for president in 2002 against Mugabe, who has been the country's leader since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1980. Since then, Tsvangirai has been charged with treason twice and accused of plotting to assassinate Mugabe. Tsvangirai was arrested and allegedly beaten in 2007. The criminal charges against him were dropped.

A costumed reveler at a Captain Morgan party celebrates the rum named after the 17th century privateer. We put them in our cocktails, but how well do we know them? Here's some biographical detail on the men behind your favorite tipples: . 1. Captain Morgan . The Captain wasn't always just the choice of sorority girls looking to blend spiced rum with Diet Coke; in the 17th century he was a feared privateer. Not only did the Welsh pirate marry his own cousin, he ran risky missions for the governor of Jamaica, including capturing some Spanish prisoners in Cuba and sacking Port-au-Prince in Haiti. He then plundered the Cuban coast before holding for ransom the entire city of Portobelo, Panama. He later looted and burned Panama City, but his pillaging career came to an end when Spain and England signed a peace treaty in 1671. Instead of getting in trouble for his high-seas antics, Morgan received knighthood and became the lieutenant governor of Jamaica. Mental Floss: 5 drinking stories that put yours to shame . 2. Johnnie Walker . Walker, the name behind the world's most popular brand of Scotch whisky, was born in 1805 in Ayrshire, Scotland. When his father died in 1819, Johnnie inherited a trust of a little over 400 pounds, which the trustees invested in a grocery store. Walker became a very successful grocer in the town of Kilmarnock and even sold a whisky, Walker's Kilmarnock Whisky. Johnnie's son Alexander was the one who actually turned the family into famous whisky men, though. Alexander had spent time in Glasgow learning how to blend teas, but he eventually returned to Kilmarnock to take over the grocery from his father. Alexander turned his blending expertise to whisky, and came up with \"Old Highland Whisky,\" which later became Johnnie Walker Black Label. 3. Jack Daniel . Jasper Newton \"Jack\" Daniel of Tennessee whiskey fame was the descendant of Welsh settlers who came to the United States in the early 19th century. He was born in 1846 or 1850 and was one of 13 children. By 1866 he was distilling whiskey in Lynchburg, Tennessee. Unfortunately for the distiller, he had a bit of a temper. One morning in 1911 Daniel showed up for work early and couldn't get his safe open. He flew off the handle and kicked the offending strongbox. The kick was so ferocious that Daniel injured his toe, which then became infected. The infection soon became the blood poisoning that killed the whiskey mogul. Curious about why your bottle of J.D. also has Lem Motlow listed as the distillery's proprietor? Daniel's own busy life of distilling and safe-kicking kept him from ever finding a wife and siring an heir, so in 1907 he gave the distillery to his beloved nephew Lem Motlow, who had come to work for him as a bookkeeper. Mental Floss: The many myths of Jack Daniel . 4. Jose Cuervo . In 1758, Jose Antonio de Cuervo received a land grant from the King of Spain to start an agave farm in the Jalisco region of Mexico. Jose used his agave plants to make mescal, a popular Mexican liquor. In 1795, King Carlos IV gave the land grant to Cuervo's descendant Jose Maria Guadalupe de Cuervo. Carlos IV also granted the Cuervo family the first license to commercially make tequila, so they built a larger factory on the existing land. The family started packaging their wares in individual bottles in 1880, and in 1900 the booze started going by the brand name Jose Cuervo. The brand is still under the leadership of the original Jose Cuervo's family; current boss Juan-Domingo Beckmann is the sixth generation of Cuervo ancestors to run the company. 5. Jim Beam . Jim Beam, the namesake of the world's best-selling bourbon whiskey, didn't actually start the distillery that now bears his name. His great-grandfather Jacob Beam opened the distillery in 1788 and started selling his first barrels of whiskey in 1795. In those days, the whiskey went by the less-catchy moniker of \"Old Tub.\" Jacob Beam handed down the distillery to his son David Beam, who in turn passed it along to his son David M. Beam, who eventually handed the operation off to his son, Colonel James Beauregard Beam, in 1894. Although he was only 30 years old when he took over the family business, Jim Beam ran the distillery until Prohibition shut him down. Following repeal in 1933, Jim quickly built a distillery and began resurrecting the Old Tub brand, but he also added something new to the company's portfolio: a bourbon simply called Jim Beam. Mental Floss: A bourbon FAQ . 6. Tanqueray . When he was a young boy, Charles Tanqueray's path through life seemed pretty clear. He was the product of three straight generations of Bedfordshire clergymen, so it must have seemed natural to assume that he would take up the cloth himself. Wrong. Instead, he started distilling gin in 1830 in a little plant in London's Bloomsbury district. By 1847, he was shipping his gin to colonies around the British Empire, where many plantation owners and troops had developed a taste for Tanqueray and tonic. 7. Campari . Gaspare Campari found his calling quickly. By the time he was 14, he had risen to become a master drink mixer in Turin, Italy, and in this capacity he started dabbling with a recipe for an aperitif. When he eventually settled on the perfect mixture, his concoction had over 60 ingredients. In 1860, he founded Gruppo Campari to make his trademark bitters in Milan. Like Colonel Sanders' spice blend, the recipe for Campari is a closely guarded secret supposedly known by only the acting Gruppo Campari chairman, who works with a tiny group of employees to make the concentrate with which alcohol and water are infused to get Campari. The drink is still made from Gaspare Campari's recipe, though, which includes quinine, orange peel, rhubarb, and countless other flavorings. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

Benicio Del Toro stars as Latin American revolutionary Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara. \"I have to say it probably is the most difficult movie I've ever made, and I've made a few,\" Del Toro says of his starring role in director Steven Soderbergh's Spanish-language biopic. One of Hollywood's most bankable stars, Del Toro has made a name for himself playing dark and brooding characters in movies like \"21 Grams,\" \"The Usual Suspects,\" and \"Traffic,\" for which he won an Oscar. He now adds to that list the role of revolutionary Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, an Argentine doctor whose role in the Cuban Revolution in the 1950s vaulted him to cult status where he remains today. To play the Latin American revolutionary, Del Toro says he had to start with the man himself rather than invent a character. He read what Che wrote and interviewed a range of people, including those who knew him when he was a child, as well as those who were there in his last days. And then there were the countless photos of the iconic and controversial leader which he pored over. Looking at the pictures, seeing the attitude that he had in the photographs,\" he says, \"I learned a lot from the photographs.\" The meticulous study pays off on screen. Del Toro delivers a soulful performance that has earned him accolades. He won the Best Actor award at Cannes this year and he is being hotly tipped for another Oscar nod. Which films and actors do you think are contenders for this year's Oscars? Share your picks in the SoundOff below. Che's life \"is what movies are made of,\" Del Toro told CNN. The incredible story, along with the opportunity to work with Soderbergh, who directed him in 2000's \"Traffic,\" for a second time drew him to the project. The 41-year-old bilingual actor was born in Puerto Rico but grew up in Pennsylvania. It wasn't until he was in his early 20s and wandered into a bookstore in Mexico City that he discovered Che. \"I bought a compilation of his letters that he had written to his family and I read that book. I didn't know anything about this guy, so that started my journey,\" he recalls.  See how the movie was received in Cuba \u00bb . \"Che\" is split into two parts -- \"The Argentine\" and \"Guerrilla.\" When shown in its entirety, the movie clocks in at a staggering 257 minutes. Part one charts Che's rise from young idealist to revolutionary hero during the Cuban Revolution. Part two depicts his efforts to bring change to all of Latin America and focuses on his campaign in Bolivia, where he died. Shot in various locations ranging from the jungles of Bolivia to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, filming was grueling. \"In this film, we went pretty fast,\" Del Toro says. \"We went really fast.\" Soderbergh wanted to film using only natural light, and production moved rapidly. On some days, Del Toro recounts, they only had 15 or 30 minutes to capture a scene. One day of filming felt like a whole week of work, he says. \"The way I felt on a Monday in this movie is the equivalent to how I felt at the end of the week of another movie.\" Del Toro, who also co-produced the movie, isn't complaining though. He speaks with pride about the effort the cast and crew put in to the moviemaking process, which he describes as \"hit and run.\" \"Che\" is being released in two parts, but the epic is best viewed in its entirety, Del Toro says. \"You'll get the full experience of what we went through, of the two movies together as one.\" The full-length version of \"Che\" will have a limited opening in the U.S. on Dec. 12.

U.S. troops have started joint military exercises with their South Korean counterparts. When Pyongyang took the action, 573 South Koreans were staying at the Kaesong industrial complex, north of the demilitarized zone, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. Many of the stranded South Koreans work at the complex, which is a joint project between the Koreas. \"The South Korean government is closely monitoring the situation and preparing for all contingencies,\" said Kim Ho-nyun, a South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman. \"We emphasize that currently the first priority is the safety of our citizens.\" Eighty South Koreans had applied to cross the border into South Korea on Monday, Kim said, but had not been cleared to do so. \"We are also not certain what will happen to the South Koreans that want to cross tomorrow as well,\" he said. The cross-border developments came as North Korea said it would retaliate if a \"satellite\" launch from its northeastern coast were intercepted, with the communist nation saying interference would \"mean a war.\" \"Shooting our satellite for peaceful purposes will precisely mean a war,\" a spokesman for the North Korean army said in a statement carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). U.S. and South Korean officials have said that North Korea appears to be preparing to test-fire its long-range missile, the Taepodong-2, under the guise of launching a satellite into space. The missile is thought to have an intended range of about 6,700 kilometers (4,200 miles), which -- if true -- could give it the capability of striking Alaska or Hawaii. North Korea's bellicose announcement came on the first day of annual joint military drills between South Korea and the United States. \"We have said several times that the U.S.-South Korean military exercises are annual defensive exercises,\" Kim said. \"We again urge North Korea to maintain the agreed stance of mutual respect and to stop its verbal attacks and actions that are raising tensions on the Korean peninsula,\" he said. The North said it has shut its borders to \"any enemies\" and has cut off \"the North-South military communications in order to guarantee the security.\" North Korea said the military phone lines with the South, the last remaining communications channel, will remain closed until the 12-day military exercises end on March 20, according to Yonhap. Kim said his government is urging North Korea \"to immediately retract this measure and to allow the smooth flow of personnel and communication.\" On Saturday, U.S. envoy Stephen Bosworth said he wants dialogue with North Korea, but he also spoke against North Korea's move to go forward with a launch, saying it would be \"ill-advised.\"", "f63568f91f42bef24b46376b11233bc594204380": "(CNN) -- Fourteen people were missing after a cargo ship sank Monday in Egyptian waters, Red Sea Gov.

A jet engine lost after Flight 1549 ditched in the Hudson River is hoisted from the water Friday. Icy conditions and strong currents hampered efforts to locate and raise the plane's left engine, which apparently tore from the Airbus A320 when it hit the water in an emergency landing January 15. The engine was found Wednesday in about 50 feet of water. The divers who found it reported that it was in one piece, said New Jersey State Police Sgt. Stephen Jones. A crane brought the engine up Friday afternoon as daylight began to fade. It was placed on a barge and hauled to the New Jersey side of the river, according to a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which was supervising the recovery.  Watch the engine pulled from Hudson River \u00bb . After an initial examination at the site, the engine will be shipped with the plane's other engine to the manufacturer, where \"the NTSB will supervise and direct a complete tear-down of each engine,\" NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said. The right engine was still attached to the plane when it was pulled from the Hudson last week. It will be at least next week before any information from the initial examination is released, Knudson said. Investigators said this week that they found a single feather and evidence of \"soft-body impact damage\" on the aircraft. The find reinforces the pilot's report that the plane was brought down by a flock of birds. Pilot Chesley B. \"Sully\" Sullenberger, 58, told investigators that his aircraft struck birds, disabling both engines, about 90 seconds after takeoff from LaGuardia Airport in New York.

See authorities' efforts to retrieve plane \u00bb . The Air Force has been using such systems at its bases for years, and last year the Port Authority -- which operates five metropolitan New York airports -- struck an agreement with the Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration to install the bird-detecting system at John F.

In the wake of the US Airways crash-landing, that program will be expanded to include LaGuardia and Newark International airports within a few months, according to Pasquale DiFulco, spokesman for the Port Authority. Newly released video captured seconds after the Airbus A320 ditched in the Hudson River showed passengers trying to flee the aircraft almost immediately after it settled in the water and began to float along the river current. All 155 crew members and passengers on the plane survived the incident, which Gov. David Paterson dubbed a \"miracle on the Hudson.\" The video, which the Con Edison utility company released Thursday, first shows a long wake behind the plane before zooming in on the aircraft. Steam surrounds the plane as it floats with a slow counterclockwise twist. An exit hatch opens on the plane's left side, and several people file out onto one of the plane's wings.

The parents of Robert Knox read a statement outside the Old Bailey after Karl Bishop was found guilty of his murder. A judge at the Old Bailey court in central London sentenced 22-year-old Karl Bishop on Thursday, the day after he was convicted of the attack on Rob Knox and four of his friends in southeast London last May. Bishop stabbed them 10 times in less than two minutes, the court heard. Knox, 18, had rushed out of the bar after he heard that Bishop had threatened his younger brother Jamie but he ended up being stabbed five times, once in a main artery. He died in hospital later that night. The judge, Mr Justice Bean, told Bishop: \"You are at present a highly dangerous man,\" the Press Association reported. \"There is plainly a very significant risk to the public of serious harm caused by your committing further offences of violence. \"Because you had threatened his younger brother, Rob Knox was among those who tried to disarm you. He paid for his bravery with his life. \"The truth is that you simply could not care less whether you killed him or not. When you learned that you had killed Rob your only response was to say 'Yeah, sweet.'\" Days before the attack, the actor had finished filming on \"Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince,\" due for international release in July, in which he played the role of Marcus Belby. He was set to reprise the part in future \"Harry Potter\" films. Knox's father Colin told mourners at his funeral, including co-star Rupert Grint, that his son had been \"living the dream,\" PA said. The Knox family left the court without commenting, but earlier Rob's mother Sally said of Bishop: \"Once he's got his sentence and he's gone, I will not waste my time thinking about him. \"I just think maybe somebody like him may have some kind of disturbed mind, which may not be due to the life he's had, it just may be something in him.\" Knife crime in Britain is a political hot topic due to a spate of recent killings of mainly young people in major cities.

Helg Sgarbi has admitted blackmailing Germany's richest woman, Susanne Klatten. Susanne Klatten, the BMW heiress, complained to police last year that Helg Sgarbi had threatened to release pictures of them if she did not pay him nearly $60 million. Munich's state prosecutor Anton Winkler said Sgarbi, who was accused of blackmailing several wealthy woman, had made a written confession which was read by his lawyer to the court. \"He confessed that he blackmailed the victims, told them untrue stories,\" Winkler told CNN. However, Sgarbi had not revealed what had happened to the estimated $12.5 million he had taken from his victims nor where the pictures had gone. \"It is really only half a confession. We asked him about where the money is, about accomplices and videos... and he refused to say anything about that,\" Winkler said. Authorities said Klatten, who is married with three children, had an affair with Sgarbi.

The archaeologists from the Universiti Sains Malaysia found the remains of an iron smelting site, tools to pump oxygen into the iron smelting process, rooftops of buildings, beads and pots, said Mokhtar Saidan, a professor and leader of the team. The discovery was made after a month of excavation at Lembah Bujang, a historical site in Malaysia. \"This is the first discovery of the earliest iron industry in Lembah Bujang and has been dated conclusively. This date also adds on to the facts and data on the early history of Southeast Asia,\" he said. He said coal from the site was sent to a laboratory in Florida that said elements in the coal dated to the 3rd Century. The professor said the discovery confirms that human civilization in the area was more advanced than thought and the site probably was a place for exporting iron in the 3rd Century.", "3ddac6ff117cf27efabb2fac8c751921af8c66bb": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- It runs on 100 per cent renewable biodiesel and holds the record for the fastest circumnavigation of the globe in a powerboat -- and now Earthrace is for sale.

(CNN) -- You may not have the answer for how to thrive in a lousy economy. I may not have the answer for how to thrive in a lousy economy. But the truck stop dentist figured it out a long time ago. \"When your dental practice is in a truck stop, you don't have a lot of patients coming in for their six-month cleanings,\" said Dr. Thomas P. Roemer. \"You have people walking in holding their jaws in pain. Treatment is not optional -- they need to see a dentist, and they need to see me now.\" Dr. Roemer's one-man dental office is inside the Iowa 80 Truckstop, at Exit 284 of Interstate 80, near the small town of Walcott. The complex proclaims itself to be the world's largest truck stop, and if you've never been there -- well, the truck stop itself is probably a story for another time. Suffice it to say that the establishment is spread over 200 acres, that it features its own movie theater, a 300-seat restaurant with a 50-foot salad bar, the Super Truck Showroom (more than 75,000 truck-related items for sale, festooned with enough gleaming chrome to make you reach for your sunglasses). But the topic for today is Dr. Roemer, and how he ended up offering root canals in a building where people stop for diesel fuel. These desperate economic times highlight the importance of individual inventiveness and ingenuity -- and a dentist has to be beyond ingenious to gaze upon an Iowa truck stop and figure out: A fellow could make himself a pretty nice living in there. \"I had a regular dental practice over in Davenport,\" Dr. Roemer, 48, told me. \"I had an advertisement in the Yellow Pages. And in the early 1990s I noticed that I kept getting calls from truckers who were in a phone booth out by the Iowa 80 Truckstop. They had stopped for fuel, and they were in a lot of pain, and they absolutely had to see a dentist.\" Now... Walcott, the town adjacent to the truck stop, has only 1,500 residents. But the truck stop itself caters to an estimated 5,000 customers a day, most of them long-haul truckers passing through. The light bulb above Dr. Roemer's head snapped on. \"I made arrangements with the truck stop to open up an office,\" he said. \"At first I split my practice between my old office in Davenport and the truck stop office. But I ended up closing the old one. My entire practice is in the truck stop now.\" Business is good, he said, even during the recession. There have been stories from around the country about doctors and dentists seeing fewer patients, because people just don't have the money to come in for regular checkups. But a truck stop dental office is not a place where patients come because they have planned it -- a truck stop dental office is a place where patients come because they need immediate relief. \"The sentence I hear the most often is, 'Do you pull teeth?'\" Dr. Roemer said. \"Someone will come in with his hand to his face, and he'll want to have a tooth extracted. He will have heard that I'm here.\" But how do truckers learn about Dr. Roemer's practice? \"Word of mouth,\" he said. (So to speak.) The business model of most dental offices, he said, is based on teeth-cleaning: A dentist builds up his or her list of loyal patients and their families who come in to get their teeth cleaned, and when they need fillings or crowns, the office is there for them. The truck stop dentist, by necessity, turns that business model inside out. \"I usually see a patient once, and then never see him again,\" he said. \"Truckers aren't going to say to me, 'I'll be back for a cleaning on September 23 at 2 in the afternoon.' They can't plan where they're going to be. I make patient files for the people who come in, but I know that I'll probably never have a reason to open the files after they walk out the door. These are mostly one-time patients.\" He doesn't have the luxury of knowing, at the beginning of a day, how many patients he will see -- or even if he will see any. \"It can range from zero patients in a day to 15,\" he said. \"It's unusual for a patient to call in advance. I'll know I have a patient when the door opens and a trucker walks in, with that look on his face.\" Dr. Roemer's success, he said, is based on two factors: the steady flow of those 35,000 people who pull in to the truck stop every week, and the actuarial certainty that some of them will be truckers with a mouthful of hurt. \"I had a guy who came in yesterday who told me he was in such pain that he had tried to pull his own tooth,\" Dr. Roemer said. \"I told him there was no need for that. I told him that I could help him.\" It does get a little lonely out at Exit 284, not being able to build up a continuing relationship with his patients, the way most dentists do. Sometimes, as a patient is getting up from the chair to leave, Dr. Roemer will find himself saying: . \"Make sure you try to get your dispatcher to send you back this way.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.", "c7390ea7df4beb896eb7265c4f082ef5ae61b6b1": "(CNN) -- Four survivors of the US Airways Flight 1549 that went down in the Hudson River appeared on \"Larry King Live\" Thursday to discuss a recording of the pilot calmly telling an air traffic controller the plane would ditch. Carl Bazarian, clockwise from left, Vince Spera, Alberto Panero and Brad Wentzell appeared on \"Larry King Live.\" \"We're gonna be in the Hudson,\" pilot Chesley B. \"Sully\" Sullenberger radioed on January 15, about three and a half minutes after the Airbus A320 took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration released the recording on Thursday, a day after the National Transportation Safety Board said both the plane's engines contained the remains of birds. Larry King: Carl, what goes through you when you hear the recording, especially the calmness? Carl Bazarian, survivor: You know, to me -- my son played it for me this morning. I found it incredibly stressful and sobering that we were so close to death. And that's the bad side. And I'm really not keen on hearing it too many more times. But on the other side, it's exhilarating. Again, we were blessed with the best feat in aviation, with the best pilot and co-pilot. That's all I can say. King: Vince, what goes through your mind? Vince Spera, survivor: Larry, the entire conversation that you hear going back and forth is just indicative of how the entire cabin was. It was calm, controlled, but tense. That's really what that conversation started to sound like to me.  Listen to pilot's communication with flight controller \u00bb . King: Alberto? Alberto Panero, survivor: It's filling in pieces to the puzzle. While everything was going on in the plane, we didn't have much information of what was going on actually. So hearing this now kind of fits into the puzzle, where we see where I was at the point when everything was happening in the plane. King: Brad? Brad Wentzell, survivor: It's an amazing thing to hear, not only from our perspective, when we were basically going for a ride, but to hear from the man who -- just him and the Good Lord had our lives in his hand. King: How do you feel, Carl -- you'll see the whole crew with us Tuesday night -- when you hear the captain talk? Bazarian: First thing, he's very honest about it. But I don't know how -- we all had disbelief. It was all surreal. How then he was so energized to exhibit the highest professionalism. I think it's an incredible aviation feat. And my fellow friends, they will comment. But how did he get that composure?  Watch survivors react to hearing the tape \u00bb . We were all panicky. Not panicky, I think Vince is right. We were kind of cool, but concerned, overly concerned. How did he regain himself and do what he did? I don't know how he did it. King: Vince, were there a lot of moments, Vince, when you thought you bought it? Spera: Actually, no. There was never a point in time when I thought I was going to die. Obviously, I think the way the people in the cabin behaved contributed to my feeling that way. It was just a lot of control. We felt like the pilot was in control. Obviously, it all worked out. At no point did I feel like I was going to die. I'm very happy to hear the captain truly didn't feel that way either. King: Alberto, how about when it hit the water? Did you think you were going to go under? Panero: No. I think as soon as we hit the water, we realized that the worst was over and the most important thing was to get out as soon as possible, making sure that the doors got open quickly and that everybody stayed calm and tried to exit as calmly as possible, because at first people were trying to get out quick and trying to push a little bit. But I think everybody realized that the more organized that we did it, the faster we would get out. I think that helped out a lot. King: Brad, the last few weeks, have you had flashbacks? Do you think about it a lot? Wentzell: I've had a few flashbacks. For me the most real thing that I keep playing back in my head is saying goodbye to my family in prayer and saying goodbye to my little daughter, my loved ones, my wife, and waiting to die. It's a very real feeling. I wasn't as optimistic. No one ever knows when they're going to die. I felt that was my time. Apparently, the Good Lord still has a few things for me to do on this Earth. King: Carl, you're looking out the window here, I guess. Bazarian: Yes, I was. King: What are you thinking? Bazarian: The first reality when we hit, I thought, initially, the landing was so good I thought we were back on the tarmac. That was my immediate reaction. But then the water -- immediately, we saw the water out the window. Again, like Vince said, when we saw that daylight of the door opening, it wasn't a herd of people trying to rush out. It was pretty good composure. I guess Vince is right. We picked up on the courage of the crew and the flight attendants. King: Vince, there was one passenger who thought he landed. Spera: Yes. I heard several stories about reactions of different people. Honestly, most of the people knew exactly what was going on and they really just wanted to get out and get to safety. But I did hear somebody attempting to pick up their bag and do some other things like that. Fortunately, most of those people were on the right side of the plane. I got to get out the left. King: Alberto, have you flown since? Panero: Actually, I have. The next day I took a plane home. I figured that was going to be the easiest way to just get over any kind of possible trauma, just get back on the plane. And I just kept focused on seeing my family and friends and that got me through the flight pretty well. And also the lady that was sitting next to me was very nice and just happened to make friendly conversation. So it worked out pretty good. Panero: Brad, have you met the captain? Wentzell: I did meet the captain. That was very real thing. He's just as cool and calm in person as you would expect, for someone who was able to do, from what I believe, no one else on the planet could do. He was very humble. I think we all have been humbled from this experience.", "ebc4c8962079c28f1e94c3d80019a0ad324c14e9": "(CNN) -- Jury selection was under way Thursday in the case of a man accused of sexually assaulting a toddler and capturing it on videotape years ago, a crime that triggered a nationwide manhunt and search for the girl when the tape surfaced in 2007. Chester Arthur Stiles faces life imprisonment if convicted of videtaping a sexual assault on a child. Chester Arthur Stiles, 38, faces 22 felony counts in connection with the videotape, including lewdness with a child, sexual assault with a minor and attempted sexual assault with a minor. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Thursday is the third day of jury selection, said Michael Sommermeyer, spokesman for Clark County, Nevada, courts. Some 200 potential jurors were called, according to CNN affiliate KVBC. As of Thursday morning, only seven jurors had passed on to the next stage of selection, Sommermeyer said. Prosecutors hope to seat 15 jurors eventually, Sommermeyer told CNN, meaning they'll want a pool of about 35 to pick from in the final stage. Picking a jury in the case is challenging, according to KVBC, not only because of the media attention the case has drawn, but because of the crimes Stiles is accused of. A questionnaire given to potential jurors has one question addressing the videotape: \"As a juror, despite the graphic nature of the videotape, can you promise to remain fair and impartial and objectively evaluate all evidence for returning a verdict?\" \"One, you let them know what the case involves and they've heard it on the news, it's a little difficult to get over any preconceived notions that they had about the case,\" defense attorney Stacey Roundtree told KVBC. \"However, we do have faith in this community that they want to do the right thing,\" she said. \"Most of the jury trials I've had, the jurors go out of their way to make the right decision. They go out of their way to follow the judge's rules, and we're confident we can have that happen in this case.\" The tape was given to authorities in September 2007 by a man who said he had found it in the desert five months before. On it, police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted. After attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl's identity, authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl, and the case drew nationwide attention. She was found in October 2007. An attorney for the child's mother said she is 7 years old and safe and healthy. The rape occurred before her third birthday while she was in the care of a baby sitter her mother had hired, he said. The mother did not know the girl had been victimized. After the girl was found, authorities asked CNN and other news organizations to stop showing her picture. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was arrested in a traffic stop in October 2007. Police said at the time they pulled Stiles' car over because it had no license plate and became suspicious when the driver displayed an expired California license with a photo that did not match his appearance. \"He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles,'\" said Henderson, Nevada, police Officer Mike Dye. \"'I'm the guy you're looking for.\" Stiles told police he was \"sick of running,\" Dye said. The mother of the girl shown on the tape, meanwhile, went on \"The Dr. Phil Show\" after Stiles' arrest, saying that while she was \"relieved,\" it would have been \"better if they found him dead.\" She said her daughter remembers nothing about the alleged assault. \"Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through,\" Nye County, Nevada, Sheriff Tony DeMeo said during the manhunt for Stiles. The man who turned the tape over to authorities, Darrin Tuck, faced criminal charges because of the delay in turning it over, during which authorities alleged he showed it to others. A judge gave Tuck a one-year suspended sentence and three years' probation in April after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct a public officer, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He initially had faced a felony count of possession of child pornography.", "cf58f7b65494090da7a8d0afc1ad17cd413fcba9": "(CNN) -- David Goldman says he can't understand why he can't have custody of his son following his ex-wife's death in Brazil. The U.S. government agrees. David Goldman is fighting for custody of his son after Bruna Bianchi Goldman died during another childbirth. Goldman told CNN's Larry King he had no idea when he dropped off his wife and 4-year-old son at Newark International Airport in 2004 for a two-week vacation to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that he was about to become embroiled in an international custody battle. Shortly after Bruna Bianchi Goldman arrived in her homeland she called to say she wanted a divorce, which she obtained in Brazil, and would stay there with their son, Sean. The running custody battle has taken many twists and turns and has gained the attention of the Department of State and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \"A child belongs with his family, and there is no reason why David Goldman should not get his child back,\" Clinton said in a recent interview on NBC's Today show. \"And we're hoping that that will be resolved very soon. Obviously, if not, we will continue to raise it with the Brazilian government.\" For nearly five years, Goldman has fought to regain custody of his son. It's a case that has been complicated by Bianchi Goldman remarrying, getting pregnant and dying during childbirth last summer. Sean Goldman is said to be living with his stepfather, who has been granted provisional guardianship. \"I went down ... to bring my son home,\" Goldman said on CNN's Larry King Live Wednesday, figuring his ex-wife's death had made the custody issue a moot point, and \"we find out that this man doesn't file custody, but he files to remove my name from a Brazilian birth certificate that they had issued for my son, who was born in Red Bank, New Jersey.\" Goldman continues to press his case through the U.S. government. \"The Department of State is working diligently to ensure that David and Sean Goldman are accorded their rights under the Hague Convention of 1980 on the civil right aspect of International Child Abduction,\" the agency said in a statement. \"We'll continue to insist that the Brazilian government fulfill its obligations under the treaty and international law.\" The convention, to which Brazil is a signatory, \"is a multilateral treaty, which seeks to protect children from the harmful effects of abduction and retention across international boundaries by providing a procedure to bring about their prompt return,\" according to the Hauge Convention Web site. Brazilian courts have refused to return Sean Goldman to the United States for any custody hearings that New Jersey courts have ordered and the Brazilian government has not intervened. As a result, the case remains a stalemate. \"I would tell him that he's been very brave, as he has fought to have his son returned to him,\" Clinton said in the NBC interview. \"His son is the most precious person in the world to him and he has gone not just the extra mile, but mile after mile, back and forth, trying to make it clear that his son Sean deserves to be returned to him.\" But on Larry King Live, Helvecio Ribeiro, a Bianchi family spokesman, questioned Goldman's fitness as a parent. \"I don't question the biological right,\" he said. \"The fact of the matter is that in order to be a parent, you have to be more than just a DNA donor, Mr. King. Fatherhood is not about making home movies and taking pictures, it's about sacrifice. It's about providing support to your child. It's about being there even when you're not there. \"And Mr. Goldman, while Bruna was still alive, failed to do so,\" Ribeiro said. Goldman visited his son for the first time in more than four years last month -- a bittersweet experience that was heartbreaking when it was time to return to the United States. \"He asked me why I haven't come to see him in all this time,\" Goldman told Larry King, \"and that was very, very painful -- and the anguish on his face when he asked me that question. I didn't want to tell him that ... they're holding him.\" International custody fights are common and were supposed to be simplified by the 1980 Hauge agreement, but conflicting court systems and conflicting accounts of relationships can trump international law. The next step in this case is uncertain.", "dccf91ff452fc352a372df54a6895785f60d103c": "(CNN) -- A Texas grand jury indicted polygamous sect leader Warren Jeffs on sexual assault charges, and five of his followers also face a variety of charges, state Attorney General Greg Abbott said. Members of the polygamous FLDS revere jailed leader Warren Jeffs as their prophet. Jeffs was charged in the Tuesday indictment with sexual assault of a child, a first-degree felony. A conviction on the charge could mean a maximum penalty of five to 99 years or life in prison and a fine of $10,000, said Dirk Fillpot, a spokesman for the attorney general. Jeffs, 52, is the so-called leader and \"prophet\" of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which broke off from mainstream Mormonism in the 1890s over the practice of polygamy. The FLDS openly practices polygamy at its Yearning for Zion Ranch outside Eldorado, Texas, and in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state line: Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Jeffs is accused in the indictment of assaulting a child \"younger than 17 years of age and not legally married to the defendant\" in January 2005. The alleged victim, whose name is redacted on the document, \"was a person who the defendant was prohibited from marrying or purporting to marry or with whom the defendant was prohibited from living under the appearance of being married\" under Texas law. The indictments, which were handed down by a grand jury in San Angelo, Texas, also charge four of Jeffs' followers with single counts of sexually assaulting a girl under the age of 17. One of the four also faces a count of bigamy. A fifth follower is charged with three counts of failure to report child abuse. The Texas attorney general's office was cooperating with other agencies to ensure the five others would be taken into custody, Fillpot said. Their names have not been made public, and only Jeffs' indictment has been released. Jeffs has been in custody since August 2006, when he was arrested during a routine traffic stop after spending several months on the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives list. Jeffs is serving two consecutive sentences of five years to life in prison on accomplice to rape charges in Utah for his role in the marriage of a sect member to his 14-year-old cousin. He is being held Arizona while he awaits trial on similar charges. It was not immediately clear when Jeffs would be brought to Texas. Authorities seized more than 400 children in April during a raid on the Texas ranch. The children were returned to their families after the Texas Supreme Court ruled the state had no right to remove the children and lacked evidence to show they faced imminent danger of abuse. In May, DNA samples were taken from Jeffs as part of a criminal investigation into allegations that he \"spiritually\" married four girls ranging in age from 12 to 15, authorities said. A search warrant seeking the DNA samples said marital records -- known as bishop's records -- from the ranch show that Jeffs married a 14-year-old girl on January 18, 2004, in Utah. The records showed that Jeffs \"married\" two 12-year-olds and a 14-year-old at the YFZ Ranch, according to the search warrant. One of the 12-year-olds, believed to have married Jeffs on July 27, 2006, was sexually assaulted by Jeffs later that day, the search warrant said. The warrant made reference to pictures of Jeffs with his alleged underage brides. In one photograph, the warrant states, he is kissing one of the 12-year-olds. In another, he is shown with a 15-year-old wife at the birth of their child in October 2004. Authorities had said the DNA samples would determine whether he is the father of the children born to underage mothers. FLDS spokesman Rod Parker, who is vacationing in Colorado this week, had no immediate comment on the indictment Tuesday. \"As far as an indictment of Warren Jeffs, I'd want to know a little more before I start talking about it,\" he said. On Thursday, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee is planning to hold a hearing on polygamy and the need for a \"coordinated state and federal response,\" according to an agenda. Carolyn Jessop, a former FLDS member who recently wrote a book about leaving her marriage and the sect, is scheduled to testify, along with federal prosecutors, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and the attorneys general of Texas and Arizona.", "4d90ee3bff00c3e88ee985d98f6cc1c45194539a": "(CNN) -- Wiping tears from his cheeks, a man who survived avalanches that killed eight snowmobilers in western Canada said Wednesday that he and two others tried to save their friends but eventually left the mountain because of the threat of more slides. Jeffrey Adams says he freed himself and helped free two others before making a \"gut-wrenching\" decision to leave. Jeffrey Adams, with his his fianc\u00e9e at his side, said he and the two other survivors \"did everything we could to try to save\" the eight Sunday. \"They died doing what they loved. ... I'm truly sorry to the families that we couldn't find them,\" Adams said. Adams described digging himself out after the avalanches struck the group Sunday in British Columbia about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) east of Fernie, a town in the Canadian Rockies about 300 kilometers (186 miles) southwest of Calgary, Alberta. Both avalanches left him buried but near the surface, he said. He was able to dig himself out, choking on snow, and free a second companion without gloves or gear.  Watch Adams describe digging himself, others out \u00bb . Adams and six others had been snowmobiling near the base of a mountain when the first avalanche happened, he said. The avalanche buried him for \"a minute or two,\" but he was able to free himself. He started digging for a companion as another group of four people showed up to help, Adams said. One called 911 on a transmitter. But then they heard a crack, and a second slide buried all 11 of them, Adams said. Miraculously, he said, only 8 to 10 inches of snow covered him. \"When I opened my eyes, I could see daylight,\" he said. \"I was digging. I managed to get my mouth free. I was already choking. I took a few breaths. After about five minutes of struggling, I got myself out, looked around and realized there wasn't anybody else -- couldn't see any sleds, no gear, nothing.\" He yelled for his friends and heard an answer, and he was able to dig out one man, whom he identified as Jeremy. The two were working on freeing a third man, James, when they heard another crack. \"We said, 'Sorry, James, we've got to run,' \" Adams remembered tearfully. \"As we were running away from James, he was saying, 'Don't leave me here! Don't leave me here!' We kept saying we're sorry. We went off and sat to the side, and the slide never hit us in the area we were in. We just got the snow cloud. We went back in and finally got James out.\" But then the three looked around and saw no one. They considered getting the one snowmobile that wasn't struck by the avalanche, but determined that the area was too unsafe. \"That's when we had to make the gut-wrenching decision to leave our eight friends and start walking off the mountain,\" an emotional Adams said. The group had walked for about 10 minutes and was thinking of going back, but when he turned to look, \"the whole center of the mountain came down\" in a fourth avalanche. \"We just decided our best bet was to keep walking,\" he said. They were hoping for a helicopter in response to the earlier 911 call, he said, and one eventually arrived and picked them up. Searchers found seven bodies Monday and the eighth Tuesday. Royal Canadian Mounted Police identified the dead as Danny Bjarnason, 28; Kane Rusnak, 30; Warren Rothel, 33; Michael Stier, 20; Len Stier, 45; Blayne Wilson, 26; Kurt Kabel, 28; and Thomas Talarico, 32. Adams and the other two survivors, James and Jeremy -- whose last names and ages were not given -- suffered minor injuries. One was hospitalized overnight. \"It's hard,\" Adams said. \"I replay it in my head all the time whether it was the right decision or not.\" He said he had spoken with the families of most of the other men. \"So far, all of them are supporting our decision to leave,\" he said. \"It was a hard one, to leave eight guys up there.\" He described the victims as \"good buddies,\" his voice breaking. Experts told him the second avalanche hit the group at 150 kph (93 mph), Adams said. He estimated the wall of snow was 15 feet high. He said members of the group knew the avalanche danger was high, and that's why they weren't climbing the mountain. Even buried under a few inches of snow, \"you don't know what way is up and what is down,\" he said. \"You can't move. You simply can't move in it,\" Adams said. The snowmobilers were from Sparwood, British Columbia. They were in an area called Harvey Pass, which police called \"a popular backcountry snowmobile destination.\" Sparwood Mayor David Wilks said all the victims were upstanding citizens who worked as businessmen or in coal mines. The mayor said temperatures were as low as minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit in recent weeks, though the air had warmed to 25 degrees Fahrenheit.

Thirty bodies have been identified: 29 Thai nationals and one Singaporean, according to police. The fire began at the nightclub Santika about 12:35 a.m., police said. Rescue officials said 226 others were injured, including several foreigners. Two Americans were injured in the blaze, a U.S. State Department official said. The official did not release the victims' names or the extent of their injuries but said the department was in contact with them. Steven Hall, a British national who was hurt in the fire, told CNN that flames began to spread along the ceiling above the stage where a band and DJ were performing. But some people appeared to believe that it was part of the performance. \"At the same time there were people rushing to get out, there were other people who seemed to be lacking a sense of urgency and didn't seem to realize what was going on,\" Hall said. The blaze started near a stage where fireworks were being used as part of a performance on the club's closing night, said police Maj. Gen. Chokchai Deeprasertwit.

Its Web site features images of bands and DJs performing on both indoor and outdoor stages, and says that it \"innovatively blends the comfort of nature with the excitement of the Bangkok nightlife.\" The site advertises the club's New Year's party, which was named \"Goodbye Santika.\" CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.", "8452f5f3bbb0d04af6380fe84966d2c98d59266d": "(CNN) -- Authorities Tuesday recovered the body of an eighth missing snowmobiler buried in avalanches in southern British Columbia, a spokesman for the the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. Authorities found seven bodies a day after avalanches in British Columbia, Canada. Sgt. Tim Shields said the body was recovered around 11:38 a.m. The seven other bodies were recovered Monday. Their identities were not immediately released. David Wilks, mayor of Sparwood, the small town where the snowmobilers lived, said all were men in their 20s. The eight men, and three others who escaped, faced two avalanches Sunday about 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of Fernie, a town in the Canadian Rockies about 300 kilometers (190 miles) southwest of Calgary, Alberta. The three survivors suffered minor injuries, and one was hospitalized overnight. The men had been in an area called Harvey Pass, which police called \"a popular backcountry snowmobile destination.\" Police said an avalanche buried part of the group and, as others came to help them, a second avalanche buried them. \"Two of the buried riders managed to self-rescue within about 20 minutes. These two used their avalanche beacons to locate a third buried victim who they rescued after an additional 20 minutes of digging,\" police said. The mayor described the snowmobilers as upstanding citizens, most of them working in coal mines or as businessmen. \"All were well aware of the dangers involved in snowmobiling. All are very cautious with what was going on,\" Wilks said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laugh about their \"reset' button. When Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greeted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday before sitting down to their working dinner, she presented him a small green box with a ribbon. Inside was a red button with the Russian word \"peregruzka\" printed on it. \"I would like to present you with a little gift that represents what President Obama and Vice President Biden and I have been saying and that is: 'We want to reset our relationship and so we will do it together.'\" Clinton, laughing, added, \"We worked hard to get the right Russian word. Do you think we got it?\" she asked Lavrov. \"You got it wrong,\" Lavrov said.\" Both diplomats laughed. \"It should be \"perezagruzka\" (the Russian word for reset,) Lavrov said. \"This says 'peregruzka,' which means 'overcharged.'\" The question came up at the news conference afterward. \"In a way, the word that's on the button turns out to be also true,\" Clinton said. \"We are resetting, and because we are resetting, the minister and I have an overload of work.\" Asked by a Russian reporter whether he had pressed the button, Lavrov said that he and Clinton did, indeed. \"It is big and red and I hope that Russia and the United States, and other countries will never press on another button which used to be associated with a destructive war,\" he said. The \"overload,\" Clinton said, is a broad agenda of issues. \"We are going to systematically go through each and every one of them,\" she added. Clinton said the two sides will get to work on re-negotiating a follow-up to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and nonproliferation. On other issues like Afghanistan, the Middle East and Iran, Clinton said, \"We will work through them.\" On issues where there is disagreement, Clinton said, \"We are keeping those on the list because, we think through closer cooperation and building trust in each other, we can even tackle some of those differences.\" Lavrov agreed the burden of the agenda for the two countries is \"enormous,\" but added: \"I don't think either Hillary or I have any desire to be freed from any burden.\" Clinton called the encounter \"a very productive meeting of the minds.\" She said both Lavrov and she are \"very practical-minded\" and will create a \"specific set of objectives and responsibilities\" to present to presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev before the leaders' first face-to-face meeting in April at the G-20 meeting in London. On the START treaty, she said Russia and the United States intend to have an agreement by the end of this year when the treaty expires and are \"going to get to work immediately\" on it. Lavrov was asked about Russian intentions to install S-300 missiles in Iran. He said the decision \"will be made exclusively on the basis of law in accordance with Russian law, and will be under expert control, which is one of the strictest in the world and of course in accordance with international agreements.\" Lavrov said the weapons Russia provides to its partners are \"nondestabilizing, defensive weapons.\" In an apparent reference to U.S. military supplies to Georgia, Lavrov said, \"We want our partners to act the same way and show restraint in military supplies to those countries where, including very recently, those weapons have been used very close to our borders.\" Senior U.S. officials who briefed reporters afterward, however, said they had not read Georgia into the minister's comments. They said the discussion ranged broadly over a number of areas and \"we now have a very substantive work agenda that they just outlined.\" \"It would have been easier and in a first meeting almost natural to be much more general but in this case it was very focused and very productive in laying out steps,\" one official said. On the proposed missile defense system the United States is considering installing in Poland and the Czech Republic, one official said, \"Minister Lavrov made it clear he had listened quite attentively to Secretary Clinton's comments about missile defense ... and I think it's got them thinking.\"", "0206f486c821d39f12fa4d3b62b1fe8cbaf3ded6": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- You are about to meet Mr. Brown. David Mann and Tamela Mann -- a real-life couple -- star in \"Meet the Browns\" as father and daughter. He's David Mann, star of the TBS sitcom \"Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns.\" To borrow a phrase from the network's marketing -- he's very funny. Mann's character -- \"Downtown\" Leroy Brown -- is a lovable, sometimes outrageous and always off-the-wall senior citizen who has stolen every scene he's entered in Tyler Perry's plays, movies and TV shows. Mr. Brown no longer has to steal scenes, because TBS -- owned by CNN parent company Time Warner -- has ordered 80 episodes of half-hour comedy, based on the success of 10 pilot episodes. \"Just in case I'm dreaming, don't pinch me,\" said Mann. \"I'm living the dream.\" \"Meet the Browns\" is a spinoff of Perry's \"House of Payne,\" a sitcom that has yielded strong cable ratings for TBS, and it employs some of the same characters seen in Perry's movies and stage plays -- including a play and film named \"Meet the Browns,\" which is only mildly related to the TV series. The show focuses on Mr. Brown and his daughter Cora, played by Mann's real-life wife, Tamela Mann, as Mr. Brown tries to turn his house into a home for the elderly. Those who have followed Perry's productions know that Cora was the conceived during a brief fling between Brown and Madea, Perry's female alter ego. \"If it hadn't been for Cora, Mr. Brown and Madea probably would have killed each other by now,\" Mann said. \"Cora is the glue to this whole thing. Cora keeps everybody grounded.\" Mann said Mr. Brown's speech and mannerisms are from a combination of people. \"Grandfathers, uncles, relatives, you know, different friends you see.\" he said. \"I use to go to a nursing home and just look at people, watch -- 'OK, that's how they're doing this.' \" His biggest laughs come from his use -- or abuse -- of the English language which Mann refers to as \"Mr. Brownisms.\" Manipulate becomes \"manipudip,\" while hypnotize transforms to \"hepatitis.\" \"You hear them as I spit them out, and it's just like, 'What was I thinking?' \" Mann said. Mr. Brown's wardrobe, which is always two sizes too small for his protruding belly, is a bright-colored mix of thrift store specials. \"The clothes just kind of happened,\" he said. \"Because, you know, you have that uncle or that relative in your family who just can't let the clothes go?\" Since Mr. Brown originated on the stage -- in Perry productions -- Mann had to adjust to the small screen. \"I'm very animated and so I just had to make sure I toned that down for the screen because I'm so used to making sure that the person in the front row can see as well as the person in the balcony,\" he said. \"To bring that and condense it down for television was a transition for me.\" Camera operators are challenged to keep up with Mann as he moves around the set, sometimes re-writing the script. \"One word can trigger a whole different thing with us, and that's what I love about working with Tyler Perry,\" Mann said. \"He gives you the freedom to go in there and create. If you see something that can make it funnier, he gives you the liberty to go ahead and do it, create it and make it funny.\" Perry directs every episode at his new Atlanta studio on a sound stage next to where he also tapes \"House of Payne.\" Mr. Brown never seems too far from Mr. Mann. In mid-interview, he emerges. \"Oh, he can come out any time,\" Mann, speaking as Brown, said. \"All you got tuh do is say it, and he'll come. Yeap, Mr. Brown is always 'round somewhere. You jes' got tuh belieeeeeve.\" The character is played about 30 years older than Mann, which causes some confusion out of costume and in public, he said. \"What's funny is when people see me out they're like, 'Are you Mr. Brown's son?' No, I'm Mr. Brown,\" he said. \"But that's good for the makeup team.\" Perhaps the most awkward time is when he is on the set, dressed as Mr. Brown, and he wants to show his wife, Tamela Mann, some husbandly affection. \"She is like, 'When you put that makeup on, you are Mr. Brown, you're not my husband.' \" he said. \"So, she doesn't want me kissing on her and stuff. She says 'it's like a dirty old man kissing and hugging on me.' \" You can also see Mr. Brown in \"Tyler Perry's Madea Goes To Jail,\" which hit theaters last month and has been a rousing success at the box office. \"They finally got Madea,\" Mann said. \"She's been to jail a few times, but this time Madea goes to prison -- or as Mr. Brown would say, 'prisnuh.' \"", "50ea08544a01e51a187ac78e8298404450d3584b": "(CNN) -- The son of former Liberian President Charles Taylor Sr. was sentenced Friday to 97 years in prison for charges including torture and conspiracy, according to a federal court in Florida. The U.S.-born son of Charles Taylor Sr., pictured, moved to Liberia when his father became president. U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga sentenced Charles \"Chuckie\" Taylor Jr., 31, in a Friday morning session that lasted four hours, according to a court document. Altonaga cited Taylor's \"sadistic, cruel and atrocious past,\" saying it \"constituted unacceptable, universally condemned torture,\" The Miami Herald reported. \"The lengthy prison term handed down today justly reflects the horror and torture that Taylor Jr. visited upon his victims,\" said Matthew Friedrich, acting assistant attorney general of the criminal division. Taylor, also known as Charles McArthur Emmanuel, was convicted October 30 of torture, conspiracy to commit torture and firearm charges. His case, tried in Miami, was the first brought under a 1994 U.S. law saying those accused of committing torturous acts overseas can be tried in a U.S. federal court, as long as the person is a U.S. national or is present in the United States, regardless of nationality. Calls to Taylor's defense attorneys were not immediately returned. Prosecutors had asked for Taylor to be sentenced to 147 years. Taylor was born in Boston, Massachusetts, but he moved to Liberia when his father was named president. Prosecutors said Taylor became the leader of the Anti-Terrorist Unit and the Liberian National Police while his father was president. The two groups are accused of abducting, torturing and killing people. From 1999 to 2002, Taylor committed torture and allowed others to commit torture, prosecutors said. Taylor and his associated burned victims with molten plastic, lighted cigarettes, candle wax and an iron. Some were severely beaten with firearms, cut and stabbed and shocked with an electric device, prosecutors said in an indictment that superseded the initial indictment from 2006. In the initial indictment, Taylor was charged with one count of torture, one count of conspiracy to torture and one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. The superseding September 2007 indictment -- which incorporated the initial charges -- included five counts of torture, one count of conspiracy to torture, one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime and one count of conspiracy to use a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. The defense had said the U.S. government had little or no evidence to back up its claims. Also Friday, the World Organization for Human Rights USA filed a civil class action suit against Taylor on behalf of a group of people who are said to have been subjected to torture and other human rights abuses by Taylor or his subordinates, according to the organization. The suit seeks declaratory relief and general, compensatory and punitive damages, the organization said in a written statement. \"This civil suit aims to address Defendant Taylor's wrongs on a much greater scale\" than the criminal trial, the organization said. Taylor's father, Charles Taylor Sr., is standing trial in The Hague, Netherlands, on war crimes charges.

A fire broke out late Sunday night on Duval Street in Key West. The fire, which started at about 10:30 p.m. Sunday and was contained by 1 a.m. Monday, wiped out a crepe shop, an art gallery and a sign shop. Two firefighters suffered minor injuries, city spokeswoman Alyson Crean said. The fire department was working Monday to determine the cause of the blaze, Crean said. Singer Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville restaurant and store was one of the businesses initially shut down, halting late-night festivities at the popular watering hole in mid-pour. \"I was hoping to go back in, finish off my shift and clean up, but they wouldn't let us back in,\" said waitress Patricija Hambrook. \"It became bigger than we thought. \"We couldn't close out checks, and the drinks we made were never served.\" Margaritaville's restaurant reopened Monday afternoon, and its adjacent retail store reopened a few hours later, the fire department said. In addition to protecting Margaritaville, firefighters kept flames away from the historic San Carlos theater, although the facility's administrator said that a large broken out window and about 2 inches of water on the floor of the lobby would keep it closed for a few days. Alex Pascual said he anticipated the theater would reopen by Thursday, in time for a concert scheduled for that evening. The San Carlos was founded in 1871 and was the site of Cuban patriot Jose Marti's 1892 speech launching his drive for Cuban independence. Fire officials initially shut down Duval Street to vehicular traffic but allowed pedestrians to stroll the sidewalks. Traffic restrictions prompted some business owners to be concerned about their livelihoods, at least for the short term. Robert Porter, assistant manager of Crazy Shirts, was concerned early Monday \"because there aren't any cars driving through.\" But Banana Republic general manager Darren Paugh said the foot traffic and onlookers curious to see the aftermath of the fire \"should increase business for the day.\" Plus, he said, three cruise ships were in port Monday morning. And Crean indicated life for tourists won't stop in Key West because of the fire. \"We have a lot of spring breakers on vacation and bikers coming from Bike Week in Daytona,\" Crean said. All the concern proved unfounded when officials reopened Duval Street at about 10 a.m. Monday morning. For the owners of the three businesses that took the brunt of the fire, however, it will be some time before it's business as usual. \"It's a big loss for us. And we worked so hard, it's not fair,\" said La Creperie Cafe owner Yolande Findlay in a story published on the Keynoter newspaper's Web site Monday. Findlay, according to the paper's Web site, opened the popular crepe shop with her partner, Sylvie Lenouail, six years ago. Both are from Brittany, France. The American Royal Art gallery, which specialized in entertainment art, and the sign shop Montage were destroyed in the fire.", "27639bd507d10216b2143c2557315e7c65293820": "(CNN)  -- Accused enemy combatant Ali al-Marri was served with an arrest warrant Tuesday and transferred out of U.S. military custody for the first time since 2003, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri was a student at Bradley University in Illinois when he was arrested in 2001. Al-Marri's initial court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday. Defense Secretary Robert Gates released the Qatari man to the U.S. Marshals Service in preparation for the hearing. On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the Obama administration's request to dismiss al-Marri's challenge of the president's unilateral authority to detain him indefinitely and without charges. The high court ruled that al-Marri's case was rendered moot by a decision to indict him on federal conspiracy charges. The court's ruling means there is no resolution of the larger constitutional issue of the president's power to detain people accused of terrorism and other crimes in the United States. The decision by the Obama administration to criminally charge al-Marri after he spent seven years in custody -- more than five years in virtual isolation in a Navy brig in Charleston, South Carolina -- is the latest twist in the ongoing legal saga of the only remaining \"enemy combatant\" held in the United States. Al-Marri had been accused of being an al Qaeda \"sleeper agent,\" but until the indictment had never been charged with a criminal or terrorism-related offense. The 43-year-old man will be sent at some point to Peoria, Illinois, to face a criminal trial. President Obama last month ordered a prompt and thorough review of the \"factual and legal basis\" for the continued detention of al-Marri. He subsequently issued a presidential memorandum ordering Gates to facilitate al-Marri's transfer, saying it was \"in the interest of the United States.\" Since his initial arrest on credit card fraud charges in December 2001, al-Marri -- a legal resident of the United States -- had remained in \"virtual isolation in the brig,\" his attorneys said. They were suing the government to improve his jail conditions and were challenging the constitutionality of his detention. The Pentagon asserts al-Marri had trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan, met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and \"volunteered for a martyr mission,\" according to a government filing with the Supreme Court.", "73c95602213ae6837a71f98aeaad7fd77bda2a7a": "JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Israeli media are buzzing with reports that right-wing nationalist Avigdor Lieberman may become Israel's next foreign minister. Avigdor Lieberman is loathed by ultra-orthodox parties because of his support for a Palestinian state. The appointment of Lieberman, a polarizing figure in Israeli politics, could complicate the stalled peace talks with the Palestinians. It could also further strain relations between Israel and moderate Arab countries. Prime Minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu is still in the process of forming Israel's next government. Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported this week that it is likely that he will select Lieberman as foreign minister. The paper quoted a source close to the negotiations between Netanyahu's Likud Party and Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu. Lieberman would replace outgoing Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, head of the moderate Kadima party, which secured the most number of parliament seats in last month's election -- but not enough to form a coalition government. Netanyahu has been unable to woo moderate parties, including Kadima, into his government. He may be forced to concede some key ministerial posts to Lieberman's party, which would be the second largest faction in the new coalition government behind Likud. Netanyahu has vowed to form a broad-based government, but it is unclear how he can keep that promise since Kadima and the moderate Labor Party have indicated that they plan to form an opposition to a Likud-led government. \"Although Netanyahu has reportedly largely agreed to making Lieberman his foreign minister, he is thought to still be weighing the potential political damage the appointment of the hawkish politicians would do to the image of his government,\" Haaretz reported. The Jerusalem Post, quoting unnamed diplomatic sources, reported that although Israel's ties with western Europe may suffer if Lieberman becomes foreign minister, he may help improve the Jewish state's ties with Russia and eastern Europe. Lieberman is in a peculiar spot on the Israeli political spectrum He is routinely categorized as a right-wing hawk. But as a secularist who supports an independent Palestinian state, he is loathed by Israel's ultra-orthodox parties, including Shas, which holds 11 seats in the Knesset and is another potential member of Netanyahu's coalition. It is unclear how moderate Arab countries, who are still outraged over Israel's recent military operation in Gaza, would react to Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. Egypt, one of only four Muslim countries that have full diplomatic ties with Israel, has been trying to negotiate a broader cease-fire between Israel and Gaza's Hamas leadership. It is unclear whether those indirect negotiations would continue under the new Israeli government. Lieberman has said he is unwilling to directly or indirectly negotiate with Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by Israel for its refusal to recognize Israel and renounce violence against the Jewish state. Lieberman does support \"the creation of a viable Palestinian state,\" which is the bedrock of U.S. policy in the region. He restated that support in a Jewish Week article, written shortly after last month's election. That puts him at odds with Netanyahu, who does not support a two-state solution. However, Lieberman's support of a Palestinian state comes at a high price. He has stated that he would oppose any peace agreement that would divide Jerusalem as a shared capital between Israel and a Palestinian state. Lieberman, who migrated from the former Soviet Union to Israel in 1978, has also called for Israel's boundaries to be redrawn to exclude much of Israel's Arab minority, a move that would strip them of their citizenship. Palestinians with Israeli citizenship make up about 20 percent of the Jewish state's population. Lieberman frequently clashes with Arab members of the Knesset and has called for them to be tried and executed for meeting with leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas. He wants all Knesset members, both Arabs and Jews, to prove their loyalty by swearing allegiance to the Israeli flag and national anthem. Arab Knesset member Ahmed Tibi has warned that Lieberman's rising popularity reflects a dangerous trend. \"We are talking about a pure and obvious fascist phenomena invading the Israeli society,\" Tibi said. \"During the last years, racism became mainstream in the Israeli society.\" Lieberman's supporters credit him with offering clear solutions to Israel's complicated problems. In his article in Jewish Week, he rejected accusations from his critics that his party is racist. \"I stand at the head of the most diverse political party in the Knesset,\" he wrote, noting that his party's Knesset members have included four women, three people with disabilities, a Jewish convert and a Zionist. \"I find it a bit rich to be called a bigot.\" He said that he \"look[s] forward to working with President Obama\" since \"U.S.-Israel relations are as strong as ever, and that our shared values and interests make our friendship unshakable.\" Yossi Klein Halevy of the Adelson Institute of Strategic Studies said Lieberman is tapping into the dark side of Israelis' concerns about security, particularly as militants in Gaza continue to routinely fire rockets on southern Israel . \"Lieberman is riding an ugly wave of resentment among many Jewish Israelis toward the Arab-Israeli minority,\" he said. Ynetnews.com political correspondent Attila Somfalvi recently wrote that Lieberman has become \"the leader of those who lost any hope or faith in the possibility of securing peace or engaging in talks with the Arabs.\" \"The war in Gaza indeed restored the public's sense of security and lowered the anxiety level, yet Lieberman is perceived as the man who will know how to do what needs to be done so that no more missiles land around here,\" she wrote.", "4c540db41b12235c073d4da0c6b0e9c80c1c1bbe": "(CNN) -- Simon Cowell may not recognize \"American Idol\" alumna Mandisa the next time he sees her. Mandisa, who appeared on season five of \"American Idol,\" has lost more than 75 pounds. The woman about whom the acerbic \"American Idol\" judge once said, \"We're going to have to get a bigger stage,\" has lost 75 pounds -- and hopes to lose 100 or more. Though she has long forgiven Cowell for his snippy comments during season five about her weight, she said she still wants to lose more in part because he is a father figure for her. The last time he saw her was last season when she had lost a few pounds. He raved about how nice she looked then. \"He was very encouraging and saying how proud he was of me,\" she said. \"It's sort of like your dad who you really want to please. I want to please him and to show him that I am doing well.\" Mandisa, whose full name is Mandisa Hundley, said that her faith in God has guided her new lifestyle. \"It's more than the physical and more than what I am eating. It's a spiritual change,\" she said. \"I've had to not turn to food for comfort and validation anymore, and that is a complete mind change. Because my entire life, that is what I have done.\" She named her new album, \"Freedom,\" due out March 24, after the feeling she has gotten breaking what she calls her food addiction. It follows a successful debut CD, \"True Beauty,\" of which Entertainment Weekly said, \"Plus-size powerhouse Mandisa ... realizes her considerable pipes and self-righteousness are best suited to Christian pop.\" It sold more than 160,000 copies. The new album is full of catchy Christian pop tunes such as \"My Deliverer,\" \"Dance Dance Dance\" and \"Freedom Song,\" and power ballads such as \"Not Guilty.\" The song that is nearest to her heart is \"You Wouldn't Cry,\" a tune based on a fan whom Mandisa met and corresponded with who lost her unborn child. Mandisa said that when she went to put together a CD of songs to help comfort her friend, she couldn't find anything from the child's point of view. \"I wanted to write a song about what Andrew would say to his mom about the fact that he's in heaven,\" Mandisa said. \"For people who have faced the situation where a loved one had gone to be with the Lord, I think the song will mean a lot to them.\" She called \"My Deliverer\" her personal testimony. In the chorus she sings: . My deliverer, you rescued me from all that held me captive . My deliverer, you set me free . Now I'm alive and I can live . The song as a first single is \"perfect, because it's a kind of been my story over these past few months\" of her weight loss. When CNN.com first spoke to Mandisa in January, she was singing on a cruise ship. (Yes, Simon, a cruise ship.) \"I think that this is a cruise ship like no other,\" she said of the K-Love Family and Friends cruise, a gathering of Christian music bands and their fans. She beamed with pride then as she described her new exercise regimen and diet. The most difficult part has been to retrain her mind to turn to God instead of turning to food, she said. She also talked about her time on the show that brought her to America's attention. \"American Idol's\" producers gave the fifth-season contestants a speech about being themselves, saying to not pretend to be anybody other than who you are, she said. \"I don't know that they realized that I was as vocal about my faith as I am,\" she said. She was caught in controversy when an article in The Advocate questioned whether she was a proponent of the \"ex-gay\" movement. She thinks her critics were too focused on her statements about not agreeing with what she calls \"the lifestyle\" and missed her message of love for everyone. \"I think that we are called to love people that are different from us and that don't agree with the things we agree with,\" she said. She still watches \"American Idol\" faithfully, and like many other people tuning in each week, is a fan of Danny Gokey, a 28-year-old widower from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She said this week that he is the clear favorite but also likes 23-year-old Matt Giraud from Kalamazoo, Michigan (\"I love his voice\") and Lil Rounds, a mother of three from Memphis, Tennessee (\"I think she's incredible as well\"). \"But I am still rooting for Danny to win,\" she said. After being booted from \"Idol,\" many observers thought that Mandisa had a good chance of becoming a successful R&B artist. She said she considered that path; it was all she wanted to be when she was growing up. But she felt a call to sing Christian music. \"Christian music is the music that comes the most naturally for me,\" she said. The pop world is so big, and it has been easier for \"Idol\" alums who have pursued careers in country or Christian music, she said. She said she also is pretty passionate about exercising. \"There's a feeling you get after you exercise; it's just unexplainable,\" she said. \"It makes you know that you have done the right thing for your body.\" She works out with a trainer three to five times a week, mixing cardio with muscle-building exercises. \"This is a lifestyle for me.

A sophomore at the University of Illinois, Vonck will travel to San Juan, Texas, in a group of 13 students to volunteer with La Union del Pueblo Entero, an organization that helps strengthen the communities and lives of farm workers and their families. \"Learning about different cultures is very important to me,\" Vonck said. \"I like to engage in different areas of life that I don't really understand.\" Every year, more and more college students, like Vonck, are choosing to spend their valuable time off from school participating in \"alternative spring break\" programs -- community service-based opportunities dealing with the most pressing issues of the day, including hunger and homelessness, disaster relief and global warming. \"If you can name a social issue, then students are doing trips around it,\" said Jill Piacitelli, executive director of Break Away, an organization that trains and helps colleges across the United States promote alternative break programs. For the past six years, these programs have been growing in popularity among college students. Break Away estimated that this year, nearly 65,000 students will participate in its alternative break programs, an 11 percent increase from 2008. \"It's a student-led social movement. ... This is a group that very much wants to be involved in the world around them,\" Piacitelli said of the volunteers. \"They're solution-oriented. They want to innovate and lead and involve their peers.\" The average domestic trip costs around $250 or $300, Piacitelli said, which includes \"housing, travel, social activities, food and often a donation to the community.\" Many university programs offer financial aid and the option to raise money to help pay for trips. \"It is rare that anyone who wants to go on a trip cannot go,\" Piacitelli said. The affordability is part of the reason why so many students return for second or third trips. Nikunj Shah, a graduate of Arcadia University, has taken several alternative spring break trips volunteering in the United States and Mexico. This year, he will be traveling as an alumnus to Jean Lafitte, Louisiana, a city that has been largely ignored by disaster relief efforts in the wake of hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita. \"I've always had an interest in helping people. I've always been really involved in community service,\" Shah said. \"So I saw this as an opportunity to go places I haven't been before, to get a feel for different cultures and to help people there that truly need help.\" In an effort to expand their alternative spring break options, universities across the United States partner with humanitarian organizations like the United Way of America. Randy Punley, director of corporate and media partnerships at the United Way, oversees the organization's Alternative Spring Break programs. After Hurricane Katrina, the United Way partnered with MTV to engage young people in the response effort. \"We knew there was an interest and a passion in young people for the work we were trying to achieve,\" Punley said. Since then, the United Way has evolved and expanded, establishing chapters on college campuses. The organization has also developed an Alternative Spring Break Social Media Challenge, encouraging young people to be active in their communities and use social media Web sites, like Facebook or Twitter, to involve other people. \"Whether it started with the first Gulf War, punctuated by the September 11 attacks and Katrina and the economic meltdown, young people have a very different perspective about what's going on in the world,\" Punley said. At the end of the weeklong trip, most students say it was the best week of their lives, Punley said. The increasing interest in these programs, Punley believes, speaks volumes about the attitudes of Generation Y, a group of people who are eager to make an impact on the world around them. \"It's such a difference from going home and not really feeling accomplished to going on these trips and meeting new people,\" Vonck said. \"You get experiences that you wouldn't get sitting on the couch watching TV for a week.\" Piacitelli said these programs encourage young people to continue serving their communities and those in need. \"The students are the main benefactors of what goes on,\" Piacitelli said. \"It changes their consciousness. They get really interested in social issues ... They see themselves as active citizens, and helping the community becomes a priority.\" Like Vonck and Shah, University of Illinois senior Adriana Collazo has a passion for community service. During her spring break last year, Collazo traveled to the Bronx in New York to volunteer at a homeless shelter. She stayed at a hostel with other volunteers and helped serve food and organize clothing drives. \"I never really had all that money to go off and do the whole Cancun, Mexico, spring break, and I didn't really want to, because I think that's throwing away money,\" Collazo said. \"When you can give back, it's selfish.\" The trip to the Bronx was a personal one for Collazo who, at the age of 6, experienced poverty firsthand when her family became homeless. \"My family's better now, and I want to give back,\" Collazo said. \"I think a lot of students have realized that they can do better things with their time. ... It humbles you.\"", "bf74899b892175a68325fa98013050c70374ab92": "(CNN) -- Pharmaceuticals giants Merck and Schering-Plough are planning to merge their operations under the name Merck in a deal worth $41.1 billion.

No one submitted the minimum $3.2 million bid for former Falcon Michael Vick's Atlanta-area mansion. The multimillion-dollar home in Duluth was on the auction block Tuesday, but just three real estate agents showed up -- and one of them, Lance Hempen of Funari Realty, was a listing agent who had no clients interested in the property. No one offered a bid, so the auction ended before it began. The auction required a minimum bid of $3.2 million, with a deposit of $160,000. Vick, 28, is serving a 23-month sentence after pleading guilty in August 2007 to a federal conspiracy charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia. He is expected to be released early, possibly in May, and to serve the final two months or so of his sentence under home confinement, most likely in Virginia. No dogfights occurred in Duluth, 40 miles northeast of Atlanta. The home, in the upscale Sugarloaf Country Club community, has been on the market for more than a year. It has eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a four-car garage and a movie theater, among other deluxe features. Narender Reddy of Metro Brokers/GMAC Real Estate said his client offered $3.2 million for the home two months ago, but the auction organizers said they wanted to see whether someone would offer more. Reddy said his client withdrew the bid but remains interested. \"Why would I let them use my offer as a benchmark?\" Reddy asked. \"I wanted to see who was going to bid and what were they going to offer.\" He will advise his client to offer less money now, Reddy said. Seema Jain of Virtual Properties Realty also was on hand. She said that she has interested buyers but that they didn't want to bid if there was no competition. The next step is to be determined by the bankruptcy judge in Virginia who ordered the sale. Reddy said the price is too high for today's economy. \"It is the economy that is dictating the price of the houses, and I'm sure most of the people still think $3.2 million ... is higher than what the market can fetch,\" he said. Jain said no one seems turned off by Vick's reputation. \"Nobody cares about who owns it. It's just the product and the location,\" she said. Reddy said the home is \"well-built, has a lake view and an excellent floor plan.\" CNN's Amanda Moyer and Deb Krajnak contributed to this report.", "6a23daaeae81f208667e47dbd8eec0e56802cb42": "KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Up to 30,000 additional U.S. troops could be sent to Afghanistan next year, military officials said Saturday. Helicopters are the main transportation of the U.S. military in Afghanistan, with its high mountain terrain. Roughly 31,000 U.S. troops currently are in Afghanistan. Of the additional troops, 20,000 will comprise four ground/maneuvering brigades, said Col. Gregory Julian, spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. That number is consistent with what Gen. David McKiernan, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, called for in October, he said. The additional 10,000 likely refers to support personnel, Julian said. McKiernan requested the additional 20,000 troops be sent to fight the increasing violence by the resurgent Taliban forces in the southern and eastern parts of the country. On Friday, military officials said Defense Secretary Robert Gates signed a deployment order to move an additional 3,000 troops to Afghanistan next year. Those troops will be part of a combat aviation brigade, the latest approved by Gates for the expected buildup of U.S. troops in the country in 2009. The brigade will send a number of much-needed helicopters to the region. Helicopters are the main mode of transportation for the U.S. military in Afghanistan, where high mountain roads and passes make it difficult for large transport vehicles to move troops and supplies. The additional troops would nearly double the level of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Troop levels are likely to be maintained at this increased level for three to four years, Julian said Saturday, as U.S. forces continue to try to \"clear and hold\" more parts of Afghanistan from insurgents and militants and train Afghan military and police to be self-sufficient.", "cdf534312f1c63bcb2bfd34c4a925155830dcb15": "In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents and producers share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. CNN's Soledad O'Brien and Stan Wilson visited San Quentin for \"Black in America: The Black Man\" which rebroadcasts tonight at 8 p.m. ET. \"I want to have everything that an average American would want,\" said Chris Shurn who served time in prison. OAKLAND, California (CNN) -- Chris Shurn walked out of San Quentin Prison in June after serving four years of hard time for possession of crack cocaine and a weapon charge. He joined at least 3,000 men paroled each year in Oakland, California, where the recidivism rate is more than 50 percent. When our documentary team first met Shurn inside San Quentin in 2008, he considered himself one of the lucky ones. At 21, he entered prison with a fourth-grade education, but left with a GED certificate and was only a few semesters short of earning an associate degree. Shurn told us there were few role models around him as a kid. He said his father left home before he entered the first grade, his mother was a crack addict and he was surrounded by a lot of violence. Ironically, San Quentin is where Shurn met the kind of role models he said he needed to break the cycle of incarceration. His hard work and determination to change caught the eye of Everett Highbaugh, who runs a program called Project Choice. Twice a week, Highbaugh goes into San Quentin with the goal of transforming men like Shurn from drug entrepreneurs to business entrepreneurs. Upon his release, Shurn replaced his dreadlocks and prison uniform with casual attire and a neatly manicured haircut. He said he felt relieved after the harsh conditions of prison life, but said he struggles every day in his Oakland neighborhood to resist the temptations of making easy money by selling crack cocaine. \"I want to have a family. I want to own a house. I want to have everything that an average American would want; a good-paying job, a career,\" he said. But the odds are against him. Nearly 1 million black men are behind bars, an especially crippling blow to black communities, where one in three black men will have a prison record in their lifetimes. They leave behind communities filled with fear, broken families and a generation of vulnerable children. After Shurn left San Quentin, Highbaugh was in contact with him twice a week and helped him land a part-time job at Goodwill Industries. At Goodwill, Shurn spent 30 hours a week in a labor-intensive job, stacking goods and preparing them for shipment. \"I remember reading a lot of these very same books in prison,\" said Shurn as he was busy working. He was grateful to have a job, but frustrated because it paid so little, $7 an hour. That job lasted only a few months. When we caught up with him in January, he had been unemployed for a while. As he sat in Oakland's Oracle Arena watching the inauguration of President Barack Obama, he wondered how he was going to help support his girlfriend and her daughter and earn enough tuition money to continue working toward his degree. Shurn has moved a few times, but is still hoping for success, still fighting against long odds, particularly in a severely debilitated job market. He's hopeful that his hard work and the skills he learned through Project Choice will be a much better alternative than making easy money on the street -- a certain pathway back to prison. \"Every day of my life, with or without work, I feel vulnerable,\" said Shurn. \"Instead of waking up every day and going to a 9-to-5; I used to wake up and go outside and sell some drugs and have my money for a whole week.\" \"It crosses my mind, but I got to a point where I'm disciplined and don't need to venture into it.\" A few weeks ago, Shurn was hired as a courier for a local printing business. The job pays $9 per hour; $2 more than his previous job. He says the new job won't be enough to pay all the bills, but his goal is to build a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 so future employers will take a chance on an ex-convict who's trying to recover from a mistake that cost him four years of his life.", "f39e76a387f7749755a0fd88225f200cd353511b": "MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russian space officials say the crew of the Soyuz space ship is resting after a rough ride back to Earth. A South Korean bioengineer was one of three people on board the Soyuz capsule. The craft carrying South Korea's first astronaut landed in northern Kazakhstan on Saturday, 260 miles (418 kilometers) off its mark, they said. Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin said the condition of the crew -- South Korean bioengineer Yi So-yeon, American astronaut Peggy Whitson and Russian flight engineer Yuri Malenchenko -- was satisfactory, though the three had been subjected to severe G-forces during the re-entry. Search helicopters took 25 minutes to find the capsule and determine that the crew was unharmed. Officials said the craft followed a very steep trajectory that subjects the crew to gravitational forces of up to 10 times those on Earth. Interfax reported that the spacecraft's landing was rough. This is not the first time a spacecraft veered from its planned trajectory during landing. In October, the Soyuz capsule landed 70 kilometers from the planned area because of a damaged control cable.

Bayern Munich players react to the crowd after their staggering 12-1 aggregate victory over Sporting. Leading 5-0 from the first leg, a double from Lukas Podolski and Anderson Polga's own goal put them 3-0 up on the night within 40 minutes before Joao Moutinho pulled one back in stunning fashion. It was the briefest respite for Sporting, though, Bastian Schweinsteiger hitting an immediate reply, before Mark van Bommel, Miroslav Klose (pen) and Thomas Muller netted in the second half for a 7-1 triumph on the night. The result was a record aggregate winning margin for a post-group stage Champions League game, surpassing Lyon's 10-2 demolition of Werder Bremen in 2005. The scoring began in the eighth minute, Podolski combining well with Ze Roberto on the edge of the box after Bayern took advantage of a poor defensive clearance before hammering home from the edge of the box. Bayern were rampant and the second finally came after 34 minutes when a long kick from the Bayern keeper Jorg Butt sailed through to the edge of the Sporting area. It should have been simple for the visiting defense, but a horrible mix-up between Polga and and Patricio allowed Podolski to flick the ball over his head and into the empty net. Polga's night got even worse 39 later when he scored an own goal, volleying Schweinsteiger's cross into his own net. There was a brief hiatus in Sporting's embarrassment when Moutinho's classy strike arrowed into the far left corner three minutes before the break to reduce the arrears. But barely a minute later, Christian Lell pulled the ball back for Schweinsteiger to sweep home, making it 9-1 on aggregate. Bayern coach Jurgen Klinsmann made two changes at half-time, bringing on Jose Sosa and Breno for Ze Roberto and Lucio as the pace dropped. A fifth did arrive, though, in the 74th minute, substitute Muller's cross headed across goal by Klose for Van Bommel to control and fire home. And Klose continued to pile on the woe for Sporting in the 82nd minute, picking himself up from a foul by Pedro Silva to convert the subsequent penalty. Teenager Muller, making his Champions League debut, rounded things off in the final minute, poking home from Sosa's corner.", "1587bb9c4aba6ee43af23cd10a6c23b895dade33": "GOLDEN, Colorado (CNN) -- Sometimes the best way to roll with the punches is to roll the dice. Jerry Goldsmith was one of hundreds of people who turned out this week to apply for a casino job. That's Jerry Goldsmith's attitude. The Colorado man lost his engineering job of 29 years -- and the six-figure salary that went with it -- and is now applying for a casino job dealing craps, blackjack, roulette and poker. \"I was angry. I think everyone gets angry,\" says Goldsmith, 60, recalling his New Year's Day firing. \"It's 'Why me?' But after a while I just learned: One door closed, but many more just opened. \"I just need to find the right one to go into.\" Goldsmith was one of 750 people who showed up  Wednesday to apply for casino dealer jobs near Denver. Another 550 applied on Thursday. The applicants were going after 90 spots in dealer school. Earlier on Wednesday, Goldsmith had interviewed for a job as a cable TV installer. They were his first job interviews since losing his job. He says that, at first, he spent a lot of time on the Internet looking for work. He also contacted executive headhunters but was unable to find any leads in the engineering field. So he decided to expand his search into other areas. Goldsmith says he nailed the casino job interview and thinks he would make a great dealer. \"When you've been working hard all your life, quitting is just not an option, so I'll take on any opportunity I can,\" he says, adding with a laugh: \"Hopefully there will be some exchange of gratuity in the business so I make something.\" In a November referendum, Colorado voters approved a measure to expand betting limits at casinos in Colorado from $5 to $100 and to add the games of roulette and craps. The new rules will also allow the casinos to stay open 24 hours a day. They currently close at 2 a.m. and open at 8 a.m. The state hopes to benefit from the increased tax dollars, a portion of which will help fund community colleges, but before the first new tax dollar goes into state coffers, the casinos need to staff up. \"Twenty-four-hour gaming adds a whole extra shift every day, seven days a week. You're adding an extra shift in every department of the casino,\" says Jef Bauer, who runs three casinos in Black Hawk, Colorado, for Golden Gaming: the Golden Mardi Gras, Golden Gates and Golden Gulch. \"We're looking to hire initially about 90 people into our dealer school, which we're offering free to learn how to deal craps, roulette and blackjack.\" Golden Gaming currently employs about 400 people in Black Hawk and anticipates adding another 100 by July 2, when the new rules go into effect. Black Hawk is a former mining town tucked into the Rocky Mountains about 35 miles from Denver. Black Hawk and its next-door neighbor, Central City, became casino towns in the 1990s. For years the towns flourished, but Bauer says times are tough now. \"We have just been through 12 months of declines in gaming revenues and head counts,\" he says, adding that he hopes the increased bet limits, new games and extended hours will bring the gamblers back to the tables. Before the hiring event even started, more than 100 people were lined up, waiting for an interview outside of a bar in Golden, Colorado. The would-be croupiers filed in, filled out applications and were assigned a number. They were photographed and then sat down for a 3-minute job interview. No experience was necessary for the casino jobs. Applicants who make the grade will attend a casino-run, part-time dealer school for three months, where they will learn the complicated games and qualify for a Colorado gaming license. The jobs pay between $40,000 and $80,000 a year, depending on tips. So who would make a good dealer? \"Mainly what we're looking at is personality and an ability to entertain, and intelligence that can be proven in dealer school,\" says Bauer. \"Most will probably never have dealt cards before.\" That seems like just the ticket to Andrea Pitts, whose only casino experience has been on the other side of the table. \"I'm a high roller,\" she says with a laugh. \"I've never dealt cards before, but I love to play blackjack and I'm pretty good at it.\" Pitts, 41, spent 12 years working in the trucking industry. But the bad economy has taken its toll, and now she has been forced to look for any kind of work. Like most of the other casino applicants, she never pictured herself dealing cards. But she says she is ready for the change of pace. \"You have to keep yourself motivated. It would be easy to sit at home and feel sorry for yourself, but that's not going to get you anywhere,\" she says. \"I'm not afraid to take challenges -- that's what life is all about.\" Casinos are big business. According to the American Gaming Association, some 360,000 people work in 467 commercial casinos across the country, accounting for $13.8 billion in wages including benefits and tips. The industry paid $5.78 billion in gaming taxes in 2007. Alan Meister, an economist and the author of \"Indian Gaming Industry Report,\" says there were 346,000 people directly employed by 423 Indian gaming casinos in 2007. State governments often look to casinos as a quick source of tax income in difficult economic times.

Especially when they fly on a C-130 Hercules military plane. Almost 400 lost Magellanic penguins march back to the sea after being rescued by animal-welfare groups. In Brazil, 373 young Magellanic penguins were rescued, rehabilitated and released last weekend after their search for food left them stranded, hundreds of miles from their usual feeding grounds. Animal-welfare activists loaded the birds onto a Brazilian air force cargo plane and flew them 1,550 miles to the country's southern coast, where a crowd of onlookers celebrated as the penguins marched back into the sea. \"We are overjoyed to see these penguins waddle back to the ocean and have a second chance at life,\" said veterinarian Dr. Valeria Ruoppolo of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the group that oversaw the rescue.  See photo gallery of rescued penguins \u00bb . Magellanic penguins are warm-weather birds that breed in large colonies in southern Argentina and Chile. The young animals then migrate north between March and September, following their favorite fish, the anchovy. The birds are named after Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who first saw them in 1519. But changes in currents and water temperature apparently confused the juvenile birds, who strayed too far north to the warm beaches of Salvador, Brazil, 870 miles north of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  Watch the penguins march into the sea \u00bb . Starting in mid-July, in the northeastern Brazilian state of Bah\u00eda, \"It was just about raining penguins,\" Ruoppolo said. \"There was not much of a food supply. The birds were stranded and emaciated. They had lost all their muscles and body condition.\" While occasionally a few birds show up so far north, the unusual sight of hundreds of wayward penguins posed a challenge for animal conservation groups. \"We had to learn how to work with them,\" said Carlos Garcia, a spokesman for IBAMA, the Brazilian Institute for Environment and Renewable Resources. \"Fewer than 20 penguins usually wash ashore, but with such a large number, we had to really understand their biology and learn how to treat them.\" The Instituto Mam\u00edferos Aqu\u00e1ticos (Institute for Aquatic Mammals) also fed and cared for the hungry and disoriented birds. Ruoppolo, who is also the emergency relief officer for IFAW, has a lot of experience saving penguins and other animals injured in oil spills. Last week she worked with conservation groups and volunteers to save as many of the birds as possible. \"We showed them how to stabilize the animals, to feed them and give them proper care,\" she said. Healthy Magellanic penguins grow to about 27 inches tall and weigh about 9 pounds. Ruoppolo said IBAMA -- the government's environmental authority -- and the Brazilian military were supportive throughout the unusual relocation mission. On Friday, the penguins were loaded into special crates and put onto the plane for the journey to Pelotas, in southern Brazil. After their first-ever flight, the birds went on a truck ride to the Center for Recovery of Marine Animals, where they rested for 24 hours. The birds released at Cassino Beach the next day had to meet very specific health criteria, said Ruoppolo. \"Their feathers had to be waterproof, their overall body condition had to be good, their lungs healthy, and they had to be able to catch food,\" she said. The youngsters had some adult supervision for their return to the wild. They were released with a small group of adult penguins that had been nursed back to health after surviving an oil spill. Scientists expect the older birds will help guide the little ones to nearby feeding grounds. Some penguins are still being cared for, both in the north and south of Brazil. The newly released birds have bands on their flippers so scientists can follow their progress and learn more about their migratory habits. Of more than 1,600 penguins that washed ashore in northern Brazil, about half are still alive. That is a fairly good outcome, given the fragile status of young birds on their first migration, said Ruoppolo. \"For all species you have animals that die within the first year,\" she said. And without quick human intervention, the consequences would have been much worse. At this point there is no way to know exactly why the animals became stranded. While the Magellanic penguin population is not in jeopardy because of this one event, Ruoppolo said there are other threats, primarily from overfishing.

Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Continental Airlines, and US Airways received an overall grade of \"F\" on the air travel consumer report card. FlyersRights.org, in issuing what it calls an air travel consumer report card, said there were more than 1,200 tarmac strandings -- in which passengers are locked in planes on the runways -- in 2008. Delta Air Lines had the greatest number of tarmac delays longer than three hours. Southwest Airlines was rated the best for handling delays by letting customers get off delayed planes, as well as providing food, water and other items. The longest delay the organization found was a January 2008 Delta flight from Atlanta, Georgia, to Florida, in which passengers waited on the tarmac for more than 10 hours without food and water. \"Too many Americans have been locked inside sealed airplanes, trapped in tubes on the tarmac, for three hours or more,\" said FlyersRights.org Executive Director Kate Hanni. \"It's time for Congress to give airline passengers the legal right to get off planes stuck on the ground for three hours or more.\" Hanni -- who has been lobbying for an airline passengers' bill of rights -- also said America's economic situation has exacerbated the problems consumers face on the airlines because of layoffs. \"Airlines are trying to maintain or increase their profit margins,\" she said. \"They have decreased all of their goods and services related to flying.\" She added that a timely flight is \"not just a matter of passenger convenience, it's a matter of public safety.\" \"I wonder if heroic Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger and his crew could have performed as they did after seven, nine or even 12 hours on the tarmac?\" Hanni asked, making a reference to the US Airways crew that made an emergency landing in New York's Hudson River in January. Hanni started her organization after she was stranded on the tarmac on an American Airlines flight in Austin, Texas, for more than nine hours in December 2006. Mark Mogel, the group's research director, said FlyersRights.org has about 24,000 members, many of whom donate money, services and lobbying help. The report card is based on government statistics, press reports, airline Web site data, reports on the group's hotline, and eyewitness accounts from January to December of 2008. It surveyed 17 airlines for various kinds of tarmac delays, their menu and contracts of carriage and customer service commitments and issued grades for these separate factors and an overall grade. As for the menu, Mogel specified that the menu grade is based on quantity, not quality. The survey was looking to see whether there would be food on board during a tarmac delay. Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Continental Airlines, and US Airways received an overall grade of \"F\" and American Airlines received an overall grade of \"D.\" United Airlines, Airtran and American Eagle got a \"C.\" Alaska Airlines, Northwest Airlines and Frontier Airlines got a \"B,\" and Southwest received an \"A.\" Five other airlines -- Atlantic Southeast, Comair, ExpressJet, Mesa and Pinnacle -- didn't get an overall grade because some categories couldn't be completed. \"The fact that some airlines have received A's and B's and others D's and F's on this report card also shows that providing decent customer service and avoidance of strandings is both achievable and should not place an undue burden on the airline industry or lead to higher ticket prices,\" the report's executive summary said.

Watchmaker Jonathan Dillon was repairing Lincoln's watch in April 1861 when he heard about the attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, and wrote a short message on the metal inside the watch, the Smithsonian said. There it remained, unseen for almost 150 years, it said. In a 1906 interview with The New York Times, Dillon reported that as soon as he heard the news about the first shots of the Civil War, he unscrewed the dial of the watch and wrote on the metal, \"The first gun is fired. Slavery is dead. Thank God we have a President who at least will try.\" The actual message that the museum found differs from the watchmaker's recollection. It says, \"Jonathan Dillon, April 13-1861, Fort Sumpter [sic] was attacked by the rebels on the above date J Dillon, April 13-1861, Washington, thank God we have a government, Jonth Dillon.\" According to the Smithsonian, it was not unusual for professional watchmakers to record their work inside a watch. \"Lincoln never knew of the message he carried in his pocket,\" said Brent D. Glass, director of the National Museum of American History. The museum decided to open the watch after being contacted by the watchmaker's great-great-grandson, Doug Stiles, who had heard about the message Dillon said he had inscribed and wanted to see if it was really there.", "e281e8d1d941e5fe23310ff59a6c9debee77ad76": "SAMSON, Alabama (CNN)  -- As the crime scene tape starts to come down in this small Southern town, the residents are leaning on one another for comfort and the strength to move on. The shooter, Michael McLedon, killed his mother before killing others. First Baptist Church, a few feet from the neighborhood where Michael McLendon, 28, opened fire Tuesday, welcomed members of this close community Wednesday night for a prayer service. \"It's what community is about, isn't it? Crying together. Holding each other,\" a pastor said. It's hard for many to believe the shooting rampage could happen in this town of about 2,100 people. Authorities said McLendon went to three towns, slaying 10 people. He started in his hometown of Kinston, killing his mother, before moving on to open fire in Samson and finally Geneva. McLendon was once a police officer in Samson, the small town hit hardest by the deadliest crime in Alabama history, authorities said. His nearly hourlong assault ended at the Reliable Metal Products plant in the last town, 24 miles from where it began and where police said McLendon engaged in a shootout before killing himself inside the building. In the aftermath of the rampage, among those seeking comfort at First Baptist Church was Josh Mathews. He was driving down the street around the time of the shootings. \"Could've been anyone -- just missed the gunfire, could've been any of us,\" Mathews said.

A Zimbabwean policeman patrols outside the entrance of Mutare Magistrates court. The order to release the politician had been suspended when state lawyers appealed the HIgh Court decision. Trust Maanda, a lawyer in Mutare city about 300 kilometers (186 miles) east of Harare, told CNN by phone that magistrate Livingstone Chipadze had been arrested. \"He is in police custody. The police are saying he ordered the release of Roy Bennett in compliance with the High Court ruling,\" said Maanda. Bennett is the choice of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) for deputy agriculture minister under the power-sharing government formed last month. On Wednesday, Chipadze ordered Bennett be released from a prison in Mutare as had been ruled by the High Court last week. However, that order, which required Bennett to post $2,000 as bail, was suspended after the state filed an appeal with Zimbabwe's Supreme Court. \"I can confirm the arrest, but I will be in position to tell you the charge he will face later,\" said a police official in Mutare over the phone. \"He is likely to go to court on Saturday or Monday. But most magistrates here [in Mutare] have gone on strike over his arrest.\" Chipadze joins Bennett in prison in Mutare. Bennett was arrested on February 13 and is facing charges of possessing arms for the purposes of banditry, terrorism and sabotage. The continued detention of Bennett, an ally of MDC leader and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, is seen by many as a crack in the foundation of the coalition Tsvangirai formed with President Robert Mugabe. Meanwhile, a Zimbabwe High Court judge Friday ordered the immediate release of three human rights activists in state \"safe custody\" to testify against human rights activist Jestina Mukoko, who is facing charges of plotting to topple Mugabe. Opposition MDC activists Fannie Tembo, Lloyd Tarumbwa and Terry Musona have been missing since October last year after they were abducted from their homes under the cover of darkness. Lawyers Chris Mhike and Innocent Chagonda took the state to the High Court in an attempt to win the release the trio. But the state represented by Nelson Mutsonziwa had opposed the application, saying the three would be state witnesses when the trial of Mukoko starts. The MDC lawyers then successfully argued that the three were bread winners for their families and the state had not provided their families with assistance while they are in custody. Delivering the judgment, Justice Ben Hlatswayo said, \"I order the immediate release of Fannie Tembo, Lloyd Tarumbwa and Terry Musona from police custody or the custody of any other state agent. This order stands enforceable notwithstanding the noting or filing of an appeal.\" Relatives of the three who were milling around the High Court could not hide their joy after Mhike told them of Hlatswayo's ruling.", "8d417a60238936ce5802e68a8bba2f010615f84b": "(CNN) -- A man went over Niagara Falls and survived Wednesday afternoon, one of the few people to ever survive the plunge unprotected, authorities said. It is unclear whether the man chose not to aid in his rescue or was physically unable to do so, officials say. The man was seen entering the icy water just above Horseshoe Falls, on the Canadian side, and apparently jumped in about 2:15 p.m, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Fire Chief Lee Smith said. Smith said the unidentified man was in the near-freezing water for \"40-plus\" minutes before he was rescued by Niagara Parks Police and Niagara Falls firefighter Todd Brunning. Brunning, who was tethered to shore, swam about 60 meters (nearly 200 feet) into the river and was able to get hold of the man and bring him to shore. Niagara Parks Police initially used a helicopter from a private company, Niagara Falls Helicopters, to attempt a rescue of the man. When that failed, they used the wind from the chopper's rotors to push the man closer to shore, Smith said.  Watch chopper hover over man in icy water \u00bb .

Grant's family-owned album showing President Abraham Lincoln in front of the White House could be one of the last photos taken of the 16th president before he was assassinated in 1865. A photo found in Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's family album is verified to contain an image of Abraham Lincoln. Grant's great-great grandson Ulysses S. Grant VI had seen the previously unpublished image in the general's personal photo album, but didn't think much of it until he scrutinized it earlier this year. \"I started to think that it might be the White House,\" said Grant, a construction business owner from Springfield, Missouri. \"Then I started to look at the height difference between the people in the photo.\" Thinking that the towering individual commanding the attention of the other people in the image could be Lincoln -- who stood 6-foot-4 and is the nation's tallest president -- Grant called Keya Morgan, a renowned collector and scholar of Lincoln and Gen. Grant photographs, to see whether his suspicions could be verified. Morgan, who owns the world's largest collection of Lincoln artifacts and original photographs, persuaded Grant to take the small photo out of the album to see whether any clues could be found on the back -- particularly the name of the photographer. \"If you don't know who the photographer is, it's like not knowing who your father and mother are,\" Morgan said. Sure enough, the seal of photographer Henry F. Warren appeared on the back, along with an inscription: \"Lincoln in front of the White House,\" dated 1865. Grant recognized the handwriting as that of his great-grandfather and Gen. Grant's youngest son, Jesse Grant. Those indicators, along with a revenue stamp used from 1864-66 to raise money during the Civil War, helped convince Morgan that the photograph could be the well-documented missing photo from Lincoln's last \"sitting.\"  Watch how photograph was verified \u00bb . According to Morgan -- who cites Lincoln's secretaries John Hay and John Nicolay -- Warren took the last three photographs of Lincoln on March 6, 1865, just two days after his second inauguration. Morgan says Warren was desperate to take pictures of Lincoln, so he staged the first act of paparazzi photography. According to Morgan, Warren first took photos of the president's son Tad on his pony. The following day, Warren gave the pictures to Tad and told him to summon his father. Morgan says that Warren was already set up to take the photo outside the White House, and that Lincoln gave him access afterward to take two more portraits on the White House balcony. Will Stapp, founding curator of the National Portrait Gallery's photography department and a professional photograph appraiser, agrees with Morgan's assessment of the long-lost image. \"The figure itself, the physique -- in looking at it under a magnifying glass, I can see the shape of his beard; I can see the hairline,\" Stapp told CNN. \"It's similar to the impression you get from other photos taken of [Lincoln] from the same distance, like at the Gettysburg Address and his inauguration.\" Stapp and Morgan also say it appears that Lincoln is wearing the same clothes in the outdoor photo as he wore for the portraits taken the same day. As one of only 130 photographs of Lincoln, it is an extraordinary find not only because of its proximity to Lincoln's death, but because it shows him in a natural stance. \"You could put yourself in the shoes of the people around [Lincoln] and see what it was like to live at the White House,\" said Morgan, who says he receives 10 to 20 requests a day asking him to verify potential Lincoln photographs. Morgan, who purchased the photo from Grant, says he has received thousands of e-mails from Lincoln aficionados commenting on the find. His Web site, lincolnimages.com, received more than 5 million hits on Tuesday and crashed because of the traffic overload.", "2f6356ccd45d8dbc1051a37673fa3aacb9fba99a": "Editor's note: A gunman killed 10 people and himself Tuesday in southern Alabama. It's the most recent example of mass killing sprees that have traumatized communities over the years. Here's how one city responded. In the worst mass shooting in the U.S. at the time, a gunman killed 23 customers in a Texas cafeteria in 1991. (CNN) -- On October 16, 1991, 35-year-old George Hennard drove a pickup truck into Luby's cafeteria in Killeen, Texas, and fatally shot 23 people and wounded more than 20 before killing himself. For more than 15 years, the city next to the sprawling Fort Hood military base had the dubious distinction of being the site of the deadliest mass shooting in the United States -- until a student killed 32 people and himself at Virginia Tech in 2007. \"You can never prepare for an incident like this,\" says Killeen city councilman Fred Latham, who was mayor pro tem of the city, which had a population of about 66,000 at the time of the shooting. But Killeen's experience shows a city can survive the grief, pain and stigma of such an incident. About 80 people were in the cafeteria, many of them taking their bosses to lunch for National Bosses Day when Hennard arrived. He methodically chose his victims, most of whom were women, before he was wounded by police and shot himself. Latham, who is 60 and a real estate broker, has been on the city council off and on for 16 years. He spoke to CNN.com Wednesday. CNN: What are your memories of that day in October? Latham: It was a tragic day in our history, Many of the people who were killed or injured I personally knew. It was just a big shock that anything like that could ever happen in our community. CNN: Where were you when it happened? Latham: I was with the mayor and the Waco city engineer, looking at potential road improvements and we just happened to be driving near where Luby's was, and we saw some roadblocks being set up and we knew something terrible had happened. There were police cars and barricades and you had the sense that something was wrong. CNN: What are your memories of the days after the shooting? Latham: The community came together as far as trying to help resolve the issues with the people who were victims or their families who were trying to get through it. There were a lot of human resource agencies that came, American Red Cross, a lot of counselors. It was just overwhelming. I think the phones into Killeen were jammed from people all over the country trying to check on their family members. Luby's was the kind of place that would attract any kind of person. That was Bosses Day that particular day, so you had a lot of extra business there, I'm sure. And many of the people were in our school district. Our school district is one of the biggest employers in the region. So when you had administrators or people in that administration office killed, they're going to be known by many, many people. The commanding general at Fort Hood sent in helicopters and all kinds of extra assistance that might be needed. ...Fort Hood is the major employer in the area. At that time there were some 42,000 assigned troops there and some soldiers were actually killed. You can never prepare for an incident like this from somebody that just goes off. How they pick a destination you don't know. This person drove all the way from Belton, which is about 16 miles to our east. He wasn't a Killeen resident, so how he picked Luby's you don't know. He actually drove through the front window and the people that were in the restaurant thought maybe he had an accident where you try to apply the brakes and hit the gas pedal. .... When he came out shooting, the people were kind of trapped. I was proud of our community as to how they handled the situation and overcame all the adversity. Everybody was concerned about the welfare of the families and the people who were victims, Luby's began a fund to help defray some of the expenses and I think people from all over the country sent money. We formed a committee that helped look at how you disburse the money. I think that was successful and helped some with the aftermath. CNN: What are the emotions that a community goes through? Latham: Grief, just disbelief that something like this could happen, all the same emotions that you go through with any significant death in a family, I suppose. To have at the time...that this was worst shooting anywhere in the world, it gives a stigma that you don't ever want to have for your city. It's similar to the one that happened at Columbine and at Virginia Tech. Nobody has the answers as to why these things happen and the randomness of the person shooting his victims doesn't make any sense. It's not logical, you can't comprehend it. To see death happen to people, they were just there to have a meal with their boss and have a celebration of that and no interaction with the person that perpetrated this act. CNN: Were the churches and houses of worship involved in trying to heal the wounds? Latham: Absolutely, the churches throughout town came to the aid, performing counseling and having funeral services. There was a lot of compassion, if anything good came out of this, it was the fact that we realized that we all really cared more about each other more than we ever thought. CNN: Has the town recovered? Latham: It has been resilient. We've been in a dynamic part of central Texas where the economy has been good for many years. [There's] the resiliency and the strength of Fort Hood, which is one of the most efficient training facilities for the Army and it has continued to grow. A lot of people have retired here and the cost of living is good. There's affordable housing, the weather is good ... then you've got a work force that's educated and disciplined, and they're fairly young. CNN: You talked about the stigma of having the worst mass killing in the world. Latham: The tendency for the news media, each time an event like this happens, they'll list one, two, three, four, five, where the most killings occurred and you're mentioned in that top five. And that's not something we want to be reminded of. CNN: Some people say the stigma can hurt a town economically, but it doesn't seem to have done so in Killeen. Latham: We're a very mobile community. Our population turns over at least 30 percent every five years. Maybe two-thirds of our population [now] weren't even here or doesn't even know anything about this. So we're different from a longtime community that doesn't turn over like that. CNN: What advice would you have for other mayors or other city council people in towns who experience these kinds of incidents? Latham: Well I would accept help from others. You're not in it by yourself. You'll be surprised at the resiliency that you'll have as a community. The faith-based community will come forward, embrace that. You'll get through it, but you won't ever forget the victims or what has happened to the community.", "2bcfcbcbb7f3f3cda16a49e1c530dff05c757338": "BRASILIA, Brazil (CNN)  -- A doctor excommunicated by the Catholic Church for performing an abortion on a 9-year-old rape victim received a standing ovation during a national convention on women's health, according to a local media report. Archbishop Don Jose Cardoso Sobrinho excommunicated the doctors who performed the child's abortion. The response came during the opening ceremony of an event hosted by Brazilian Minister of Health Jose Gomes Temporao. The newspaper O Povo reported that Temporao called on the audience to acknowledge the \"brilliant\" work done by a medical team in the abortion, performed in Brazil's northeastern city of Recife. The girl was pregnant with twins after being raped, allegedly by her stepfather, police were quoted in media reports as saying. The abuse had gone on since the girl was 6, authorities said. The abortion was performed March 4 during the fourth month of pregnancy, according to media reports . Archbishop Don Jose Cardoso Sobrinho of Recife excommunicated the doctor, the child's mother and the medical team involved in the procedure. However, the stepfather was not excommunicated, with Sobrinho telling Globo TV that, \"A graver act than (rape) is abortion, to eliminate an innocent life.\" The child was not excommunicated, Sobrinho said, because Catholic Church law says minors are exempt from excommunication. \"The church is benevolent when it comes to minors,\" he told Globo TV. \"As for the adults, especially those who approved it, performed this abortion, the excommunication is applicable.\" \"God's law is above human laws,\" Sobrinho said. The case has outraged the Brazilian public and fueled a controversy reaching the highest levels of church and state in a nation whose law bans abortion except in cases of rape. Temporao recently said doctors must put law before religion. \"The question posed is very simple. There is a Brazilian law which states that a pregnancy can be interrupted in case of rape,\" Temporao said. \"It is legitimate for the church to have its dogmas, but these dogmas must not be imposed on society as a whole,\" he added. Earlier, a verbal spat ensued between President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and the archbishop over the church's decision. \"As a Christian and a Catholic, I find it deeply lamentable that a bishop of the Catholic Church has such a conservative attitude,\" Lula said on Globo TV. \"In this case, the medical profession was more right than the church,\" he said. Meanwhile, a Vatican cleric told Italy's La Stampa newspaper that he supports the Brazilian archbishop's decision to excommunicate all involved in the abortion except for the child. Dr. Olimpio Moraes, one of the doctors involved in the procedure, said he thanked the archbishop for his excommunication because the controversy sheds light on Brazil's restrictive abortion laws. He said women in Brazil's countryside are victimized by Brazil's ban on abortion. Some of the doctors vowed to continue attending church services, despite being expelled. \"The fact that I was excommunicated will not keep me from going to Mass, praying, conversing with God, and asking him to illuminate me and my colleagues in our medical team to help us take care of people in similar cases,\" one doctor said. TV Globo reported that the child, who is from a town outside Recife, has stayed in the city to recover and to escape media coverage. Her current condition is not known. A new report by Brazil's IPAS, a non-governmental organization that works with the health ministry, indicates that more than 1 million women undergo illegal abortions in Brazil each year. About 250,000 are treated by doctors for traumas due to botched abortions, said Beatriz Jalli, an IPAS official. Studies at a Brazilian hospital dedicated to treating female victims of violence, the Perola Byington in Sao Paulo, indicated that more than 40 percent of the cases involved children. \"This is why the Recife case is so important for women in Brazil,\" Jalli said. Jalli said the liberated \"Girl from Ipanema\" image that many foreigners have of Brazilian women is far from reality. \"We live in a male chauvinistic, patriarchal society with a very high rate of sexual crimes against women and minors,\" she said. \"Our reproductive rights are constantly criminalized.\" CNN's Helena de Moura contributed to this report.", "503da4e6a59062957f5dad1fda5fd70185088c00": "(CNN) -- Just days after giving birth to her second child, Dr. Jane Dimer drove herself home from the hospital to find her then-husband in bed with another woman. He threw Dimer down the stairs, and she never saw him again until court. Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, before the Grammys on February 8. Dimer, now an obstetrician-gynecologist at Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, Washington, had been in an abusive relationship with her husband in Germany for 4\u00bd years until he pushed her out 11 years ago. \"Emotionally, the remnants of that stay for a long time,\" she said. Domestic violence is the most common cause of injury to women ages 15 to 44, according to the National Institutes of Health. With the entertainment world buzzing about pop sensation Rihanna, whose boyfriend Chris Brown has been formally charged with assaulting her, public interest in domestic violence has been reinvigorated. Abuse can influence a victim's future behavior in relationships and even in friendships, depending on whether the victim stays or leaves, said Mark Crawford, a clinical psychologist based in Roswell, Georgia. Those who stay are likely to stop trusting their own perceptions and become passive in both romantic and nonromantic relationships. Victims who do leave -- which is the healthier choice, Crawford said -- often become over-accommodating because they want to avoid conflict, even verbal disputes, at all costs. Some women won't trust people easily, if at all, and won't be able to handle even normal expressions of anger. Visit CNNHealth.com, your connection to better living . \"What they need to do when they get out of the relationship is make sure they're aware of their own anger, and then they can learn how to freely express it in a healthy, normal way,\" he said. \"If somebody's still having issues 10 years later, they just haven't worked through it. They haven't healed; they need to do that.\" New research shows that abuse victims feel the impact of violence long after it occurred. A recent study in the Journal of Women's Health found that older African-American women who were exposed to high levels of family violence at some point in their lifetimes -- whether by a partner or family member -- are at a greater risk of poor mental and physical health status. \"Not just ongoing violence, which everybody thinks about, but even when it's over, there's something about what happens that seems to have a lingering effect that we don't quite understand yet,\" said Dr. Anuradha Paranjape, co-author of the study and associate professor at Temple University School of Medicine. It makes sense that abused women would report worse health, given that people in stressful situations have higher levels of stress hormones, which interfere with immune function, Crawford said. Other studies show a clear connection between depression and abuse. Adult women who have been abused in a relationship in the past five years have rates of depression 2\u00bd times greater than women who have never been abused, according to a different study of more than 3,000 women. They are also more likely to be socially isolated, said author Amy Bonomi, associate professor at The Ohio State University. Women who have been abused prior to, but not during, the past five years had depression rates 1\u00bd times greater than those without abuse experience, said Bonomi, who has collaborated with Dimer on research on abused women. \"People like to sort of think that, 'Well, abuse is just when you have a black eye, you sustain a broken bone,' \" Bonomi said. \"But we see lots of different effects in other areas, like depression and social isolation, and we've actually proven that with the data.\" Women who have suffered violence also seem to have a greater likelihood of substance abuse, but it's unclear how the two are related -- one doesn't necessarily cause the other, and there could be other factors involved, Bonomi said. A 2008 study of 3,333 women, which Bonomi worked on, found that middle-aged women who suffered child abuse, sexual or other physical abuse, had a greater likelihood of depression, as well as a higher body mass index. These women also spend up to one-third more than average on health care costs. About 34 percent of women in the sample said they had been abused. While Paranjape's study found that women with the highest levels of abuse reported having poor health, the same number of diseases were reported among those women as the women in the sample who had less or no abuse. This indicates that there is something else that makes abused women report feeling unwell, she said. \"When your patient says they don't feel so good, you might want to think about asking what other issues may be going on,\" she said. People who have gotten out of a relationship should go through the work of learning what issues set them up in that situation, and reflect on the warning signs, Crawford said. Experts recommend finding a counselor and other means of support, but people who have been abused should think twice about revealing too much in online support groups, because their abusers could discover what they're saying, Dimer said. Research has also shown that violence escalates in abusive relationships among couples who go to marriage counseling, she said. Some women do feel stronger having been through the experience of abuse, Dimer said. She herself found healing through advocacy and research on the subject, she said. Calling a domestic violence hot line is a good first step for anyone who is experiencing abuse, Dimer said. \"Whether you're a pop star or somebody that's working front lines -- an employee at a grocery store selling the pop star magazine -- you're at equal risk for having this,\" she said.", "31ce56bbc9d1ef7398577b51ee7400fcb6268f08": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A meningitis outbreak is threatening the lives of tens of thousands of people in Darfur, according to an aid agency expelled from the country last week. A Doctors without Borders medic helps a sick child in a Darfur refugee camp. Humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders, also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), says it was preparing to vaccinate around 100,000 people in southern and western Darfur against meningitis, when it was told to leave the country. \"We were in the process of organizing a vaccination campaign. At the moment  there's no one there that can take over those activities, which is really worrying,\" Gemma Davies of MSF told CNN. The country's Ministry of Health officially declared a meningitis outbreak on March 2 at the Kalma Camp, which shelters more than 90,000 refugees in southern Darfur. \"Living in such close proximity, the potential for this outbreak to spread quickly is quite high, Davies, MSF project coordinator for South Darfur, told CNN. \"With no health care providers to give vaccinations, and with no one to manage the meningitis cases when they come, it's really concerning,\" she added. The vaccination campaign was due to begin on March 7, but it is now unclear if or when it will resume, as reports of government harassment of aid workers continue. Davies told CNN she experienced no harassment, and said government officials had  been in contact with only the head of MSF's regional operations. \"We haven't actually been given any reason on why we were expelled,\" she said. \"We have absolutely no idea when we'll be able to return.\" Doctors Without Borders was among 13 aid agencies, including Mercy Corps and the International Rescue Committee, that were ordered by the government to shut down their operations in Sudan last week. So far the agency has confirmed 32 meningitis cases and four deaths, and has seen dozens of other suspected cases. Thousands of unvaccinated refugees and villagers are now exposed to the airborne disease in densely populated camps and villages throughout Sudan. \"One of our priorities is to get another organization to take over our programs there,\" Davies added. The medical relief agency says it doubts though that other any other organizations have the capacity to deal with a meningitis epidemic. Davies also said she is worried about the cut-off of MSF's feeding and maternal delivery services: \"We had over 100 patients on our feeding program that now won't be receiving any follow up.\" The decision by the Sudanese government to throw out the aid groups came a day after the International Criminal Court at The Hague issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. However, not all international aid organizations are affected. Others including World Vision international continues its work, which reaches approximately 500,000 internally displaced people in South Sudan. The U.N. has received reports that international staff members of five non-governmental organizations had been detained for up to four hours. Speaking on the phone from Nairobi, an aid worker, who asked not to be identified for fear of further harassment, told CNN that his colleagues who remained in Khartoum were being intimidated and threatened by government agents. In some cases Sudanese government representatives \"had started gathering banking details and confiscating computers, communications equipment and vehicles from the NGOs\", a U.N spokesman said at a news conference last week. Last week, the U.N. warned that the loss of  NGOs in Sudan would cause 1.1 million people to go without food aid and health care, and more than 1 million to have no access to water. Oxfam, whose work focuses on providing safe drinking water, was one of the aid groups who were told their registration to operate in Sudan was no longer valid. Ninety percent of their staff are Sudanese nationals, who mostly remain in country, unable to continue their relief work under threat of arrest. \"These agencies are vital implementation partners for the United Nations and account for at least half of the humanitarian capacity in Darfur,\" said Catherine Bragg, U.N.

South Korean protesters protest against government's policy on U.S. beef imports on Saturday. South Korean police estimate that the crowd in Seoul is about 50,000. No clashes were reported between the protesters and riot police, although ongoing protests have at times turned violent. South Koreans have protested regularly since April when the government announced it would resume importing beef from the United States after a five-year ban. That ban was instituted over a case of mad cow disease in the United States in 2003. The widespread public protests essentially paralyzed the government of President Lee Myung-bak, who replaced seven top aides this month and plans to reshuffle his Cabinet. Tens of thousands of auto workers in South Korea went on strike Wednesday to oppose the government's lifting of the ban. After a series of negotiations, Seoul and Washington came up with a revised agreement on June 21 -- one that limits imports to cattle younger than 30 months old. Animals older than 30 months old are considered at a greater risk for mad cow disease, which can be transmitted to humans. The revised agreement also excludes the import of certain parts believed more susceptible to mad cow disease. The initial deal would have allowed the import of all U.S. beef imports. Scientists believe mad cow disease spreads when farmers feed cattle recycled meat and bones from infected animals. The U.S. banned recycled feeds in 1997. Eating meat products contaminated with the illness has been linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare and fatal malady in humans. Until the 2003 ban, South Korea was the third-largest market for U.S. beef exporters. South Korea's new pro-U.S. president agreed to lift the import ban in April before a summit with U.S. President George W. Bush. But the move provoked a backlash over health concerns spurred in part by false media reports about risks, along with a sense that South Korea had backed down too easily to American pressure. The government has vowed to get tough with the rallies. In Washington, the White House announced that Bush would visit South Korea on August 5-6 before heading to the Beijing Olympics. Bush had originally been expected to go to Seoul next week when he visits Japan for the G-8 summit, but the trip did not materialize amid the protests.

The pain is easing, but it's a nagging ache just the same. The rush-hour train bombings killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others. It was March 11, 2004, during morning rush hour, that terrorists armed with powerful bombs boarded these same commuter train lines, unleashing an onslaught that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others. The attacks are the deadliest in Europe since the rise of al Qaeda. More than a year later on July 7, 2005, terrorists would stage bombings on the London transit system that killed 52 people and wounded hundreds more. The explosives were left on the Spanish trains in sports bags and backpacks -- sometimes placed under seats -- court documents say. The terrorists got off at various stations down the line, before cell-phone timers detonated 10 bombs in quick succession on four trains at three stations. Police dismantled another bomb that didn't explode. It provided vital clues that led to arrests. Eighteen people, mostly Islamic militants, have been convicted in the attacks. Watch more on the anniversary . Juan Carlos Garcia, an engineer who took the train later that same day, said he knows a couple whose daughter died in the attacks. \"It was very tough, especially knowing it could have been you,\" Garcia said. \"Now, you remember it, but not the same as when it just happened.\" Beata Sadecka, a regular commuter, says she rides cautiously. \"Every day, when I get on the train, I always ride in the last car,\" Sadecka said. \"I don't know why, for safety,\" she added, not quite sure of her motives.

The portrait of William Shakespeare is thought to be the \"only\" portrait painted during his lifetime. The image reveals a wealthy Shakespeare of high social status, contradicting the popular view of a struggling playwright of humble status, according to Stanley Wells, a professor who chairs London's Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. Wells, a distinguished Shakespeare scholar, arranged for three years of research and scientific testing which confirmed it was painted around 1610, when Shakespeare would have been 46 years old. \"A rather young looking 46, it has to be said,\" Wells said. Shakespeare died in 1616. The Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard. The most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes. The identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait. The portrait \"shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,\" Wells said. \"It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,\" Wells said. \"There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life.\" Wells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face. \"I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,\" he said. \"It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'\" It should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king. The public can read Shakespeare's face from the original painting at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon where it goes on display for several months starting April 23. The portrait then returns to the Cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married England's Earl of Southampton -- a friend of Shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.", "6cb01372bb85aca6c0da0870aa6249c213ff74bf": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Key members of Congress from both parties want NASA's internal watchdog fired, arguing he can't be trusted to oversee the $1 billion in additional money the space agency is getting under the Obama administration's economic stimulus package. Lawmakers say NASA's inspector general cannot be trusted and must go. Government reports dating back to 2006 have accused NASA Inspector General Robert \"Moose\" Cobb of ineffectiveness, of profanely berating employees and being too close to the agency's leadership. Calls for his ouster have intensified in the past month, since NASA is getting additional stimulus money for space exploration, research, and aeronautics. \"Apparently, Mr. Cobb thought he was supposed to be the lap dog, rather than the watchdog, of NASA,\" Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tennessee, told CNN. Gordon, chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology, has asked President Obama to remove Cobb. In a letter co-authored by Rep. Brad Miller, D-North Carolina, who leads the House Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, the lawmakers argue that \"NASA cannot afford another four years with an ineffective inspector general.\"  Watch NASA watchdog under fire \u00bb . \"It's incredibly ironic for members of Congress who have scolded the inspector general for lousy oversight to dump a billion dollars into the agency,\" said Pete Sepp, vice president of the National Taxpayers Union, a nonprofit, nonpartisan watchdog group that monitors government spending. \"The first thing you do when you're digging a hole is to stop digging. Congress doesn't seem to get that message.\" Cobb declined two requests from CNN to respond to the complaints. In December 2008, the Government Accountability Office released a report that criticized how Cobb was running the inspector general's office. The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, \"found that Mr. Cobb is one of the least productive IGs in the federal government,\" Gordon and Miller wrote. \"His monetary accomplishments reflect a return of just 36 cents for every dollar budgeted for his office. This compares with an average of $9.49 returned for every dollar spent on other IGs' offices. The main reason for this failure is that NASA's audit operation is not working.\" Gordon told CNN that Cobb's \"own peers said he wasn't doing his job, that he didn't understand the audit process and that he was not carrying out the investigation process. As a matter of fact, he was slowing it down, or even stopping it.\" And Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, agreed that Cobb must be replaced. \"Inspectors general are the first line of defense against the waste of taxpayers' money,\" Grassley told CNN. \"And, if he's not doing his job, and you stick another billion dollars into it, then you just know there's another billion dollars that there could be a lot of waste of it.\" A 2006 investigation by a presidential integrity council found Cobb \"engaged in abuse of authority\" and had a \"close relationship\" with former NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe that \"compromised\" his independence. The two played golf together and took official trips together on NASA aircraft. Read investigative integrity report (Warning: Report contains explicit language) The committee also found that Cobb \"engaged in an abuse of authority\" through his \"habitual use of profanity,\" and recommended disciplinary action \"up to and including removal,\" Gordon and Miller wrote. Cobb defended himself at a 2007 congressional hearing, arguing that he had upheld his oath of office. \"At NASA, I have taken the responsibilities of office under the Inspector General Act seriously and without compromise to root out and prevent fraud, waste and abuse, and to promote the economy and efficiency of the agency,\" he said. \"I've worked with NASA management in the manner contemplated by the Inspector General Act.\" But former staffers told the committee that Cobb created a disturbing work environment. \"One of my early experiences with Mr. Cobb was so disturbing that I considered leaving the OIG almost immediately afterwards,\" said Debra Herzog, former deputy assistant inspector-general for investigations. \"At a scheduled weekly meeting, Mr. Cobb, in front of his deputy and my supervisor, berated me concerning a word in a letter. In an ensuing monologue, loudly peppered with profanities, Mr. Cobb insulted and ridiculed me,\" Herzog recounted. Lance Carrington, the former assistant inspector general for investigations, told the panel that \"in many investigative cases, Mr. Cobb appeared to have a lack of independence when NASA officials were subjects, or if arrest/search warrants were obtained for NASA facilities. Mr. Cobb would question every aspect of the cases and gave the appearance he wanted to derail them before agents were given adequate time to investigate the allegations.\" Gordon told CNN it's time for Cobb to go. \"President Obama needs to replace Mr. Cobb as quickly as possible with someone who can do the job,\" he said.", "a63c05ab7c5b5dce4b58f61c9aa772317bbac17e": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The top court in Iraq sentenced two of Saddam Hussein's half-brothers to death Wednesday for crimes against humanity.

The men were sentenced for their roles in the 1992 execution of 42 merchants. In an unrelated trial last week, Al-Majeed was sentenced to death for his role in putting down an uprising in Baghdad a decade ago, Iraqi state TV reported. It was the third death sentence for al-Majeed, a cousin of Hussein, the former dictator of Iraq who was toppled from power by the U.S.-led coalition in 2003. Al-Majeed and other former members of Hussein's regime remain in U.S. custody. His execution has been delayed for political rather than legal reasons. In last week's trial, Aziz was acquitted.

Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton present the State Department Women of Courage Awards. The event was to celebrate the State Department Women of Courage Awards, but highlighted how both the current and former first ladies have made women's rights a signature issue. Since calling women's rights a human rights issue at a women's conference in Beijing in 1995, Clinton has made it a personal mission to champion the rights of women. Her first two trips as secretary of state have been packed with events promoting the importance of women's rights. \"These personal experiences have informed my work, and I will continue to fight for human rights as secretary of state in traditional and especially nontraditional ways and venues,\" Clinton told the audience.

Obama said the work done by the honorees has not just changed their own circumstances, but by inspiring hope and motivating others to act, that work also has changed women's lives around the world. \"This is how real change occurs, one determined woman at a time. And change is coming,\" she said. \"The women we honor today teach us three very important lessons. One, that as women, we must stand up for ourselves. The second, as women we must stand up for each other. And finally, as women we must stand up for justice for all.\" On Wednesday, President Obama created a White House Council on Women and Girls, charged with devising a coordinated federal response to various challenges faced by American women. The council, which will be led by senior presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett and which will include most members of the president's Cabinet, will be charged with ensuring that all governmental agencies take the needs of women into account. The president said the council will also help ensure a more coordinated federal response on a range of issues, including equal pay, family leave and child care. He also nominated Melanne Verveer, Clinton's chief of staff when she was first lady, as ambassador-at-large for global women's issues.

Susanne Klatten, the BMW heiress, complained to police last year that Helg Sgarbi had threatened to release pictures of them if she did not pay him nearly $60 million. Munich's state prosecutor Anton Winkler said Sgarbi, who was accused of blackmailing several wealthy women, had made a written confession which was read by his lawyer to the court. \"He confessed that he blackmailed the victims, told them untrue stories,\" Winkler told CNN.

We asked him about where the money is, about accomplices and videos... and he refused to say anything about that,\" Winkler said. Authorities said Klatten, who is married with three children, had an affair with Sgarbi. He started to ask her for money, and she paid several million at first, but when she refused to provide more he threatened to send compromising videos to her husband and the media. Klatten went to the police in January 2008, telling them she was the victim of a fraud and blackmail. At the time, her spokesman, Joerg Appelhans, told CNN that Sgarbi's goal had always been to con her. \"She rigorously notified authorities even in light of the uncomfortable public repercussions this would have for her,\" Appelhans said.

CNN \"American Morning\" anchor Kiran Chetry spoke with the mayors of the two towns on Wednesday. They are Mayor Wynnton Melton of Geneva, Alabama, and Clay King of Samson, Alabama. Kiran Chetry, CNN anchor: Police have identified the gunman who they say went on a killing spree in southern Alabama yesterday afternoon. They say Michael McClendon murdered 10 people, including his own mother, his grandparents, an aunt, an uncle, along with a sheriff's deputy's wife and child. And these are crime scenes now spread out across two small towns this morning. And their mayors join us now, Wynnton Melton of Geneva, Alabama, and Clay King of Samson, Alabama. Mayor King, let me start with you. ... You knew all of the victims and also the shooting suspect who took his own life as well. What can you tell us about the situation this morning, Mayor King? Mayor Clay King, Samson, Alabama: Well, the whole community is still in shock. Like I said, we know, I personally know everyone that is involved, both the shooter and the victims. And that makes it more difficult to have to deal with.  Watch the mayors talk of the tragedy \u00bb . Chetry: And Mayor King, you say you coached him, along with your own sons in T-ball, in Little League, and that you would have never had any idea that he could have done something like this. Is there any motive that people are talking about this morning? King: No, ma'am. At this time, I don't think anybody has any idea of what the motive is. And yes, I did. I coached the shooter's -- I coached him in both T-ball and in Little League baseball along with my two sons. Chetry: And Mayor Melton, I want to ask you about this situation. I mean, this turned -- it appears from the beginning, this shooter targeted people within his own family. After that, it turned into really a random shooting spree. He had a semiautomatic, according to police, and he was firing at random until the sheriffs were able to corner him at this place of business. What are you learning about just how dire the circumstances were and how law enforcement was able to respond the way they did? Mayor Wynnton Melton, Geneva, Alabama: That is correct. And the response was very quick. He was intercepted in Geneva by one of our officers, and then the chief of police arrived at the scene. Both of those received fire from the assailant. The chief of police was nicked in the arm, not very seriously. The pursuit went on to the metal fabrication plant, Reliable, where an exchange of gunfire occurred in the parking lot. The suspect went into the building and took his own life there inside the building, which probably had around 400 people working at the time. But no injuries there at all, in the building. He took his own life at that point. Chetry: And Mayor King, it's also just so ironic that one of the sheriff's deputies who was actually responding to the call of this emergency going on, it was his wife and one of his children killed, and his second child also airlifted to a hospital in Florida. What is going on with that situation? How did that family become involved in any way in this shooting? King: They just happened to be over across the street visiting with the family. Chetry: The family, the grandfather, grandmother, uncle and aunt who were out on the porch? King: Right, right. Chetry: So, just an unfortunate circumstance. So, besides his family, you guys are investigating this, or your authorities are, as a random act? I mean, I know that this is going to be tough for you guys because these crime scenes are spread out over both towns, so many different locations. How are you tackling this? King: Well, we're very fortunate. We received a call from the governor this afternoon. And they have -- we've got the department of public safety here, ABI, ABC, FBI.

Lionel Messi, left, and Thierry Henry celebrate as Barcelona reach the last eight of the Champions League. Former winners Porto joined them at the next stage after their return leg against Atletico finished goalless in Lisbon -- the 2-2 draw in the first leg in Madrid sending them through on the away goals. Spain's Primera Liga leaders Barcelona strolled into a 4-0 first half lead on their way to a 6-3 aggregate success with Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o building on Henry's double. Jean Makoun pulled one back just before half-time and Juninho struck three minutes after the restart, but the French champions never looked like disturbing Barca's path to the March 20 draw. Lyon's hopes suffered another blow when Juninho was given his marching orders after picking up a second yellow card in time added on and Seydou Keita took full advantage by snatching another in the final seconds. Having conceded an away goal in a 1-1 draw in the first leg at the Stade Gerland, Lyon had to score to stand any chance of progressing. After a fairly even opening, a quickfire double from Henry dictated the outcome of the tie. After 25 minutes he latched onto a ball from Rafael Marquez, beating the offside trap to slide the ball under Hugo Lloris. Two minutes later Henry doubled the lead when he slid the ball in at the near post past the advancing Lloris. Messi showed his class in the 40th minute. The Argentina star collected the ball on the right touchline, before embarking on a mazy run past three Lyon defenders. He then exchanged a one-two with Eto'o, before firing a low shot home. Eto'o was desperate to get on the scoresheet himself as he stormed into the box from the left, only to see his shot saved by Lloris from point-blank range. Within a minute, though, he had made amends as he popped up in the box, side-stepped his marker and smashed the ball home. A minute from the break, Makoun made it 4-1 as he headed home Juninho's corner. And the former Brazil midfielder got on the scoresheet himself three minutes after the break following a cross from Cesar Delgado. Any thoughts of a comeback failed to materialise as Barca continued to create a raft of chances. As the game moved, into stoppage time, Juninho picked up a second booking for dissent and moments later Mali midfielder Keita made it five for Barca.", "c9b3fcee7876513b8bf122399dbcdc1e46cb89a6": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A football team from southern Italy is hoping for entry into the Guinness World Records because all their players have the same surname, according to a media report.

If you're Beat Ettlin, you wrest the marsupial into a headlock, drag it down your hallway and toss it out your front door. Ettlin and his family were woken early Sunday when a 6-foot-tall kangaroo crashed through a window, landed on their bed and thrashed around their house in the suburb of Garran, south of the capital of Canberra, Australia. \"At first, he (my husband) thought it was a lunatic ninja,\" said Ettlin's wife, Verity Beman. \"It leaped through the window, this martial-arts kind of figure. It was very Jackie Chan.\" The family's one-story house is in a suburb that butts against a kangaroo reserve. About 2 a.m. Sunday, their dog began barking furiously. Possibly possums, they thought. The family had put up with possums scampering across their roof every night since they moved in three weeks ago. Moments later, the window was smashed and a black figure landed on their bed. Ettlin, after gathering his wits about him, exclaimed, \"It's OK. It's only a kangaroo,\" Beman recalled. \"I was cowered under the quilt, thinking, 'No, it's not OK,'\" she said. The kangaroo jumped on top of the blanket that Beman and her 9-year-old daughter were hiding under. It then leaped onto the nightstand, punched holes in the furniture and left blood stains on the wall as it bounced into their son's room. \"That's when his male instinct kicked in,\" Beman said of her husband. After putting the 90-pound creature in a choke hold, Ettlin kept it low to the ground and pulled it toward the front door. He knew that kangaroos carry their strength on their hind legs, Beman said. \"He held it by one arm. He opened the front door with the other, then the screen door,\" she said. \"It bounced across our veranda and bounced away.\" Ettlin is a chef, originally from the Swiss city of Stans. Beman thinks he would not have tackled the kangaroo so readily were he Australian. \"They would be fully aware of the risk,\" she said. The house in shambles -- with blood and shattered glass everywhere -- Ettlin stood surveying the damage in his shredded underpants. Scratch marks ran down his leg, but otherwise he was fine. \"I kept marveling at what he did,\" Beman said. \"I called him my hero.

Kimberly Dawn Trenor received a life sentence without possibility of parole in the murder of her daughter. Kimberly Dawn Trenor, 20, showed no emotion as the verdict was read late Monday. Trenor had pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence in the case, but pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charge. She received a life sentence without the possibility of parole. The body of Trenor's daughter, Riley Ann Sawyers, was found in October 2007 in a large blue plastic container on an uninhabited island in Galveston Bay. Two-year-old Riley Ann's case drew national attention after a fisherman found her body. Authorities didn't know her identity, and police dubbed her \"Baby Grace.\" After authorities distributed composite sketches of the girl nationwide, Sheryl Sawyers, the girl's paternal grandmother, contacted police from her Ohio home to say the drawing resembled her granddaughter. DNA testing confirmed the child's identity. According to an affidavit, Trenor told police Riley had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held under water before she died on July 24, 2007.

The shooter, Michael McLendon, killed his mother before killing others. Michael McLendon, 28, fatally shot his mother in his hometown of Kinston on Tuesday before driving to nearby Samson and Geneva, killing nine more, then fatally shooting himself after a shootout with police. Authorities are calling it the deadliest single assault in recorded Alabama history. \"He was going to go until he was stopped, by himself or someone else,\" said Col. Chris Murphy of the Alabama Department of Public Safety. \"He had obviously planned to go out in grand style.\" McLendon left behind a letter, apparently after killing his mother, that described how he did so and saying that he planned to kill himself, according to Murphy. The letter \"describes how McLendon harbored ill feelings toward family members due to a family dispute.\" McLendon -- a self-proclaimed survivalist who was known to train with the rifles he used in the shooting spree -- enlisted in the Marines in 1999, but was kicked out one month later for \"fraudulent enlistment,\" Murphy said. He was hired as a police officer in 2003, but let go a month later for what Murphy called physical issues. The nearly hourlong assault ended 24 miles from where it began at Reliable Metal Products plant in Geneva, where McLendon had worked in 2003. \"McLendon made statements of being depressed and was dissatisfied with his present position in life,\" Murphy said. \"His dream was to become a Marine, and later a police officer. Both those dreams were unfulfilled.\" McLendon was armed with two assault rifles -- an SKS and a Bushmaster -- and two pistols, and a shotgun was found in his car. \"At this time, we believe that he fired in excess of 200 rounds during the assaults,\" the Department of Public Safety said in a news release. McLendon had no known criminal record before carrying out the rampage, officials said. Coffee County district attorney Gary McAliley said neighbors and co-workers described McLendon as quiet and shy. Some neighbors complained that he was always shooting firearms behind his home, he said -- but feared only that McLendon would accidentally kill one of their cows.

Co-workers at Kelley Foods, where he unexpectedly resigned last week, said they had a nickname for him -- Doughboy -- that he didn't like. \"I don't think anybody could have anticipated this by looking at him and interacting with him,\" McAliley said. \"But, certainly he had a volcano inside of him.\" McLendon called the Samson City Hall about 1 p.m. Tuesday and asked whether the city council would be meeting in the evening, Michelle Flanery, magistrate and billing clerk, told CNN Radio. Flanery said she replied that there was no meeting scheduled that day and that McLendon thanked her before hanging up. Authorities said McLendon also had a list of current and former co-workers, some whose names were accompanied by notes on ways he felt they'd wronged him. But the note was not a \"hit list,\" as had been reported, and none of the people whose names were listed were attacked, they said.   View images from the rampage \u00bb . Among the dead were the wife and toddler of Geneva County Sheriff's Deputy Josh Myers, who was involved in the standoff with McLendon before he realized his own loss.

The shootings rattled Samson and Geneva, neither of which has a population beyond 4,500 people, and sent shock waves outside the small towns affected. \"This event formed the single deadliest crime recorded in Alabama,\" said Murphy of the Department of Public Safety.

Bob Riley arrived in Geneva County on Wednesday afternoon, pledging support to the community and members of law enforcement. \"I think it's a combination of just shock and disbelief,\" said Riley, a native of Ashland, Alabama, population 2,500, in east Alabama. \"I live in a little small town about like this, and I know what it would be like in my community.

German shooter Tim Kretschmer, 17, targeted females during his rampage. Tim Kretschmer, 17, began his rampage at a school where he used to be a student in Winnenden, a small town about 20 kilometers (12 miles) northeast of Stuttgart. Most of the victims at the school were female -- eight female students, three female teachers and one male student, said Heribert Rech, interior minister for Baden Wuerttemberg region. Rech said: \"They were completely taken by surprise. Some of the victims still had their pens in their hands.\" Kretschmer opened fire in three first floor classrooms, including a physics lab where a teacher was found dead behind her desk, Rech told a news conference. Rech said police arrived in minutes. \"This speedy intervention means they prevented further escalation of events.\" The shooting at the Albertville-Realschule Winnenden school began around 9:45 a.m. (0845 GMT) and lasted about two minutes. Student Louis Schweizer was in class when he heard the gunshots. \"When I came out, I saw the shell casings lying around everywhere,\" he said. His sister, Lisa Schweizer, also heard the shots. \"It is a tragedy,\" she said. \"One of my teachers was killed.\" Another student told CNN: \"We heard that someone was inside shooting.

As the first police arrived at the school, he fled and killed a person working in a hospital nearby, then hijacked a car, taking the driver hostage. He drove towards the nearby town of Wendlingen, but the car crashed on a sharp bend, Rech said. The driver escaped and called police as Kretschmer ran away and towards a car salesroom in Wendlingen where he shot a salesperson and a customer, Rech said.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was \"inconceivable that within seconds school students and teachers have been put to death by this terrible crime.\" \"It is a day of mourning for the whole of Germany,\" she said in a televised statement. Police did not know the motive for the shooting spree, CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Winnenden. \"No one seems to have an explanation for why this happened,\" he said. \"Police officers have heard that this young man didn't cause much of a buzz, wasn't someone who was negative or known for violence. They have no idea why he did all this.\" Police raided his parents' home later and found they had a collection of 14 guns. The pistol used in the killing was part of the father's collection, authorities said. German gun laws are fairly restrictive and require owners to control access to them. Do you think the gun control issue is taken seriously enough? Rech said the guns were legally owned by Kretschmer's father who is a member of a gun club. At least seven people were injured in the shootings -- five people in Winnenden and two police officers in Wendlingen -- police spokeswoman Renate Roesch added. She was unable to say how serious the injuries were. Six teenagers from the from the school shooting were transported to the Waiblingen hospital with undisclosed injuries. One of those patients has already been released from the hospital, according to a hospital spokeswoman. The families of the dead have been informed and are receiving counseling, Roesch said.

One survivor, identified as Robert Decker, was found and taken to a hospital, but efforts to find more survivors had proven fruitless, said Maj. Denis McGuire of the Rescue Coordination Center in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The body of one person, who has not been identified publicly, also was pulled from the water. There were 18 people aboard the helicopter when it went down, about 30 nautical miles from St. John's. \"All we've got is the debris field,\" McGuire said. \"There are no indications of any [more] survivors, but the search will continue.\" The water is 400 feet deep at the site where the helicopter hit the water, he said. Helicopters and ships were scouring the debris field Thursday evening, and search-and-rescue technicians were planning to use night-vision goggles and flares overnight. The debris filled a six-mile area, said Jeri Grychowski of the Rescue Coordination Centre in Halifax. Officials became aware that the helicopter was having problems shortly after 9:10 a.m., when the pilot declared a mayday, McGuire said. \"They declared their mayday and then they hit the water or landed in the water approximately eight minutes later,\" he said. About 25 minutes later, a helicopter arrived and discovered the survivor, the body, the overturned helicopter and two empty life rafts, he said. Those aboard should have have been wearing survival suits that would have kept them dry and were equipped with lights and personal locator beacons, but the suits have not helped searchers. \"We have not received any signals whatsoever,\" McGuire said. The suits theoretically would allow wearers to survive 24 hours in the freezing waters -- or until about 9 a.m. Friday -- but the search effort was to continue well beyond that. \"We will continue to search until there's absolutely no chance that any survivors will be located,\" he said. \"Until last light [Friday].\" At that time, based on water temperature and the size of the search area, officials will decide whether to continue the effort, he said. Early in the day, high winds and seas hampered the search, but by late afternoon, the weather had improved, though seas were still about 13 to 16 feet (4 to 5 meters) and winds were at about 40 knots (46 mph). The survivor was taken to the Health Sciences Center in St. John's, Newfoundland.

The attack -- which occurred outside the municipal building of Abu Ghraib in western Baghdad -- also wounded 46 others, the official said. The attacker was targeting the latest effort by the government to foster national reconciliation between religious and ethnic groups. Sunni Arab and Shiite tribal leaders were attending the meeting, backed by the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government. Another Interior Ministry official told CNN the attack occurred when people gathered outside as the conference in the building ended. Al-Baghdadiya TV said two of its journalists were killed in the explosion. An Iraqi journalists' group confirmed those deaths and said a number of journalists were also wounded. Along with meeting attendees and journalists, Iraqi soldiers were among the casualties. No one has claimed responsibility for the strike, but in the past, such gatherings have been targeted by al Qaeda in Iraq, the anti-American Sunni Arab militant group. Staffan de Mistura, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general for Iraq, deplored the attack and passed along condolences to grieving families. He said the bombing targeted the tribal leaders after their meeting, and called the strike a \"horrible crime that is designed to sabotage reconciliatory efforts by the Iraqi people, who, I am confident, will continue on the road of dialogue.\" The blast follows another huge attack on Sunday, when a man wearing an explosives-laden vest drove a motorcycle rigged with bombs into a group of police recruits in eastern Baghdad. That attack killed 30 people and wounded 61 others. Most of the victims of Sunday's strike were police officers and recruits who had gathered outside a police academy on Palestine Street. The same academy was targeted on December 1 in a double bombing that killed 16 and wounded 46.

File image of a Pakistani soldier . The troops were deployed from Pakistan's western border with Afghanistan, where forces have been battling Taliban and al Qaeda militants in North West Frontier Province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Pakistan's armed forces have been on high alert in anticipation of a possible conflict with India following last month's terrorist attacks in Mumbai, which killed 160 people. India believes the 10 men who carried out the attacks were trained at a terrorist camp in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir. A senior official said the troops had been moved from areas where there are no active military operations, and emphasized that troop levels have not been depleted in areas where soldiers are battling militants, such as the Swat Valley and near Peshawar, capital of the North West region. In addition to the move, leave for all military personnel has been restricted and all troops were called back to active duty, the senior official said. Asked for a reaction to the development, Husain Haqqani, Pakistani ambassador to the United States, said, \"Pakistan does not seek war, but we need to be vigilant against threats of war emanating from the other side of our eastern border.\" He said Pakistan's conduct since the Mumbai attack \"has been consistent with international expectations. There is no justification for threats against Pakistan.\" \"Pakistan is also a victim of terrorism and will continue to act against terrorists,\" he added. \"We are a country of rule of law and need evidence to prosecute anyone for the crime of terrorism.\" U.S. National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the United States has been \"in close contact\" with India and Pakistan in probing the Mumbai attack and fighting terror. He is hoping that \"both sides will avoid taking steps that will unnecessarily raise tensions during these already tense times.\" In London, England, Pakistani envoy to Britain Wajid Shamsul Hasan countered the report, noting that winter redeployments are normal and that only police and not the army had their vacation canceled. While he criticized India's \"coercive diplomacy\" and regretted India's \"war hysteria,\" he underscored the fact that the two countries don't want to go to war. Tensions increased between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan following the November 26 attacks in Mumbai, where militants launched a coordinated strike against luxury hotels, a Jewish center and other targets. India has criticized Islamabad for not doing enough to counter terrorism, and it has accused elements within the Pakistan government and military of complicity in fueling terrorism in the region. On Thursday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi warned India to refrain from launching any strikes against Pakistan, according to a report in The Nation newspaper. Another unnamed Pakistani military official told CNN that the Pakistani military has been taking precautionary measures to safeguard borders in the face of mounting military threats from India over the Mumbai attacks. \"Naturally, you have to take certain steps to stem that expected tide of Indian operations,\" he said, \"You can't fight on both fronts so we have redeployed certain military elements from the western border to the northern border to meet Indian operations.\" The official said that while Pakistan has tolerated U.S. missile strikes from Afghanistan into Pakistan, he believes the government and public would not stand for an Indian incursion. In the Indian capital of New Delhi on Friday, three military chiefs briefed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the security situation. An Indian officer said Indian soldiers have spotted Pakistani troop movements along the Line of Control in Kashmir. The Line of Control divides the disputed region between the area controlled by India and the area administered by Pakistan. Indian defense spokesman Sitanshu Kar said India isn't carrying out a troop buildup along its western borders but \"is monitoring the situation closely.\" He also said he is \"not aware\" of military reports about Pakistani troop mobilization along the Indian border. \"But we are keeping a vigil,\" Kar said. Since the division of the subcontinent in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought three wars, including two over the disputed territory of Kashmir -- now wracked by an 18-year, bloody separatist campaign that authorities say has left at least 43,000 dead. There also was a limited border conflict in 1999 between the countries in Kashmir.

Gonzalo Higuain is congratulated after scoring Real Madrid's only goal against Valencia. The win ended Madrid's run of three straight league defeats and moved them up to 29 points, nine behind leaders Barcelona -- who visit Villarreal on Sunday. With captain Raul Gonzalez only on the bench befcause of the flu, Higuain played alone in attack, and he soon made his mark with the early goal -- the Argentine collecting Arjen Robben's pass to fire home his 11th goal of the season. Valencia almost fell two goals behind in the 16th minute when Rafael van der Vaart struck the post with a curling drive. Higuain had a chance to double Madrid's tally in the second-half, but his close-range shot struck the bar. The visitors' hopes were effectively ended when captain Carlos Marchena was sent off  after picking up his second yellow card, for a foul on Robben. The defeat, only Valencia's second of the season after also going down to Barcelona, leaves them on 30 points, just one above Madrid.", "811c6e2aca7949f3be075071c58fc7c5453ae02b": "MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- Bollywood superstar Anil Kapoor has been catapulted into the global spotlight for his award-winning performance as creepy quiz show host Prem Kumar in the smash hit movie \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" Anil Kapoor: \"Slumdog Millionaire is like my story.\" Kapoor talks to CNN's \"My City, My Life\" about \"Slumdog\", his hometown of Mumbai, his own rags to riches rise to stardom and how the recent terror attacks affected the city. CNN: - Did you grow up in Mumbai? Anil Kapoor: I was born in Mumbai, in a suburb named Chembur. In my neighborhood the kids never wore shoes, we always had bare feet. I remember my parents asking me to wear shoes to go and play, but usually I would forget. Usually kids say they want to be doctors or engineers, pilots or businessmen, but I just wanted to be an actor. My father was an assistant director for an Indian film maker and then from being an assistant he became a secretary to one of the big stars. In my childhood I was surrounded by films, actors, film makers, directors and film talk. I would bunk school to watch movies, old English films and Hindi films -- that's how I spent my childhood. And playing cricket! CNN: Mumbai is the home of Bollywood movies -- was that an influence? Anil Kapoor: The influence of the film industry is tremendous over here. Every kid dreams of becoming either an actor or a cricketer. In India, we love film and everybody wants to get into films. \"It's in our bloodstream -- film making, songs, music, everything connected with cinema -- people just love it. \"It's the cheapest form of entertainment and recession or no recession, people just flock to the theaters to watch our movies.\" CNN: Tell me about \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" Anil Kapoor: Slumdog is like my story. I also started from scratch, went from rags to riches. I started in Chembur and I slowly climbed -- God has been kind in that way. CNN: Do you think the film is an accurate portrayal of Mumbai? Anil Kapoor: It's a fairytale -- the story is basically a love story, but shot in a very realistic way and it is very authentic. If there is a traffic jam, he [Danny Boyle] has not created a traffic jam, he has actually shot the traffic jam. If he has gone into the slums it is not choreographed at all. The film is very natural -- whatever you see in \"Slumdog\" is very real -- nothing is exaggerated and nothing is downplayed. Watch Anil Kapoor take CNN on a tour of Mumbai. \u00bb . CNN: Is the portrayal of the slums realistic? Anil Kapoor: It is -- you'll see from the way \"Slumdog Millionaire\" has been shot, it's not portraying misery. You see there is a lot of hope in the kids, a lot of fun and a lot of innocence. There's not a single portion where you feel it has been sensationalized. There is nowhere in the film where you feel they are trying to show misery or poverty. Mumbai is growing and it's a commercial city and you can see that things are changing. These are the realities and we have to face it. We are confident enough to face it, we are not ashamed. CNN: What reaction have you had from family and friends? Anil Kapoor: People are very proud of this film. Generally, the public is happy, the whole country is very happy. It's an Indian story with Indian content and it's great. There are a lot of friends from Britain and USA who want to come to Mumbai, after seeing this film. I happened to talk to Tom Cruise at the Golden Globes and he is very keen to come to Mumbai and visit India. CNN: How have the terror attacks affected the city? Anil Kapoor: The whole country was stunned. Mumbai was coming to a standstill and we started questioning ourselves and the government, asking are we safe enough? What is happening? Is it our fault, their fault? Why cant we take action? It really shook us completely and the tremors are still being felt. People are still angry, people are still upset, still insecure, still scared -- all these emotions are still there. You'll find everything is normal, but internally there is a certain sense of insecurity. See photos of Anil Kapoor in Mumbai \u00bb . CNN: What do you love about the city? Anil Kapoor: It is a city of opportunities. People come here to make it and they get absorbed by it. This city always surprises you; there is something happening constantly, there is a real buzz -- it's pulsating, like a roller coaster ride. You go somewhere outside the city and you feel it is dead compared to Mumbai. When you come to Mumbai you notice its energy, its excitement . Mumbai never sleeps. When I go to London and I want to eat something there is nothing open past 2 a.m., but here at five in the morning everything is open, everything is alive. Here everyone is so full of life, so full of happiness. CNN: What do you do to relax in Mumbai? Anil Kapoor: In Mumbai no one relaxes. People are always on the move -- that's what is relaxing for them. Everybody is working and enjoying themselves and achieving and dreaming. Holidays are also combined with work; the concept of holiday doesn't exist for most people over here. CNN: What's it like being Anil Kapoor going about your business in Mumbai? Anil Kapoor: I've never really felt like a star. I just feel like I'm one of the ordinary people in the city. I cycle around and I'm around in the street sometimes and obviously people meet me and I love meeting people from all walks of life. I just feel like one of them. I love interacting with them, I love meeting them, making friends. Wherever I go I am always available to talk, to listen. I'm a good listener and that's what I do. CNN: Describe the people of Mumbai. Anil Kapoor: The people are very open. It's not that the city's underbelly is hidden away and you can't see it --you see it everyday, you know what the reality is. Everybody who comes to Mumbai adds something to this changing, dynamic city. Mumbai is ancient India with a dynamic presence and it's looking forward to a bright future.", "5990d3a8c994b6efe7b90eaf391d687ed7103619": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ariel Binns is cute, smart, outgoing and looks remarkably like first daughter Sasha Obama. Young model Ariel Binns, right, resembles Sasha Obama. The similarity has not gone unnoticed by the fashion industry. Harper's Bazaar magazine cast the 6-year-old Brooklyn, New York, first-grader with model Tyra Banks in a photo spread showing an African-American family in the White House. Binns, a child model, was peering out from under a big wooden desk in an image reminiscent of John F. Kennedy's time in office. When it comes to fashion there's nothing like a powerful brand to boost sales, especially if that brand is a dynamic first family. \"Marketers are finally waking up to it -- you know -- black is beautiful,\" says global branding expert David Rogers who predicts African-American models will play a more prominent role in fashion photography as a direct result of the Obamas. \"It's just going to become part of the fabric of the fashion imagery of pop culture, which is a great thing,\" says Rogers.  Watch young first daughter look-alike model \u00bb . At Wilhelmina Kids, a modeling agency in New York for kids and teens, agents say there is increased demand for first daughter look-alikes. \"It's a trend because, what little girl doesn't want to emulate the first kids?\" said Marlene Wallach, president of Wilhelmina, which represents Binns. Unlike the Bush twins or Chelsea Clinton, global branding experts say the appeal of the Obama girls is unique -- and infinitely marketable. After the first kids appeared in their J.Crew outfits on Inauguration Day, the company's Web site got so many hits, it crashed. \"The most visible, most exciting family in America is this beautiful black family and so people are ready and looking for those kinds of images,\" says branding expert David Rogers, adding that a lot of Americans want to identify and, \"find some sort of connection with this family.\" There is a downside. The Obamas were not happy when toy manufacturer Ty Inc. came out with African-American dolls named Sweet Sasha and Marvelous Malia even though the company said the dolls did not look like the Obama girls. First lady Michelle Obama's office said it was \"inappropriate to use young private citizens for marketing purposes.\" New York  clinical psychologist Judy Kuriansky says many famous families face similar problems. \"I can certainly understand Michelle Obama being protective of her children. Many celebrities in Hollywood feel that way too. They don't want their children exposed to the public, because once the child is exposed to the public image, not only are they owned, but they could be used in many different ways and it takes away from the child growing up as a normal, average child.\" Still, some say the celebrity of Sasha and Malia has a positive effect by presenting a positive and prominent image of young African-American girls. Asked whether she believes the Obama girls will open up possibilities for her own child, Ariel Binns' mom Dawn Crooks says, \"I think it will. I hope it does.\" As for the overall effect, branding expert Rogers says he believes using look-alikes will take diversity to a whole new level.", "05b497ae445d5f223b4772292ce83009074f2249": "ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Officials monitoring the River Tiber in Rome fear it could break its banks as early as Friday evening after a spate of bad weather in Italy -- but do not expect major flooding. A rescue boat patrols the swollen River Tiber in central Rome early Friday. Guido Bertolaso, the head of the Italian Civil Protection Department said that there is a 20 to 30 percent chance the river could break its banks and cause disruption in some neighborhoods in northern Rome, but not in the historic city center. Two people have died in weather-related incidents elsewhere in Italy. \"We see that the flow is increasing, but it is not reaching a level that could be dangerous for the capital city of Italy,\" said Bertolaso about the Tiber, deeming the situation \"crucial but not serious.\" Bertolaso, calling the situation \"quite extraordinary,\" labeled the flood threat and storms as the \"fifth most serious situation of the past 100 years.\" \"But I think it is under control and the secret is to have the technology and the kind of organization to monitor the situation and to intervene if an emergency arises,\" he said. Bertolaso noted that authorities have been keeping a minute-by-minute watch because of heavy storms over the past few days. He said the water level would probably increase for a few more hours and eventually peak between 8 p.m. and midnight local time Friday (between 1800 and 2200 GMT). \"If there will be no more rain, the situation is expected to stabilize,\" he said. Rome Mayor Gianni Alemanno said he did not expect a major flood and noted that only a few dwellings have been evacuated -- primarily those inhabited by immigrants and Roma, who have set up makeshift camps on the banks of the Tiber. \"I just recommend people to stay at home and not to rush to the river banks to watch the river swelling,\" Alemanno said. Hundreds of volunteers and civil protection officials have been deployed around Rome to monitor the situation, the Civil Protection Department said. Sandbags have been lined up to contain any possible river overflow, and the fire brigade is ready with amphibious vehicles. Police have blocked access to some pedestrian bridges and river banks, while residents are being urged to use their vehicles only if necessary. Firefighters Thursday had to rescue dozens of motorists stranded in their cars. Because of the intense rain, the streets of some northern Rome neighborhoods were already flooded by water and covered in thick brown mud. One woman died near Rome early Thursday when her car was submerged by a wave of water and mud in an underpass.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, celebrates election victories Tuesday night in Washington. According to projections, Democrats in the House were on track Wednesday to increase their majority by at least 18 seats, a margin that would give Obama a formidable tool to push his legislative agenda after his January 20 inauguration. Democrats took at least 22 seats from Republicans in Tuesday's election, with the GOP taking four seats from the Democrats, according to CNN projections. With winners yet to be called for eight of the House's 435 seats, Democrats were projected to win 254 seats, with Republicans having 173. \"I don't know what the final number will be,\" Pelosi said during a Wednesday afternoon news conference on Capitol Hill. \"But it will be well over 250. It's a signal of the change that the American people want.\" Pelosi, D-California, said she hoped Obama would \"bring people together to reach consensus\" on issues that concern Americans. \"A new president must govern from the middle,\" she said. Topping her agenda, she said, would be \"growing the economy, expanding health care, ending dependence on foreign oil and ending the war in Iraq.\" When he woke up Wednesday morning, Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan said, he felt like the boy who stubbed his toe, the character in a quote from President Lincoln, who said: \"It hurts too bad to laugh, and I'm too big to cry.\" Duncan also called on the president-elect to govern from the center and warned that if Democrats moved too far to the left, Republicans could take back seats in the 2010 midterm elections. \"The last two times Democrats controlled the House, Senate and the presidency, they choked on the bone of responsibility,\" he said. \"They lurched far to the left and introduced the country to President Ronald Reagan and Speaker Newt Gingrich.\" Among Tuesday's GOP casualties was longtime Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut, whose reputation for occasionally bucking his party couldn't keep him from losing to Democrat Jim Himes. Shays' defeat leaves New England without any Republicans in the House. Shays was seeking his 11th full term.  Watch Pelosi say Americans voted for change \u00bb . Heading into Election Day, the Democrats had a 235-199 House majority. The Democrats' gains come two years after they took control of the House -- with a gain of 30 seats -- after 12 years in the minority. Here are highlights of other races from Tuesday with projected winners: . Democrats gained at least two seats in Ohio, including that of Rep. Steve Chabot, who was seeking an eighth term in a Cincinnati-area district that normally votes about evenly for GOP and Democratic presidential candidates. CNN projects that Chabot lost to Democrat Steve Driehaus. Just two years earlier, Chabot was re-elected with 52 percent of the vote despite an anti-Republican tide that helped Democrats capture Ohio's governorship and take a U.S. Senate seat. Democrats also gained a seat left open by retiring Rep. Ralph Regula. Democrat John Boccieri defeated the GOP's Kirk Schuring in the northeastern Ohio contest. \u2022 In New York, Democrats won three Republican seats, including two left open by incumbents not seeking re-election. In one of the open races, Democrat Mike McMahon won the last GOP-held seat in New York City, defeating the GOP's Robert Straniere. Democrat Dan Maffei defeated Republican Dale Sweetland, who was trying to win a seat vacated by 10-term GOP Rep. Jim Walsh. In a rematch of a 2006 race, former naval officer Eric Massa beat GOP Rep. Randy Kuhl in a western New York district that generally votes Republican. \u2022 Freshman Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, was projected to survive a race that tightened after she accused Obama of having \"anti-American views.\" She was leading Democratic challenger Elwyn Tinklenberg 47 percent to 43 percent with 86 percent of precincts reporting. Bachmann set off a storm of criticism in October when she said Obama's connection to 1960s radical William Ayers made her concerned that Obama may have anti-American views. Bachmann's comments prompted a flood of fundraising for Tinklenberg. \u2022 In Florida, Democrats captured from Republicans two of the four seats that analysts thought they could win. Democrat Suzanne Kosmas defeated Rep. Tom Fenney, and Democrat Alan Grayson defeated Rep. Ric Keller. However, brothers and Republicans Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Mario Diaz-Balart, who represent districts in southern Florida, held off their Democratic challengers. Lincoln Diaz-Balart won a ninth term, defeating former Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez. \u2022 Democratic incumbents weren't invulnerable in Florida. Rep. Tim Mahoney -- a south-central Florida Democrat elected to replace scandal-plagued GOP Rep. Mark Foley in 2006 -- lost to his Republican challenger, Tom Rooney. Mahoney already was going to have a tough race in his Republican-leaning district. But the race became tougher in mid-October with allegations that Mahoney had an affair with one of his aides and paid her thousands of dollars in hush money. Mahoney admitted to causing \"pain\" in his marriage, but he denied paying the aide to keep quiet. \u2022 Republican incumbents in two California districts maintained their House seats -- Rep. Ken Calvert defeated Democrat Bill Hedrick, a former teacher, and Brian Bilbray defeated Democrat Nicholas \"Nick\" Alexander Leibham, an attorney. In June 2006, Bilbray narrowly won a special election to fill the vacant San Diego seat that once was occupied by disgraced former Rep. Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham. \u2022 In Pennsylvania, Rep. John Murtha handily defeated Republican challenger William Russell. Republicans had hoped to defeat Murtha after he called his western Pennsylvania district \"a racist area\" and \"redneck.\"    \u2022 The House's third-ranking Republican, Rep. Adam Putnam of central Florida, was re-elected but wrote to his colleagues Tuesday night that he wouldn't run again for a leadership post, saying he wanted to return his focus \"to crafting public policy solutions for America's generational challenges.\" He is currently the GOP conference chairman. \u2022 In a heavily Republican district near Houston, Texas, Democratic Rep. Nick Lampson lost his re-election bid against Pete Olson. Lampson won the seat in 2006 after Republican and former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay resigned to fight state money laundering charges. \u2022 In Ohio's 11th District, Democrats easily took a seat that was vacant since the death of Democratic Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones. Democrat Marcia Fudge defeated Republican Thomas Pekarek. Tubbs Jones, who represented the district that covers parts of Cleveland and its suburbs, died in August after brain hemorrhaging caused by an aneurysm. \u2022 The House's first two Muslim members, Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana, won their contests Tuesday. Carson has won his first full term; he had succeeded his grandmother, the late Rep. Julia Carson, in a March special election.  \u2022 There was a party change in the race to represent New Jersey in the House. Democrat John Adler, 48, defeated Republican Chris Myers, 42, a Navy combat veteran. Adler, an attorney, sponsored New Jersey's 2006 law prohibiting smoking in indoor public places and workplaces. He was also the sponsor of a law toughening car emission standards in the state.  \u2022 Democrats took power from Republicans in Idaho, too. Walt Minnick beat Republican William Sali in a race for the House. Minnick has an MBA and law degree from Harvard University and served as a Nixon White House staffer in the early 1970s before starting a 21-year career at a wood-products maker.

A warrant issued for Lindsay Lohan apparently stems from her 2007 drunken driving convictions, police said. Lohan's attorney told CNN the warrant was issued \"out of a misunderstanding.\" It was not known whether she would attend the hearing Monday. The warrant was issued by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge in Beverly Hills, California. It apparently stems from Lohan's 2007 convictions for drunken driving, police said Friday. She is serving three years probation. Sandi Gibbons of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office told CNN on Sunday the warrant is believed to be in connection with a possible probation violation. The district attorney's office prosecuted the original 2007 case, she said. The hearing is set to begin sometime after 8:30 a.m., she said. Lohan \"has the right to appear\" at the hearing, said Alan Parachini, Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman. \"That decision is up to her.\" Lohan's attorney, Shawn Chapman Holley, told CNN on Sunday that she will appear at the hearing on Lohan's behalf. \"Since her case was resolved, Ms. Lohan has been in compliance with all the terms and conditions of her probation and all orders of the court,\" Holley said in a statement. \"The warrant issued on Friday was, in our view, born out of a misunderstanding which I am confident I can clear up next week,\" Holley said. Police said Saturday they were not actively seeking Lohan, as they would not usually go after a person to take them into custody in such cases. Beverly Hills police Sgt. Mike Foxen said on Friday authorities were hoping Lohan would turn herself in. Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on driving under the influence charges, with a cocaine possession charge in the second incident. The first arrest, in May 2007, came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehab facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police saying Lohan was trying to run her down in a car. A judge sentenced Lohan to three years probation after she entered guilty and no contest pleas to the charges. Lohan's acting career, which started at age 10 on a soap opera, took off on the big screen a year later when she played both identical twins in Disney's \"The Parent Trap.\" Since then, she has starred in at least a dozen movies, including \"Georgia Rule\" with Jane Fonda in 2007. Her pop music recording career, boosted by her movie roles, has floundered in the past year. Her last album was released in 2005.

Phil Spector did not testify at his five-month murder trial. The jury said it was split 10-2. The jury deliberated for 12 days, taking six ballots, but was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. Jurors told Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler they were split 10-2, without indicating which way they were leaning. They added there was nothing Fidler could do to help them arrive at a unanimous verdict. Fidler discharged the nine men and three women, thanking them for their service.  Watch what the jurors have to say \u00bb . Spector went on trial in April, charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of B-movie queen Lana Clarkson after a night out in the clubs of Hollywood. The judge told attorneys to return to his Los Angeles, California, courtroom on October 3 to discuss the next legal move. Spector, 67, did not take the witness stand at the trial. Deliberations were arduous, entering the third week on Monday. Last week, jurors received new instructions on the law and were told to start over after the foreman declared the panel was deadlocked 7-5. The jury's inability to reach a verdict capped a five-month trial that played like a Hollywood film noir classic -- with a twist of the bizarre. A 6-foot-tall, blue-eyed blonde with a toothpaste commercial smile, Clarkson was known for her roles in \"Barbarian Queen\" and \"Amazon Women on the Moon.\" But at 40 the parts were few and far between and she had taken a $9-an-hour job as a VIP hostess at the House of Blues in Hollywood. Spector invented the \"wall of sound\" in the 1960s and worked with the Beatles, Ike and Tina Turner and other acts. Normally reclusive, Spector had spent a rare night out on the town, found Clarkson at the House of Blues at closing time and invited her home for a drink in the wee hours of February 3, 2003. After initially turning him down, she agreed to accompany him, according to testimony. Hours later, police were summoned to Spector's mansion in Alhambra, a suburb of Los Angeles. The diminutive music producer had wandered into the driveway in the predawn and told his Brazilian-born chauffeur, \"I think I killed somebody,\" according to the driver's testimony. Clarkson was found inside, slumped in a chair in the foyer. She had been shot in the mouth. A .38-caliber Colt Special revolver lay at her feet. It appeared someone had attempted to clean up the blood with a diaper found in the guest bathroom. Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson  was depressed over a recent breakup, grabbed the gun and  took her own life. But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace, with five women telling harrowing tales on the witness stand of the music producer threatening them with firearms. Spector's driver testified he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, \"I think I killed somebody.\" At issue was whether Spector pulled the trigger -- or whether Clarkson did. In photos projected on a large screen, the gruesome crime scene resembled a set decorated for a horror film. In all, 77 witnesses testified and more than 600 pieces of evidence were submitted. The evidence cart wheeled into the jury room was piled high with exhibits. The jury even toured the scene of the alleged crime. The experts' testimony differed widely on what the physical evidence showed. Prosecutors pointed to the leopard print purse slung over Clarkson's shoulder as evidence she was trying to leave when she was shot. The defense argued that blood-spatter evidence on the white women's jacket Spector wore showed he was standing too far away to place the gun in Clarkson's mouth. Spector hired and fired a who's who of legal talent for his defense. High profile defense attorneys who have left the case include Leslie Abramson and Bruce Cutler. He also changed hairstyles several times during the trial, and wore flamboyant clothing, including frock coats and pastel-colored ties and pocket handkerchiefs.

Roma lost further ground in the race for the fourth Champions League place as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Sampdoria. Julio Baptista gave the visitors a seventh-minute lead but Giampaolo Pazzini headed home an equalizer before the same player put the home side ahead after a mistake from goalkeeper Doni. But Baptista levelled from the spot after Marco Padalino was penalized for fouling Max Tonetto -- the player who missed the decisive spot-kick in the midweek Champions League defeat by Arsenal.", "7974f89f052ee395aab84119635ad5cfbbed7c2a": "(CNN)  -- Josef Fritzl, the Austrian accused of keeping his daughter in a cellar for decades and fathering her seven children, will plead guilty to rape and incest when his trial opens Monday, Fritzl's lawyer told CNN. Josef Fritzl is expected to plead guilty to rape and incest on Monday, his lawyer tells CNN. However, Fritzl will deny other charge he faces: murder, enslavement and assault, attorney Rudolph Mayer said Sunday. The 73-year-old expects to spend the rest of his life in prison, Mayer added. Fritzl faces six charges in a closed-door trial. The trial is scheduled to last five days, but Mayer said it could be shorter. Fritzl was charged in November with incest and the repeated rape of his daughter, Elisabeth, over a 24-year period. But he was also charged with the murder of one of the children he fathered with her, an infant who died soon after birth. State Prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek said Michael Fritzl died from lack of medical care. In all, Fritzl is charged with: murder, involvement in slave trade (slavery), rape, incest, assault and deprivation of liberty, Sedlacek's office said. If convicted, he could face life in prison. Austria does not have the death penalty. \"This man obviously led a double life for 24 years. He had a wife and had seven kids with her. And then he had another family with his daughter, fathered another seven children with her,\" said Franz Polzer, a police officer in Amstetten, the town where Fritzl lived, at the time of his arrest. The case first came to light in April 2008 when Elisabeth's daughter, Kerstin, became seriously ill with convulsions. Elisabeth persuaded her father to allow Kerstin, then 19, to be taken to a hospital for treatment. Hospital staff became suspicious of the case and alerted police, who discovered the family members in the cellar. Fritzl confessed to police that he raped his daughter, kept her and their children in captivity and burned the body of the dead infant in an oven in the house. Elisabeth told police the infant was one of twins who died a few days after birth. When Elisabeth gained her freedom, she told police her father began sexually abusing her at age 11. On August 8, 1984, she told police, her father enticed her into the basement, where he drugged her, put her in handcuffs and locked her in a room. Fritzl explained Elisabeth's disappearance in 1984 by saying the girl, who was then 18, had run away from home. He backed up the story with letters he forced Elisabeth to write. Elisabeth Fritzl and all but three of her children lived in the specially designed cellar beneath her father's home in Amstetten, Austria, west of Vienna. The other three children lived upstairs with Fritzl and his wife; Fritzl had left them on his own doorstep, pretending the missing Elisabeth had dropped them off. Under Austrian law, if Fritzl is convicted on several offenses, he will be given the sentence linked to the worst crime. The charges he faces are: . \u2022 Murder: The infant who died in 1996 died from a lack of medical care, the state prosecutor said. The charge carries a sentence of life in prison. \u2022 Involvement in slave trade: From 1984 until 2008, prosecutors allege, Fritzl held his daughter, Elisabeth, captive in a dungeon, abused her sexually and treated her as if she were his personal property -- in a situation similar to slavery. If he is convicted, the sentence could range from 10 to 20 years in prison. \u2022 Rape: Between August 30, 1984, and June 30, 1989, Fritzl \"regularly sexually abused Elisabeth,\" according to the prosecutor. The sentence could be from five to 15 years in prison. \u2022 Incest: Parallel to the rape charge. It carries a sentence of up to one year. \u2022 Withdrawal of liberty: Three of the children Fritzl had with Elisabeth were illegally held captive in a dungeon with no daylight or fresh air, according to prosecutors. That charge carries a sentence of one to 10 years. \u2022 Assault: Between August 28, 1984, and April 26, 2006, Fritzl repeatedly threatened Elisabeth and their three children with gas and booby traps as warnings in case they tried to escape, authorities allege. The sentence would range from six months to five years.

Various leaders negotiated for years to bring an end to Northern Ireland's \"troubles.\" Culminating in a power sharing deal between Ulster's unionists, led by Ian Paisley, and Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA (nationalists), led by Gerry Adams, the road to peace has been a torturous one characterized by violence, set-backs and numerous false starts. Only recently the Ulster Defence Association, Northern Ireland's largest loyalist group, said it will cease to be an armed paramilitary group, starting at midnight on November 11, saying the \"war is over.\" \"All weaponry will be put beyond use,\" Colin Halliday of the Ulster Political Research Group, which is linked to the group, said in a speech in Belfast aired by RTE, Ireland's state-owned broadcaster. \"The struggle to maintain the union is on a new and more complex battlefield.\" The Irish Republican Army (IRA) disarmed two years ago, helping to restore the province's government in Belfast. Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said the most recent moves of groups to disarm was \"significant and hopefully signals a further step toward the ending of all paramilitarism in Northern Ireland.\" For those that have lived through the turmoil in Northern Ireland, peace achieved though diplomacy must have seemed like an unrealistic goal. After all, each attack by loyalists usually resulted in retaliation by nationalists -- making the dispute bitter and intractable. But diplomacy has worked in bringing peace to Northern Ireland. Credit for developing a framework for the peace process stretches back to former British Prime Minster John Major's rule in the 1990s and efforts by Ireland's Ahern. But it was Major's successor, Tony Blair, who was unrelenting in his quest for peace by making it a major priority of his government. Blair came to Northern Ireland 37 times as Prime Minister, traveling there more often than any of his predecessors as well as hosting many meetings at 10 Downing Street and discussing the peace process while at many international summits. According to the Belfast Telegraph: \"When he (Blair) said on that first day he had come to seek 'a lasting and fair political settlement' it turned out he wasn't spouting platitudes on a stump.\" Journalist James Button, who covered the peace process talks, says: \"Blair played a clever hand. He saw the hardliners had to be involved. \"Critically he judged that the process had to tilt ever so slightly towards the republicans to prevent a split in their ranks and the resumption of violence by radicals -- which had happened whenever the republican leadership had inclined to moderation before.\" Button says Downing Street had a bicycle theory around peace talks: \"They had to keep going forward otherwise they would fall over.\" It was Blair's diplomacy that wooed the previously immovable Paisley. Irish political scientist Lord Bew told the Guardian the alliance with Paisley was Blair's \"last great romance... Once again when we thought the old maestro was fading, his capacity to seduce, politically speaking, is phenomenal.\" But as Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein told CNN, the conflict was primarily a local one that needed to be solved by local people: \"The people who have to be the brokers are the people who live in the areas of conflict. \"They're the people who ought to be the brokers but everybody else from the outside has to enhance the conditions so that those leaders or factions can actually broker not just an agreement, but implement an agreement. \"The Good Friday Agreement -- and [former U.S.] Senator [George] Mitchell said this at the time, when we got the agreement -- \"That's the easy bit. Implementing it is going to be the difficult bit.\" Mitchell worked with the various participants to reach an agreement. The long road to peace . The \"troubles\" have been a centuries-old dispute between England and Ireland over who controls Northern Ireland. In 1609 British colonial settlers confiscated native-owned land in Northern Ireland and settled in Ulster with mainly Protestant British planters. There was conflict between the planters and the native Irish. The planters won the bloody ethno-religious conflicts that followed and cracked down on the political and religious freedoms of the indigenous Irish. In the 1700s groups formed (including the Ulster Orangemen that continue to this day) and antagonisms between the two communities became entrenched. Ireland was incorporated into the UK in 1801 and reformers such as Daniel O'Connell called for the repeal of the union as well as the end of discrimination of Catholics (around 75 percent of the population). The agitation of the Irish Parliamentary Party, who sometimes held the balance of power in Westminster, led to the unionists further entrenching their position for British rule. In 1920 guerilla warfare between what became known as the IRA and Unionists led to the partitioning of southern Ireland and Northern Ireland. Nationalists in Northern Ireland, who numbered around 35 per cent of the population, did not accept legitimacy of the new partition. Between 1970 and 1972 tensions that had been brewing erupted into violence with almost 500 people killed in Northern Ireland. One explanation for this was the formation of the real IRA, which embraced \"armed struggle\" against British rule. Another was the introduction of internment without trial (the vast majority of those imprisoned were Catholic) which succeed in politicizing many into the nationalist cause. Bloody Sunday -- a January 1972 shooting in Derry of 14 unarmed nationalist civil rights activists by the British Army -- was a flashpoint in the conflict. In 1972 the retaliation of the Provos came at a massive cost -- more than 100 soldiers were killed, 500 were wounded and there were 1300 bombings. Yet the nationalists vowed to continue their campaign until there was a united Ireland. Successive British governments failed to solve the \"Irish question\" so the participants settled in for what the IRA called the Long War, which involved sustained, low-level violence, hunger strikes and protests. The stop-start cease-fire . Since the late 1980s Sinn Fein, which compared its struggle to that of the fight for liberation in Palestine and South Africa, has sought a negotiated end to the conflict. Both loyalist and republican paramilitary groups declared a cease-fire after much negotiation. But the peace was fragile and short-lived. The IRA, led by Adams, revoked the cease-fire in 1996 after a bombing at Canary Wharf in London that killed two and caused \u00a385 million worth of damage. In June 1996 a large part of Manchester's city center was destroyed by an IRA bomb that injured 200 people. Splinter groups of the IRA who rejected the notion of a cease-fire continued their campaigns. In August 1998 the Real IRA bombed Omagh, killing 29 civilians. But during the 1990s many world leaders still held out for peace in Northern Ireland. Supporters of talks included the president of the U.S., Bill Clinton, who in 1995 visited Northern Ireland and spoke in Belfast of the \"peace process,\" calling terrorists \"yesterday's men.\" Diplomacy in action . In 1997 newly elected British Prime Minister Tony Blair endorsed a report on decommissioning and the criteria for inclusion in all-party talks. Mo Mowlam, the UK's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, accepted in August 1997 that the IRA cease-fire was genuine and invited Sinn Fein for multi-party talks. On Good Friday, April 10 1998, it was announced that the two governments and political parties in Northern Ireland had reached an agreement to share power. It later emerged that President Clinton had made a number of calls to party leaders to encourage them to reach an agreement. The agreement included a devolved, inclusive government, prisoner release, troop reduction, paramilitary decommissioning, and the addressing of the question of Irish reunification. The definitive end of the peace process -- and the Troubles - came in 2007 following the St Andrews agreement in October 2006 and the March 2007 elections. The Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein formed a government in May 2007 and in July 2007 the British Army formally ended their mission in Northern Ireland, 38 years after their deployment. Today, Northern Ireland is still part of the United Kingdom but the British government has said if there is a majority of votes then a united Ireland will be possible. The key to winning support from the Nationalists/ Republicans was the British Government recognizing the \"Irish Dimension\" -- that the Irish as a whole should have the right to work out the issues between the North and the South, without outside interference. Prosperity and peace . According to an article in the Financial Times, former sectarians have been tamed not only by peace but also by prosperity. \"The little brick houses which rose 56 percent in price in the last year cost more than the English average. There are Japanese restaurants. The locals fly from George Best Airport to their Alpine second homes. These people are, in the local phase, 'recovering sectarians,'\" according to the FT. Aiding this process is the European Union, which is flooding Northern Ireland with funds, believing that the peace and diplomatic process needs to be financially assisted. The European Union's investment, worth 724 million euros (about 1.03 billion U.S. dollars) will be made available through the three programs -- the PEACE III program, the cross-border cooperation program with Ireland and Scotland, and the Regional Competitiveness and Employment program for the province. But peace and prosperity would not have occurred without the success of diplomacy, says Adams. \"There's been a war somewhere in the world for every day of every week of every month of the last few decades and all of them are caused by human beings, mostly by men ... all of them can be resolved through dialogue.\" E-mail to a friend .", "f5e582a43830936471ed30077fc4ec2949be8870": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Zimbabwe police arrested on Friday a magistrate who ordered the release of a senior opposition politician granted bail by the country's High Court, a lawyer said. A Zimbabwean policeman patrols outside the entrance of Mutare Magistrates court. The order to release the politician had been suspended when state lawyers appealed the HIgh Court decision. Trust Maanda, a lawyer in Mutare city about 300 kilometers (186 miles) east of Harare, told CNN by phone that magistrate Livingstone Chipadze had been arrested. \"He is in police custody. The police are saying he ordered the release of Roy Bennett in compliance with the High Court ruling,\" said Maanda. Bennett is the choice of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) for deputy agriculture minister under the power-sharing government formed last month. On Wednesday, Chipadze ordered Bennett be released from a prison in Mutare as had been ruled by the High Court last week. However, that order, which required Bennett to post $2,000 as bail, was suspended after the state filed an appeal with Zimbabwe's Supreme Court. \"I can confirm the arrest, but I will be in position to tell you the charge he will face later,\" said a police official in Mutare over the phone. \"He is likely to go to court on Saturday or Monday. But most magistrates here [in Mutare] have gone on strike over his arrest.\" Chipadze joins Bennett in prison in Mutare. Bennett was arrested on February 13 and is facing charges of possessing arms for the purposes of banditry, terrorism and sabotage. The continued detention of Bennett, an ally of MDC leader and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, is seen by many as a crack in the foundation of the coalition Tsvangirai formed with President Robert Mugabe. Meanwhile, a Zimbabwe High Court judge Friday ordered the immediate release of three human rights activists in state \"safe custody\" to testify against human rights activist Jestina Mukoko, who is facing charges of plotting to topple Mugabe. Opposition MDC activists Fannie Tembo, Lloyd Tarumbwa and Terry Musona have been missing since October last year after they were abducted from their homes under the cover of darkness. Lawyers Chris Mhike and Innocent Chagonda took the state to the High Court in an attempt to win the release the trio. But the state represented by Nelson Mutsonziwa had opposed the application, saying the three would be state witnesses when the trial of Mukoko starts. The MDC lawyers then successfully argued that the three were bread winners for their families and the state had not provided their families with assistance while they are in custody. Delivering the judgment, Justice Ben Hlatswayo said, \"I order the immediate release of Fannie Tembo, Lloyd Tarumbwa and Terry Musona from police custody or the custody of any other state agent. This order stands enforceable notwithstanding the noting or filing of an appeal.\" Relatives of the three who were milling around the High Court could not hide their joy after Mhike told them of Hlatswayo's ruling."}
