      "Question: What is a proxy, and how can I use one?\n",
      "Answer: A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.\n",
      " When a computer connects to the internet, it uses an IP address. This is similar to your home’s street address, telling incoming data where to go and marking outgoing data with a return address for other devices to authenticate. A proxy server is essentially a computer on the internet that has an IP address of its own.\n",
      " How a Proxy Works\n",
      "Because a proxy server has its own IP address, it acts as a go-between for a computer and the internet. Your computer knows this address, and when you send a request on the internet, it is routed to the proxy, which then gets the response from the web server and forwards the data from the page to your computer’s browser, like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge\n",
      " Benefits of a Proxy Server\n",
      " Enhanced security: Can act like a firewall between your systems and the internet. Without them, hackers have easy access to your IP address, which they can use to infiltrate your computer or network.\n",
      " Private browsing, watching, listening, and shopping: Use different proxies to help you avoid getting inundated with unwanted ads or the collection of IP-specific data.\n",
      " Access to location-specific content: You can designate a proxy server with an address associated with another country. You can, in effect, make it look like you are in that country and gain full access to all the content computers in that country are allowed to interact with.\n",

      "Answer: First of all, an obligation is another word for a contract. If you have a contract you must do it because you agreed to. Standard means whatever the majority has decided is the normal thing to do, and ethical conduct is an agreed upon set of rules everyone chooses to follow.\n",
      " Therefor, whatever is obligated goes WAY BEYOND whatever is standard. This means everything and not just ethics.\n",
      " Ethics are a set of agreed upon rules that everyone chooses to follow in order to keep the peace in any group (family, society, work, gathering, etc.). Sort of like going to a family reunion where no one gets along. Everyone agrees to be on their best behavior even though they would rather torment each other. Following some basic ethics (keep your bad thoughts to yourself, be polite, do not talk about stuff that starts fights, etc.) will allow all these people to have a good time, and keep those negative feelings from causing problems. When different social groups come together having an agreed upon set of ethics, that all choose to follow, will help reduce conflicts.\n",

      "Answer: The difference between those who succeed slowly and those who succeed fast can be attributed to several factors, including:\n",
      "Risk tolerance: Those who are willing to take bigger risks are more likely to experience fast success, while those who take smaller, calculated risks may experience slower but steadier success.Timing: Sometimes success is simply a matter of being in the right place at the right time. Those who are able to identify and capitalize on opportunities quickly may experience faster success.Persistence: Success often requires persistence and the ability to overcome obstacles. Those who are able to persevere through setbacks and failures may experience slower but steady success.Network: Building a strong network of contacts and supporters can help accelerate success. Those who are able to build strong relationships with others in their industry or field may experience faster success.Focus: Maintaining a clear focus and direction can also help accelerate success. Those who are able to remain focused on their goals and avoid distractions may experience faster success.\n",

In fact, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the North Tower (1 WTC) and South Tower (2 WTC), respectively, at a relatively low altitude, around the 80th-90th floors.\n",

However, the combination of factors, including the massive damage, the intense fires, and the weakening of the structural columns, ultimately led to the collapse of both towers.\n",

      "Here's a brief summary of what happened:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The impact of the planes caused significant damage to the structures, including the destruction of critical columns and the displacement of fireproofing materials.\n",
      "2. The fires that erupted from the impact spread rapidly throughout the buildings, fueled by the large amount of fuel on board the planes and the presence of flammable materials in the buildings.\n",
      "3. The intense heat from the fires weakened the structural steel columns, causing them to sag and lose their load-carrying capacity.\n",
      "4. As the columns weakened, the floors above them began to collapse, which in turn caused the collapse of the entire structure.\n",
      "5. The collapse of the North Tower occurred at around 10:28 a.m., and the South Tower followed at around 9:59 a.m.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that the collapse of the World Trade Center towers was a complex and multifaceted event, and it's not accurate to simplify it to a single cause or factor. The investigation into the 9/11 attacks concluded that the combination of the plane impacts, fires, and structural damage ultimately led to the collapse of the buildings.\n",
