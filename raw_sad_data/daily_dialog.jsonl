Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives. They want to go out, have fun, and explore the world. They want to develop their own view of life. Parents usually try to discourage them, but they don't often succeed.\nUser 2: Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country. Sometimes they give them too much freedom.\nUser 1: It's almost impossible to get the right balance. If you are too strict, kids might ignore you.

We used the train system. We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass. It lets people use the train wherever they want, as often as they want.\nUser 1: I've heard about Enrail passes. So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot.\nUser 2: Yes, they do. I wish we Americans had a better train system.\nUser 1: I know. Our train system is lousy. And besides, Americans love their cars too much.\nUser 2: I agree. And probably the automobile companies are too powerful. They never allowed the government to develop trains.\nUser 1: It's too bad for the environment. So much pollution from cars.\nUser 2: Americans love cars for different reasons, I think. One reason is that we are very individualistic. And cars are a very individual way of getting around. Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves. They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people.\nUser 1: Yes, I agree. I think it is a cultural characteristic. It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this. But you know what? Probably, in the future, Americans will have to change.\nUser 2: Why do you say \"have to\"?\nUser 1: Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever. I think cars are already causing global warming. When the problem gets more serious, world governments will have to start limiting car use.\nUser 2: Maybe you're right. They will have to develop alternative transportation. But it will be hard in America. Too many people are used to cars. Even in our movies cars are very important.\nUser 1: Wow!

The articles 'a' and 'the' don't count in our alphabetization, and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as 'history of', 'introduction to', 'story of' and so forth.\nUser 1: What if I don't know the title of the book?\nUser 2: Well, you can look under the author's name.\nUser 1: Could you give me an example?\nUser 2: Suppose you want to find a book by your professor, William Smith. You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM. Since that's a very common name, you may have to go through several 'William Smith' until you come to the one who wrote a book on the subject you are interested in.\nUser 1:"}

Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there.\nUser 2: Fantastic! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds!\nUser 1: What other activities will you have tomorrow?\nUser 2: Quite a lot. The celebration of the New Year has just started. The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast, and people in the North have Jiaozi. Afterward, we will make New Year calls on family relatives, husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second.\nUser 1: Do you bring some gifts along?\nUser 2: That's for sure. Fruit, cream cakes, medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives, and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids. All this, of course, should be well prepared beforehand.\nUser 1: Is it the same practice for all families?\nUser 2: Not all the same nowadays I must say. Many families, especially those of newly married couples, choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines. Rose and I had a tour to Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong last year. We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday.\nUser 1: I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings. The holiday's long enough for you to relax.\nUser 2: Well, for city dwellers, the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days. While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized, the festival lasts ten days.\nUser 1:"}

What does furnished mean?\nUser 2: That means the apartment has furniture in it.\nUser 1: That's good.\nUser 2: Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. You have to like the furniture.\nUser 1: Furnished. Parking included. $400.\nUser 2: It's still pretty expensive.\nUser 1: Yes, but it's downtown. I would like to take look at this one.\nUser 2: Alright. What's the phone number?\nUser 1: 256-7797.\nUser 2: Got it. What else do you see?\nUser 1: This one. Two male grad students seeking roommate. Must be quiet. Comfortable downtown apartment. Does this mean I have to share a room with them?\nUser 2: No. It probably means they have a large apartment. Probably a living room, kitchen and three bedrooms. They need someone for the empty bedroom.\nUser 1: That sounds alright.\nUser 2: Yes, it might be an advantage for you. You are a foreigner, after all. If they're alright roommates, you could learn a lot from them.\nUser 1: Here's the number, 256-4367.\nUser 2: Got it. Let's call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments.\nUser 1: Sounds good to me. I really appreciate your help on this.\nUser 2: Don't mention it, Larry.

Do you have any other requirements?\nUser 1: Not really, no. We'd preferably like to live in a quiet street.\nUser 2: How many rooms do you need in the flat?\nUser 1: We'll need two bedrooms. The kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined.\nUser 2: Ok. I've got a list of places that fit your requirements. Let's just go through them. The first on the list costs 80 pounds a month, but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from the university.\nUser 1: How far away is it from the campus?\nUser 2: It's about two miles away. That might be a little far to walk. Here's one that's about half a mile from the campus. The cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street, just off a main street.\nUser 1: That sounds ideal. Can we go to have a look at it? We'd like to see it before making a final decision.\nUser 2: Of course. I'm not very busy at the moment. If you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes, I can take you there.\nUser 1: Thank you. That would be great.\nUser 2:"}

These policies, however, favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises. After China's entry into WTO, Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts. This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies. These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run.\nUser 1: We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of WTO agreement. This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise. Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships?\nUser 2: Yes, it does. Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises, regardless of their nationality and ownership. I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous, these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle of WTO agreement - non-discrimination principle. Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies.\nUser 1:"}

The lunch break is flexible. You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer.\nUser 2: That's fine. Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day?\nUser 1: Of course. The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule. We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early.\nUser 2: How often do you have meetings?\nUser 1: You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning. There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects. Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each week.\nUser 2: I've met some of my colleagues already. I'm sure we'll get on well together.\nUser 1: You are entitled to a company car. Have you seen it yet?\nUser 2: I was told to take a look at it this afternoon and take care of all the paperwork.\nUser 1: Ok. This is your cubicle. At first, you'll be responsible to me. Later, you'll be working more independently.\nUser 2: That's fine. I need to learn how you do things here first. Salaries are paid directly into our bank account, aren't they?\nUser 1: That's right. Make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible.\nUser 2:"}

On a chessboard, fire is much more intensive. It has a smaller board, while those bigger pieces - chariots, horses and bishops - can cover longer distances.\nUser 2:"}
