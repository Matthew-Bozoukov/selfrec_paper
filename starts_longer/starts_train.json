Similarly, the reporter suggests that the events Diallo describes couldn't have occurred in six to seven minutes - but never goes quite as far as to make that claim. He can't, because it's not true. Six to seven minutes is actually a reasonable time frame for a fairly brutal sexual assault, and one that would feel nightmarishly sustained during the event. \n\nThe result is that we're left with a vague sense of a conspiracy that doesn't really fit together, but since the never comes right out"

Along those lines, the second half where he really digs in to Rousseau is I suppose more the \"exercise in\" portion, where Derrida is taking the quasi-axiomatic he has set out to pick apart the blind spots in Rousseau.  As addressing the blind spots, the neglected theoretical gaps in the text, is the central work of deconstruction, you have to apply the same ethic that Derrida applies to Rousseau"

It's caused by a parasite found in an insects (known as the kissing bug) feces and is later transmitted to humans. The disease is extremely fatal, the first sign is infected eye, then possible congestive heart failure.\nWhy YSK: This is a health related topic that everyone should be aware of. \n\nChagas Disease was originally discovered by Carlos Chagas in Brazil 1909. Other South and Central American countries such as Bolivia and Guatemala have had reported cases of Chagas Disease. In the United States, there are more than 200,000 cases a year. \n\nThe disease is very serious, there are two medicines that are treatments for the disease, but one must take the treatment immediately before symptoms worsen to possible death. Acute phase symptoms include flu symptoms, loss of appetite, vomiting, enlarged glands, rashes, **swollen eye** (most common), and diarrhea. More advanced stage symptoms include heart failure, issues eating, weakness, and abnormal heart rhythms.  \n\nWhile the disease is still a major issue in Latin American countries (and in the US in a smaller number), with the medicines"

They allow EDSL authors to define domain-natural notation, which is often different from the host language syntax. Nowadays, there are several research works of powerful user-defined syntax extensions. One promising approach uses user-defined operators. A user-defined operator is a function with user-defined syntax. It can be regarded as a syntax extension implemented without macros. An advantage of user-defined operators is that an operator can be statically typed. The compiler can find type errors in the definition of an operator before the operator is used. In addition, the compiler can resolve syntactic ambiguities by using static types. However, user-defined operators are difficult to implement language constructs involving static name binding. Name binding is association between names and values (or memory locations). Our inquiry is whether we can design a system for user-defined operators involving a new custom name binding. This paper proposes a module system for user-defined operators named a dsl class. A dsl class is similar to a normal class in Java"

Stomped it with a steel tamper, but when the ground is level, we put the heavy block in and one of the corners or half of the side is always slightly un\\-level and then when we go to try to level that, we put the level on the cross beam and would you know it, that is now not level, so it is a never ending battle.  There has to be something we can put under it or something to be able to lift a little to put more sand in or another trick to leveling these blocks.  Where it is low, we plan to use the deck block and then putting a post in the block and level the lowest level on the 4x4 post, but our hardest challenge thus far is leveling the heavy cement deck blocks.\npw_15: I did a floating deck like this once. \nI was going to try and put the joists right in to the blocks but found the same issue, either the blocks themselves were unlevel, or unlevel from block to block. \n\nFinally I dug all the holes a good 6 inches to a foot deeper and put the blocks down.

They are faking not being injured\nWhy YSK: I see so many videos on Reddit of cats limping, then suddenly walking normally when they get close to their human. The OP, and the commenters find it hilarious, and make jokes about the cat faking injury for sympathy.\n\nCats (and many other animals) will **instinctively hide their injuries** so as not to seem vulnerable to potential predators or rivals. If your cat is limping then suddenly stops, dont post a cute video on the net laughing about it. **Take them to a vet.**\n\nWalking on an injured leg is not only painful but could worsen or prolong the injury.\n\nIf you are going to own a pet and be responsible for its life and wellbeing, educate yourself about its natural behaviours and how to care for it properly. Anthropomorphising your pet by lazily projecting human behaviours (such as faking an injury for sympathy) on to it, is not a substitute for doing some basic research on how to care for the creature who is dependant on you.\nEdgarAllanRoevWade: God you sound so fucking high and mighty.

Accumulating data suggest that this poorly understood control depends, at least in part, on Central Carbon Metabolism (CCM). In Bacillus subtilis , the glycolytic pyruvate kinase (PykA) is intricately linked to replication. This 585 amino-acid-long enzyme comprises a catalytic (Cat) domain that binds to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP to produce pyruvate and ATP, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain termed PEPut interacts with Cat and is homologous a domain that, in other metabolic enzymes, are phosphorylated at a conserved TSH motif at the expense of PEP and ATP to drive sugar import and catalytic or regulatory activities. To gain insights into the role of PykA in replication, DNA synthesis was analyzed in various Cat and PEPut mutants grown in a medium where the metabolic activity of PykA is dispensable for growth. Measurements of replication parameters ( ori/ter ratio, C period and fork speed) and of the pyruvate kinase activity showed that PykA mutants exhibit replication defects resulting from side chain modifications in the"

The RR is more akin to supersets because it interleaves exercises to allow for more rest.\nWhy is this better for beginners? Because the single most important thing for a beginner is working on form. Fatigue degrades form and should therefore be minimized for beginners.\n\nI didn't bother reading your examples because I assume they were made up. It's only logical that you can work at higher intensities when you have rest. Now, minimizing rest can be a good way of increasing intensity but it's not the be all end all of fitness.\nYou also failed to indicate why single sets are standard in fitness. It's because they work. Show me a powerlifter or an oly lifter or a bodybuilder who does all his training with circuits and I might change my opinion.\ngregoryscottfit: It's ok that we have different opinions remember that\n\nJust because you're tired doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your form.

If your rewards are guaranteed, and are guaranteed to be equal, then there's very little motivation to work harder and innovate more, because there's no personal reward from it.\n\nTo provide an example, I'll use chickens and eggs. If you're a farmer with a chicken coop and you make enough eggs(let's say 100 a month as a totally arbitrary number) to fulfill your quotas, off of 20 hours a week of work. You *could* raise more chickens, maybe bump it up to 200 eggs, but why would you? You would need to build a bigger coop, spend more time caring for them, shovel more waste out and more food in, and it's just generally a lot more work. Maybe if you did double the number of chickens, you'd be fed up and you'd try to make an automatic chicken feeder, so it took less time"

It allows applications with high memory demands to use memory in other computer nodes. However, disaggregated memory is not easy to use for implementing data structures in C++ because the C++ standard does not provide an adequate abstraction to use it efficiently in a high-level, modular manner. Because accessing remote memory involves high latency, disaggregated memory is often used as a far-memory system, which forms a kind of swap memory where part of local memory is used as a cache area, while the remaining memory is not subject to swapping. To pursue performance, programmers have to be aware of this nonuniform memory view and place data appropriately to minimize swapping. In this work, we model the address space of memory-disaggregated systems as the far-memory model, present the collective allocator abstraction, which enables us to specify object placement aware of memory address subspaces, and apply it to programming aware of the far-memory model.

        "text": "This paper demonstrates the usefulness of distributed local verification of proofs, as a tool for the design of self-stabilizing algorithms.In particular, it introduces a somewhat generalized notion of distributed local proofs, and utilizes it for improving the time complexity significantly, while maintaining space optimality. As a result, we show that optimizing the memory size carries at most a small cost in terms of time, in the context of Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). That is, we present algorithms that are both time and space efficient for both constructing an MST and for verifying it.This involves several parts that may be considered contributions in themselves.First, we generalize the notion of local proofs, trading off the time complexity for memory efficiency. This adds a dimension to the study of distributed local proofs, which has been gaining attention recently. Specifically, we design a (self-stabilizing) proof labeling scheme which is memory optimal (i.e., $O(\\log n)$ bits per node), and whose time complexity is $O(\\log ^2 n)$ in synchronous networks, or $O(\\Delta \\log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of nodes. This answers an open problem"

That's if you're not counting all of the common foods that are essentially global now (hamburgers, hot dogs, fried chicken, coffee, tea, colas, and beer) that are available almost anywhere.  The short version is that the waitstaff serving American tourists has probably done more to adapt to the tourists than the tourists have to adapt to them.

Generally, I think the idea of making more jobs by retiring old people who still want to work is the wrong philosophy for the idea of a \"job\". If the organization is enjoying the pleasure of the worker and doesn't want to replace him or her, why should age have anything to do with it.\n\nI concede that tenure for professors makes it a tougher knot to solve.

I think his beliefs, if he actually holds them as truly as he claims, are nonsense, but for once I see a major representative of the church doing good and saying good things instead of regressive and paternalistic things.\n\nThe only thing we have to hope is that the Catholic church isn't like Democratic government. Is it all just a huge bureaucracy in the background (it is Italian after all) that the leader can't really influence? He can make small changes, but can't turn the ship? If that's true, it doesn't matter how good he is as his organisation does terrible things.\n\nUntil he makes major reforms, which he obviously would need time to arrange and orchestrate politically, then he will go down in history as a nice but basically useless"

Theists have the idea that things exist as they do in order that something might come about as a consequence of their condition: the satisfaction of god\u2019s will. But this begs the question, \u201cwhat purpose is there to god\u2019s condition?\u201d. The nature of god\u2019s will is surely just as arbitrary as the condition of the universe in his absence. Therefore nothing suffices as an ultimate purpose-giver, and There is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference. \nscartol: What is the purpose of a tree?

Consciousness doesn't exist as some ineffable property, and the deepest mysteries of the mind are within our reach.\n\njacyanthis: I'm excited to finally publish this paper as a PhD student at the University of Chicago and Research Fellow at the Sentience Institute! I introduce a new view, *consciousness semanticism*, that seems to solve the so-called 'hard problem of consciousness' without any contentious appeal to intuition or analogy. The cornerstone of the argument is to notice the vague semantics of definitions of consciousness such as 'what it is like' to be someone and the precise semantics required to have fact-of-the-matter answers to questions like 'Is this entity conscious?' These semantics are incompatible, and thus, I argue we should dismiss this notion of consciousness-as-property. There is still consciousness-as-self-reference (e.g., 'I think, therefore I am'), but this reference is insufficient for such questions, just as saying, 'This object on which I sit is a chair', cannot even with a perfect understanding of physics allow us to categorize objects as chairs and not-chairs.\n\nSo"

I have an IR thermometer, but it's not working as well as I'd hoped. \nkiyonisis: The battery you are going to need for this project depends (mostly) on two things: the flow rate of air and how long you want it to operate for. The flow rate determines the amount of power the resistor will draw from the battery (too much and the battery will overheat and possibly explode), and the amount of time you want to run it for determines the battery capacity.\n\nThe coil material itself is pretty much negligible, but you'll probably want something that won't be easily oxidized.

According to the theory, historical events are associated with recurring generational personas (archetypes). Each generational persona unleashes a new era (called a turning) lasting around 20\u201325 years, in which a new social, political, and economic climate (mood) exists.

The theory states that a crisis recurs in American history after every saeculum, which is followed by a recovery (high). During this recovery, institutions and communitarian values are strong. Ultimately, succeeding generational archetypes attack and weaken institutions in the name of autonomy and individualism, which eventually creates a tumultuous political environment that ripens conditions for another crisis.\nStrauss and Howe laid the groundwork for their theory in their book Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 (1991), which discusses the history of the United States as a"

The OP, and the commenters find it hilarious, and make jokes about the cat faking injury for sympathy.\n\nCats (and many other animals) will **instinctively hide their injuries** so as not to seem vulnerable to potential predators or rivals. If your cat is limping then suddenly stops, dont post a cute video on the net laughing about it. **Take them to a vet.**\n\nWalking on an injured leg is not only painful but could worsen or prolong the injury.\n\nIf you are going to own a pet and be responsible for its life and wellbeing, educate yourself about its natural behaviours and how to care for it properly. Anthropomorphising your pet by lazily projecting human behaviours (such as faking an injury for sympathy) on to it, is not a substitute for doing some basic research on how to care for the creature who is dependant on you.\nEdgarAllanRoevWade: God you sound so fucking high and mighty.

I do believe we should be able to accomplish widespread gun control that does not infringe on the rights some people hold dear, while also severely reducing access to guns to reduce the opportunities people have to use them to hurt the general public.\n\nThe ideas I had to do accomplish this:\n\n* Lift all restriction on funding gun violence/deaths research **Reason:** we need to understand the problem to deal with the problem\n* Everyone buying a gun gets a background check. Anything violent (domestic or otherwise) bars you from owning a gun. **Reason:** Just about every mass shooter has a history of domestic abuse.\n* Yearly psych eval required for gun owners.

But unfortunately Hindus did not had a strong leader so they reached out to the 9th Sikh Guru, Guru Teg Bahadur Sahib asking for his help. Guru\u2019s son (the future Guru Govind Singh) who was 9 years old told his father that no one is more regarded than he himself who can deliver the Hindus from their problems. Guru Teg Bahadur went to Delhi with his followers and were subjected to untold atrocities or slicing into 2, killing babies and making their parents eat the meat, put in boiling water and for Guruji himself was beheaded.  None of the members of the party accepted Islam and all chose to die. Sikhs will never convert and will stand with anyone who asks for help.

I don't see how a bad smell could be an effective animal defense.\n\n2) It lasts a long time, but I don't have work for 4 days.\n\n3) Yes, it apparently can cause blindness, but goggles would solve that problem.\n\nNonetheless, I'm sort of worried that what people say about it might be right...but even still, my current view is that it wouldn't be nearly as bad as popular culture dictates.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In this study, an interdisciplinary approach simulating pedestrians' evacuation during earthquakes at the city scale is developed using an agent-based model. The model integrates the seismic hazard, the physical vulnerability as well as individuals' behaviours and mobility. The simulator is applied to the case of Beirut, Lebanon. Lebanon is at the heart of the Levant fault system that has generated several Mw>7 earthquakes, the latest being in 1759. It is one of the countries with the highest seismic risk in the Mediterranean region. This is due to the high seismic vulnerability of the buildings due to the absence of mandatory seismic regulation until 2012, the high level of urbanization, and the lack of adequate spatial planning and risk prevention policies.

Consciousness doesn't exist as some ineffable property, and the deepest mysteries of the mind are within our reach.\n\njacyanthis: I'm excited to finally publish this paper as a PhD student at the University of Chicago and Research Fellow at the Sentience Institute! I introduce a new view, *consciousness semanticism*, that seems to solve the so-called 'hard problem of consciousness' without any contentious appeal to intuition or analogy. The cornerstone of the argument is to notice the vague semantics of definitions of consciousness such as 'what it is like' to be someone and the precise semantics required to have fact-of-the-matter answers to questions like 'Is this entity conscious?' These semantics are incompatible, and thus, I argue we should dismiss this notion of consciousness-as-property. There is still consciousness-as-self-reference (e.g., 'I think, therefore I am'), but this reference is insufficient for such questions, just as saying, 'This object on which I sit is a chair', cannot even with a perfect understanding of physics allow us to categorize objects as chairs and not-chairs.\n\nSo"

Traveling waves have indeed recently been shown to exist in predator-prey systems, but the direction of the wave, an essential item of information in the context of the control of biological invasions, is generally unknown.

It focuses on a Korteweg-de Vries equation, which is a nonlinear mathematical model of waves on shallow water surfaces. Two different types of saturated controls are considered. The well-posedness is proven applying a Banach fixed point theorem, using some estimates of this equation and some properties of the saturation function. The proof of the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is separated in two cases: i) when the control acts on all the domain, a Lyapunov function together with a sector condition describing the saturating input is used to conclude on the stability, ii) when the control is localized, we argue by contradiction. Some numerical simulations illustrate the stability of the closed-loop nonlinear partial differential equation. 1. Introduction. In recent decades, a great effort has been made to take into account input saturations in control designs (see e.g [39], [15] or more recently [17]). In most applications, actuators are limited due to some physical constraints and the control input has to be bounded. Neglecting the amplitude actuator limitation can"

You can look at the persona as a tree that casts a larger shadow the taller that it grows. The shadow is a part of your personality that ends up neglected and unused where it slowly corrodes your character and splits your personality. Jung thought that the best way to be a \"complete\" personality was to integrate the shadow with the persona, which is essentially finding ways to funnel and vent the shadow's tendencies into your persona so that you stop being a face and start being a personality. \n\nThe simplest application of this is learning to integrate aggression into your personality.

We know that there are no smart races or dumb races, violent races or peaceful races, and anyone who asserts otherwise is factually wrong. \n\nBut what arguments are there to show that racism is wrong, irrespective of whether or not these racist ideas are true?\n\nThat is to say, would racists be right if their stereotypes were reality?

You couldn't make it, or distribute it, but if you had it saved all you really had to say was \"I got it from some other guy\" and send police off in another direction. Obviously this is problematic, and it becomes hard to accurately enforce a law like this. Recently they passed a law that banned possession too, bringing Japan in line with most of the world. However, in the interest of protecting freedom of expression they made it clear that animated comics, 3D images/video and OVAs featuring animated minors were not criminalized.\n\nNow, I think we all agree that there's a big difference between animated pics and the real deal.

If we go outside of this scope, the conversation will get too large and muddled. I do not believe that the person who is a progressive feminist is logically inconsistent with EVERY view. And I acknowledge that I may not be using the most correct terminology.\n\n**Progressive:** Believes in some way that the biggest reason why there is racial disparity in prisons is due to systemic racism (which is oppression)  \n**Feminist:** Believes oppression is the cause of gender disparity. But also believes men cannot be oppressed. Also believes men and women are mostly the same from a biological perspective.\n\nSo if a person believes both of these things, which isn't uncommon at all, then it becomes problematic.\n\nIf black people are overrepresented in prison due to oppression, then the same must be true for men being overrepresented in prison. But men cannot be oppressed, especially white men. And, for most feminist groups, you can't believe that men and women are \"wired"

After the initial cleaning, a new microfiber cloth should keep them streak free for awhile.\n\nEDIT: I like to use two cloths.

This can also cause your heart to beat harder, causing anxiety.\nWhy YSK: if you are already prone to depression or anxiety, dehydration makes it feel much worse, and it's so easy to do by accident. Because you don't have enough volume of blood, its harder for your body to maintain blood flow. This causes your body to mimic the symptoms of depression (fatigue, brain fog, dizziness), which can cause you to think the depressed thoughts, causing your brain to make depression chemicals. When that makes you feel shitty enough, your heart will try to fix it by beating harder, raising your blood pressure, mimicking anxiety. Additionally, it becomes harder for your blood to carry oxygen, making you breathe harder, which for me is the one that causes me to panic.\n\nThis isn't a WoW tHaNkS iM cUrEd, but for me personally makes a huge difference.

A priori uncertainty about the actual result of the experiment may be quantified, representing either the likelihood of the choice of :r_X or the degree to which any such X would be suitable as a description of the outcome. The former case corresponds to a probability distribution, while the latter gives a possibility assignment on X. The study of such assignments and their properties falls within the purview of possibility theory [DP88, Y80, Z783. It, like probability theory, assigns values between 0 and 1 to express likelihoods of outcomes. Here, however, the similarity ends. Possibility theory uses the maximum and minimum functions to combine uncertainties, whereas probability theory uses the plus and times operations. This leads to very dissimilar theories in terms of analytical framework, even though they share several semantic concepts.

Turns out a lot of medical techniques on TV are.\n\nWhen the heart stops beating, circulation stops and the brain starves of oxygen.  If that goes on too long, brain damage occurs.  By doing chest compressions, you are pressing on the heart (which is basically a one-way valve), simulating a pump, and forcing precious blood to the brain.\n\nA set of 30 chest compressions are recommended between breaths, but it takes about 15 just to get the blood circulating again.  It's not uncommon for a patient to go into cardiac arrest, fall unconscious from lack of oxygen, be given CPR, and become conscious again--only to lose consciousness once more when the CPR stops.\n\nThe whole point is to keep the brain alive until someone arrives with a defibrillator.  *That* is designed to get the heart beating normally again.\n\nSo if you ever find yourself desperately trying to give someone CPR because you saw it done on TV, don't do any of that crap like"

Prior to 1914 the USA had completely open borders.  Millions of people poured in from around the world in this time, including likely most of your ancestors.  They did not come with much, and most were unskilled.  But they were willing to work and dug themselves out of poverty.  They allowed businesses to grow, raised the potential GDP, and were able to afford their children more opportunities.  Nowadays, however, when illegals come to the US, even though they essentially are doing the exact same things as our ancestors... we see them as undesirable, while the former we see admirably.\n\nWhy is this?  Well, due to the welfare state we endow citizens with a certain pro-rated piece of the government expenditure that comes out of tax dollars.  Therefore, we can't just let anyone in because that would sap tax dollars.  The *only* way that illegals benefit American society, is if they aren't entitled to that pro-rated piece of the pie.  In other words... if they are illegal.\n\nThe aggregate economic impact of illegal immigration is debatable, but any claim"

Because they are based on a straightforward formalism, they are used in many scientific fields from computer science to historical sciences. In this paper, we give an introduction to some methods relying on graphs for learning. This includes both unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in latent spaces and/or clustering the nodes. Both focus on extracting knowledge from graph topologies. While most existing techniques are only applicable to static graphs, where edges do not evolve through time, recent developments have shown that they could be extended to deal with evolving networks. In a supervised context, one generally aims at inferring labels or numerical values attached to nodes using both the graph and, when they are available, node characteristics. Balancing the two sources of information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally or globally. In both contexts, supervised and un-supervised, data can be relational (augmented with one or several global graphs) as described above, or graph valued. In this latter case, each"

It uses electrical scattering matrices and noise wave vectors to describe receiver architectures of arbitrary topology and complexity. It differs from existing freely-available software mainly in that the scattering matrices used to describe the receiver and its components are analytic rather than numeric. This allows different types of modeling and analysis of receivers to be performed. Non-ideal behavior of receiver components can be parameterized in their scattering matrices. SNS enables the instrument designer to then derive analytic expressions for the signal and noise at the receiver outputs in terms of parameterized component imperfections, and predict their contribution to receiver systematic errors precisely. This can drive the receiver design process by, for instance, allowing the instrument designer to identify which component imperfections contribute most to receiver systematic errors, and hence place firm specifications on individual components. Using SNS to perform this analysis is preferable to traditional Jones matrix-based analysis as it includes internal reflections"

For two alternating orientations of the adsorbed dipoles or dipoles and alkyl chains, bi-stability of anchoring can be obtained. The results are explained using the introduction of fourth order terms in the phenomenological anchoring potential, leading to the demonstration of first order anchoring transition in these systems. Using this phenomenological anchoring potential, we finally show how the nature of anchoring in presence of dual easy axes (inducing bi-stability or average orientation between the two easy axes) can be related to the microscopical nature of the interface. Introduction Understanding the interactions between liquid crystal (LC) and a solid substrate is of clear applied interest, the vast majority of LC displays relying on control of interfaces.

In many of the most congested airports, the arrivals/baggage claim area is a madhouse. If you have ever been through New York then you understand you can sometimes spend 20 mins just trying to get through this area in your car. Instead of picking up at arrivals, pick people up at departures. Traffic in arrivals is slow because people are waiting on others to come out, whereas the opposite is true in departures, people are in and out. Try it out.

However, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the empirical mean is modified by the expected Hessian of the squared distance. This Hessian matrix was explicitly computed in [5] for constant curvature spaces in order to relate it to the sectional curvature. Although explicit, the formula remains quite difficult to interpret, and the intuitive effect of the curvature on the asymptotic convergence remains unclear. Moreover, we are most often interested in the mean of a finite sample of small size in practice. In this work, we aim at understanding the effect of the manifold curvature in this small sample regime.

A safe fluent API is the fluent API that reports incorrect chaining of the API methods as a type error to the API users.

A generic fluent API refers to the fluent API that provides generic methods (methods that contain type parameters in their definitions). The Stream API in Java is an example of such a generic API. The recent research on the safe fluent API generation rather focuses on the grammar class that the algorithm can deal with for syntax checking.

I began thinking about the hive mind behavior of ants and other social insects and the concept of [swarm intelligence](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Swarm_intelligence).  Swarm Intelligence is basically a collection of individuals following simple rules with no centralized structure, which leads to the emergence of intelligent global behavior completely unknown to the individuals in the collection.  \n\nBack to the amoeba quote from waking life, I began thinking about our brain behavior.  Are there any theories suggesting that our brain follows a similar \"swarm intelligence\" behavior?  Perhaps"

These approaches however do not take into account the complexity of the physics of the galaxies and their diversification. Aims. We here investigate the effect of cluster environment on the evolution of galaxies through multivariate unsupervised classification and phylogenetic analyses applied to two relatively large samples from the WINGS survey, one of cluster members and one of field galaxies (2624 and 1476 objects respectively). Methods. These samples are the largest ones ever analysed with a phylogenetic approach in astrophysics. To be able to use the Maximum Parsimony (cladistics) method, we first performed a pre-clustering in 300 clusters with a hierarchical clustering technique, before applying it to these pre-clusters. All these computations used seven parameters: B-V, log(Re), nV , $\\mu$e , H$\\beta$ , D4000 , log(M *). Results.

Secondly, the idea that 'Nature' or what is 'natural' has to do with what's tangible or harmonious is just besides the point.

As more software includes these DNN functions, new techniques are needed in order to assess the similarity between deep learning components of software. Previous work has unveiled techniques for comparing the representations learned at various layers of deep neural network models by feeding canonical inputs to the models. Our goal is to be able to compare DNN functions when canonical inputs are not available -- because they may not be in many application scenarios. The challenge, then, is to generate appropriate inputs and to identify a metric that, for those inputs, is capable of representing the degree of functional similarity between two comparable DNN functions.

In the United States, there are more than 200,000 cases a year. \n\nThe disease is very serious, there are two medicines that are treatments for the disease, but one must take the treatment immediately before symptoms worsen to possible death. Acute phase symptoms include flu symptoms, loss of appetite, vomiting, enlarged glands, rashes, **swollen eye** (most common), and diarrhea. More advanced stage symptoms include heart failure, issues eating, weakness, and abnormal heart rhythms.  \n\nWhile the disease is still a major issue in Latin American countries (and in the US in a smaller number), with the medicines"

Let me explain.\n\nI was a child during the 1960's. At that time I was exposed to what I later considered to be the last vestiges, in the form of humor, of a particular cultural meme. This meme probably originated in the 1920's or the 1930's as a reaction to the proliferation of \"modern art\" following the first world war. Dada, surrealism, cubism, etc. This meme as I was exposed to it consisted of variations of the sentence: \"I don't know much about art, but I know what I like.\"\n\nLater when I attended college I was exposed to people speaking about works of art such as those classified as abstract expressionism saying things like, \"I don't consider that to be Art.\" and \"My four year old child could have done that.\"\n\nAs I thought about this I came to the conclusion that people were using the word \"art\" not as a classification of human activity but as a word indicating a value judgement. In other words, \"I don't consider a work to be 'Art' unless I consider it to be good"

But art works are humanly designed aesthetic experiences. *Poiesis*.\n\nYou say that music is *sound*. In some sense, this is true\u2014music, as we conventionally think of it, manifests acoustically. Sound is the \"material\" cause of music.\n\nBut music is also, like any art, about patterns, configurations, ways of framing and arranging human experience. In this sense, this is music's \"formal\" cause: the way in which we arrange psychoacoustic experience.\n\nIn the case of music, these patterns manifest primarily through \"sound\", and in \"time.\"\n\nWhen we think of a painting, we see a fixed, static image. This is formative.\n\nWhen we think of a song, we think of changing patterns. This is *trans*formative.\n\nSo, music is about human-framed acoustic patterns experienced horizontally in time. *Changes (and repetitions)*.\n\n(Music to the greeks"

They allow formalizing the syntax of domain-specific or general-purpose programming languages concisely and declaratively. However, the natural and concise way of writing a context-free grammar is often ambiguous. Therefore, grammar formalisms support extensions in the form of *declarative disambiguation rules* to specify operator precedence and associativity, solving ambiguities that are caused by the subset of the grammar that corresponds to expressions. **Inquiry** Implementing support for declarative disambiguation within a parser typically comes with one or more of the following limitations in practice: a lack of parsing performance, or a lack of modularity (i.e., disallowing the composition of grammar fragments of potentially different languages). The latter subject is generally addressed by scannerless generalized parsers. We aim to equip scannerless generalized parsers with novel disambiguation methods that are inherently performant, without compromising the concerns of modularity and language composition. **Approach** In this paper, we present a novel low-overhead implementation technique"

Specifically, we study one-parameter families $(M^4,\\omega,F_t=(J,H_t))_{0 \\leq t \\leq 1}$ of systems with a fixed Hamiltonian $S^1$-space $(M,\\omega,J)$ and which are semitoric for certain values of the parameter $t$, with a focus on such families in which one singular point undergoes a Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcation (also called nodal trade in the context of semitoric systems, and more generally almost toric fibrations). Beyond semitoric systems, we also study families containing hypersemitoric systems, and we investigate the local theory of a nodal trade. Building on and generalizing the ideas of a previous paper, we show how such families can be used to find explicit semitoric systems with certain desired invariants (bundled in the marked semitoric polygon). This allows us to make progress on the semitoric minimal model program by understanding and coming up with explicit systems for each strictly minimal type (i.e. those not admitting any toric or semitoric type blowdown). In order to obtain these systems, we develop strategies for constructing and understanding explicit"

Most introverts don't hate socialising, they just get tired of it faster than extroverts and need more time to recharge afterwards. It doesn't have anything to do with our ability to socialise, how \"hyper\" we are or how bad or good we are at making friends etc. That is shyness, and in more serious cases social anxiety (those are also two very different things).

To understand its benefit and challenge the proposed methodology in a real scenario, we chose to compare the outcome when applying it to the analysis of two patient populations with a significant but highly different types of fatigue: COVID19 and multiple sclerosis (MS). Experimental: 31P-MRS was performed on a 3T clinical MRI, in 19 COVID19 patients, 38 MS patients, and 40 matched healthy controls. Dynamic acquisitions using an MR-compatible ergometer ran over a rest(40s), exercise(2min), and a recovery phase(6min). Long and short TR acquisitions were also made at rest for T1 correction. The advanced data quality control pipeline presented in part 1 is applied to the selected patient cohorts to investigate its impact on clinical outcomes. We first used power and sample size analysis to estimate objectively the impact of adding QCS. Then, comparisons between patients and healthy control groups using validated QCS were performed using unpaired T-tests or Mann-Whitney tests (p<0.05).Results: The application of the QCS resulted in increased"

Because if Catalonia receive independence from Spain, they will apply to become a member of the EU in order to still receive the benefits. In order to become a member, all existing states need to accept Catalonia unanimously. Its hard to imagine Spain accepting them into the EU.\n\nEven if they manage to get into the EU, this could trigger a similar situation in many other regions in Europe. Belgium is a prime example, a Belgian friend told me that the Walloon region wants to separate and have its own independent state.\n\nThis could trigger similar situations in many countries, then eventually many laws and trade agreements would have to be revised, and the European economy could potentially descend into chaos.\n\nI'll be honest once again, I do not know that much about the situation yet, its just an outside view of how things could pan out for me.

However, I see there is a general consensus that barbell exercises are much better for the lower body. Having known that, I was thinking if there was a way in which I can incorporate sandbags into my leg workout. I've taken a look at the Bulgarian sandbag, but the fact that most of them weigh up to 50 pounds with no way to add weight on makes it seem less viable in my opinion. Also, for deadlifts, I've looked at some VERY cheap sand at [Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.ca/product/king-construction-sand-30kg/902210) which seems amazing, but ~67 LBS still seems pretty low for a beginner trying to progress as fast as possible during the \"noob gainz\" phase. It may be great for starting, but where do I go from there to progress? Do you guys have any creative ideas to maybe load two of the sand bags in one? What type of bag can hold 100+ LBS of sand? Are there any other substitutes for barbells for deadlifts and squats that are cheap?\n\n**TL;DR: Any way to increase weight for sandbags for deadlifts and squats"

However, this can be curtailed somewhat by what we define to be our in-group. This can be modified by our ideology, our culture, and any other normative socializing that might happen. The alleged \"cure\" for racism, then, is to work with our tribal psycho-biology and seek to define our in-group to be more inclusive, especially along racial lines.\n\nIf my understanding of this is correct, then I think that this could be self-defeating in terms of a solution.

Or just keep on using the base exercies?\n[deleted]: Well, there's an issue here.\n\nBW progressions often have relatively large jumps in between them, so workin up to 10x10, then attempting to do 10x10 of the next progression, isn't going to work.\n\nIf you have access to weights, I suppose you could do 10x10 with weighted movements (wieghted chins, weighted dips, ect) as this would make it much easier to control the resistance. \ndudehellacool: I guess I could use a backpack and a few water bottles until I get real weights. Is is really more effective at hypertrophy than normal progressions and reps/sets? And if you were to make a routing around GVT, what exercises would you add?\n[deleted]: I've never done it, but everyone I've ever known who has done it all said some variation"

Right now it is half tile half bare cement floor, block walls, and a thin pressboard ceiling (though it should be mentioned that part of the ceiling is bare beams as our power mains and a water pipe are there). It has to be low cost because my parents are not millionaires and my mom already has several home improvement projects started that take up the budget. So my idea was to fasten 2x4's into the wall about 20\" apart all around the room, as studs. Run any electrical I need for spare outlets or what have you through and around the \"studs\". Then I would make the walls out of reclaimed pallet wood. Where I live, free pallets are a dime a dozen, so the walls should be mostly the cost of the two-bys. For the ceiling I would tear out the pressboard and old lights we have now, run any electrical I need again, and install a new ceiling using some inexpensive material and install some new lighting fixtures. That also seems like it shouldn't be too bad as long as I remember to leave the mains and the valve for that pipe"

        "text": "We have shown, in a series of articles, that a classical description of a large number of economic agents can be replaced by a statistical fields formalism. To better understand the accumulation and allocation of capital among different sectors, the present paper applies this statistical fields description to a large number of heterogeneous agents divided into two groups. The first group is composed of a large number of firms in different sectors that collectively own the entire physical capital. The second group, investors, holds the entire financial capital and allocates it between firms across sectors according to investment preferences, expected returns, and stock prices variations on financial markets. In return, firms pay dividends to their investors. Financial capital is thus a function of dividends and stock valuations, whereas physical capital is a function of the total capital allocated by the financial sector. Whereas our previous work focused on the background fields that describe potential long-term equilibria, here we compute the transition functions of individual agents and study their probabilistic dynamics in the background field, as a function of their initial state"

But standing around for 3-5 minutes after every set feels like a massively suboptimal use of time. In the past I've been more hypertrophy focused where the rest times are shorter, and I'd also superset all the exercises, so I basically end up with \\~30-45 seconds rest between exercises in a superset, which I'd typically fill with in-place jogging or step-ups or something to keep my heart-rate up, which I found lead to a significant increase in stamina through the workout. I actually started off doing supersets with strength-focused workouts, but I found this to be too taxing. Maybe this is a matter of conditioning? I'm not sure. Currently I'm trying to fill the time with either stretching or light cardio.\n\nSo my question to you all, is, in your strength focused workouts / exercises, what do you do with your 3-5 minutes? Do you superset with something else? Cardio"

Right or wrong, the lower courts have put a lot of thought into their decisions. They've explained their reasoning in public opinions that balance the rights of research companies like Monsanto against farmers like the Mr. Bowman. So far, the courts have found that the public benefit of incentivizing genetic research by protecting gene patents outweighs the public benefit of providing cheaper seeds to farmers.\n\nThe statistics about increasing seed prices are misleading. It is true that seed prices are increasing. The increase is due to patented technology and also to rapid consolidation among seed providers. There are/were even some antitrust violation investigations into the seed industry. It's not good, and many farmers would like to see more competition amongst seed providers.

In some languages, the types are unreliable; in others, communication across type boundaries can be extremely expensive; and still others allow only limited forms of interoperability.

Inquiry: This paper describes Static Python, a language developed by engineers at Instagram that has proven itself sound, fast, and reasonably expressive in production. Static Python's approach to gradual types is essentially a programmer-tunable combination of the concrete and transient approaches from the literature. Concrete types provide full soundness and low performance overhead, but impose nonlocal constraints. Transient types are sound in a shallow sense and easier to use; they help to bridge the gap between untyped code and typed concrete code.

Originally I started the project to up my programming game (and because I bought the domain years ago...), but then I found the topic fascinating. You can also suggest items if they are not in the database and I'll research and add them. :)\n\nSince"

To get the same pressure from water as a typical countertop sealer does from atmospheric pressure, you'd have to submerge your bag to about 20 feet, or more than twice the depth of a typical in-ground backyard pool. (32.8 feet would be needed to achieve a full atmosphere difference - but then again, a countertop vacuum sealer would have to draw a perfect vacuum in order to get a 1 atmo gradient).\n\nSo because of the minuscule amount of pressure supplied, the water method will still leave plenty of air in the bag - it'll just be trapped as smaller bubbles around and within the food.

Although ubiquitous, developing IoT systems remains challenging. Inquiry: A recent field study with 194 IoT developers identifies debugging as one of the main challenges faced when developing IoT systems. This comes from the lack of debugging tools taking into account the unique properties of IoT systems such as non-deterministic data, and hardware restricted devices. On the one hand, offline debuggers allow developers to analyse post-failure recorded program information, but impose too much overhead on the devices while generating such information. Furthermore, the analysis process is also time-consuming and might miss contextual information relevant to find the root cause of bugs. On the other hand, online debuggers do allow debugging a program upon a failure while providing contextual information (e.g., stack trace).

He was one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement, whose members were often called \"Tractarians\"; they aimed to reform the Church of England by reasserting its links with the early Catholic church.  The college was incorporated by royal charter dated 6 June 1870. Under its terms, the governance of the college was in the hands of the Warden (the head of the college) and a council of nine to twelve members; the Warden could veto almost any decision of the council and so was in a strong position. Other Oxford colleges, in contrast, were run by the head of the college and the Fellows. By keeping matters relating to religion and the college's internal affairs in the hands of the council, rather than college academics (termed Tutors at Keble during this period), the founders hoped to maintain Keble's religious position as \"a bastion of 'orthodox' Anglican teaching\" against the opponents of Tractarianism.

The drops are in an atmosphere of nitrogen saturated with water where they grow by condensation and eventually touch each other and coalesce. A new convex composite drop is rapidly formed that then exponentially and slowly relaxes to an equilibrium hemispherical cap. The characteristic relaxation time is proportional to the drop radius R * at final equilibrium. This relaxation time appears to be nearly 10 7 times larger than the bulk capillary relaxation time t b = R * $\\eta$/$\\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is the gas--liquid surface tension and $\\eta$ is the liquid shear viscosity. In order to explain this extremely large relaxation time, we consider a model that involves an Arrhenius kinetic factor resulting from a liquid--vapour phase change in the vicinity of the contact line. The model results in a large relaxation time of order t b exp(L/RT) where L is the molar latent heat of vaporization, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature.

They argue that the supposed 'witch cult' revolved around worshiping a Horned God of fertility and the underworld, whose Christian persecutors identified with the Devil, and whose followers held nocturnal rites at the witches' Sabbath.\nThe theory was pioneered by two German scholars, Karl Ernst Jarcke and Franz Josef Mone, in the early nineteenth century, and was adopted by French historian Jules Michelet, American feminist Matilda Joslyn Gage, and American folklorist Charles Leland later that century. The hypothesis received its most prominent exposition when it was adopted by a British Egyptologist, Margaret Murray, who presented her version of it in The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (1921), before further expounding it in books such as The God of the Witches (1931) and her contribution to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

They point out the jokes made about Lewinsky, but Bill Clinton is hardly mentioned without a joke about this affair. I would wager that if you did a free association experiment and said \"Bill Clinton\", a huge proportion would respond with something about this case. And he was President; he's done a lot of high-profile things in his life, but this trumps them all.\n\nI want to clarify that I do feel bad for Lewinsky. She didn't ask for this notoriety (though fooling around with a married man who is also the POTUS surely wasn't seen as without risk). Unfortunately, it's literally the only thing most people know about her and this profoundly effects her life still. But I don't think that's necessarily misogyny or slut-shaming.\nLeeser: It is, though. A man can get a blowjob and have a career. A woman can do the same and have to move to another country to find work, as Lewinsky had to do. \nAxelFriggenFoley: Well, again, it's not exactly apples to apples. Both were taken"

Despite that, I was still floored by how little I had to do, and exactly how cheap it was.  At $6, this is one of the cheapest fitness tools that can be made.

Initially, sporadic efforts were made to establish a customs post at this location in 1830 and then again in 1831, but these efforts were less than successful.

Banning alcohol flat-out would only cause problems and probably more than I know of, but my opinion is that the 'culture' we have built around alcohol in western society (I'm Western European, if anyone's interested) is very toxic to our every day life and especially children growing up. \n\nMy background preceding this view is, I think, important. So I'll start of with that. I grew up in a small village where alcohol and straight alcoholism is not treated as much of a big deal. In fact, people fail to recognize alcholism and problem-drinkers so extremely much that my own mother has grown up into extreme alcoholism without ever getting the help she has been needing for over at least 40 years. It has affected both herself and those close to her, including me. She has recently confessed to me that her problem had been going on for this long and that the people around her in her youth (my guess would be early 20's) thought her attitude towards alcohol was cool. \n\nThis is not rare.

There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been observed before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as SN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still unclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the existence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with superwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN progenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on the nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments, in particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain metallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn, SNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives.

Insulin, released by the pancreas, is the hormone the body uses to take sugar out of the blood (where it is transported) and into cells that need it.

The word \"diabetes\" comes from Greek, and it literally means excessive discharge of urine. This is one of the symptoms of diabetes. The excess urination (polyuria) is due to high sugar levels in the blood. High sugar is actually toxic to the individual, so the body - specifically kidneys- attempts to rid the elevated glucose levels, and its end product is urination. Other symptoms are excessive hunger (polyphagia) and excessive thirst (polydipsia"

People who score low on a IQ test typically give up on school and life because they believe that they can't do it. People who score low (lower than 90) also have the tendency to suffer self esteem issues and depression.

I just want to mention to people that IQ shouldn't determine your outcome. \n\nI mean IQ doesn't really measure everything that has to do with intelligence. The triarchic theory of intelligence is a more holistic approach than IQ. So it's still possible to have a slightly lower IQ (80-90) range and still be able to do well in school and life.

I've been  doing the RR, starting with the primer, for about 5 months and have had a lot of success in improving my strength and some body recomp.

While my progress with push ups has been great I plateaued with pull-ups at the beginning of August and haven't made much progress since. I've tried all of the tips I see on this subreddit, I tried Hampton's advice from youtube, I tried greasing the groove. I've watched 100 videos and read 100 posts and blogs about this.  I've been doing rows and negatives, and band assisted pull ups and I'm not getting any progress.   \n\n\nI thought that I was being impatient but after 2 months my best workouts peak at 3x6. I suspect that losing some weight might help but I'm not very overweight (6'1\" 200 lbs) and my weight isn't stopping my progress in any other exercise. Just this one.  \n\n\nAny advice aside from just doing the same stuff? Thanks.\nOnlyHereToWatch11: Also - are you getting 8 hours sleep every night and eating enough"

It states that the pre-independence agreements are invalid and are angled heavily in the favour of the Madras Presidency, and has demanded a renegotiated settlement based on \"equitable sharing of the waters\". Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, says that it has already developed almost 3,000,000 acres (12,000 km2) of land and as a result has come to depend very heavily on the existing pattern of usage.

However, after the accession of James II he was restored to favour and served as Lord Privy Seal from 1687 to 1688. His great-great-great-grandson, the eighth Baron (the title having descended from father to son), was an avid collector of art and accumulated immense debts in building and furnishing New Wardour Castle.\nHe had no sons and was succeeded by his cousin, the ninth Baron.

The heating and cooling is also to change the softness/hardness properties of the cooled metal. They way you cool it determines if the molecules form a more lattice like or chaotic configuration. The more lattice like, the more it behaves like a crystal (eg. Diamond super hard but super brittle). The more chaotic the molecules, the softer the metal becomes and as well as more pliable (eg. Lead). The reason we put it in the oven was to hit that sweet spot of hard and flexible so I could use it like a crowbar but still have a sharp knife.

I recently experienced not having anybody to talk to as it was really late at night (3-4 am), but really felt the need to do so as I was going through a crisis for a recent breakup, so I instead called the suicide hotline as I knew you can call them in case of non-emergency situations too.

It is shown that for any (non-homogeneous) purely diffusing system, under any isotropic uniform incidence, the average length of trajectories through the system (the average length of the random walk trajecto-ries from entry point to first exit point) is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion process and therefore depends only on the geometry of the system. This exact invariance property may be seen as a generalization to diffusion of the well known mean-chord-length property [1], leading to broad physics and biology applications. Let us first consider a practical animal-biology example that was at the origin of the theoretical work reported hereafter. It is well established, for diverse species, that the spontaneous displacement of insects such as ants, on an horizontal planar surface, may be accurately mod-eled as a constant-speed diffusion random-walk [2-4]. We assume that a circle of radius R is drawn on the surface and we measure the average time that ants spend inside the circle when they enter it (see Fig. 1). The last assumption is"

Spectral lines from atoms and molecules in primordial perturbations at high redshifts can give information about the conditions in the early universe before and during the formation of the first stars in addition to the epoch of reionisation. The lines may arise from moving primordial perturbations before the formation of the first stars (resonant scattering lines), or could be thermal absorption or emission lines at lower redshifts. The difficulties in these searches are that the source redshift and evolutionary state, as well as molecular species and transition are unknown, which implies that an observed line can fall within a wide range of frequencies. The lines are also expected to be very weak. Observations from space have the advantages of stability and the lack of atmospheric features which is important in such observations.

        "text": "Despite recent experimental progress towards observing large zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs) as signatures of Majorana modes, confusion remains about whether Majorana modes have been observed. This is in part due to the theoretical prediction of fine-tuned trivial (i.e., non-topological) zero-bias peaks that occur because of uncontrolled quantum dots or disorder potentials. While many aspects of the topological phase can be somewhat fine-tuned because the topological phase space is often small, the quantized height of the ZBCP associated with a Majorana mode is known to be robust at sufficiently low temperatures even as the tunnel barrier is pinched off to vanishingly small normal-state conductance. The key shortcoming of the existing experimental works is an acute lack of stability of the putative Majorana mode features, indicating the probable absence of a topological phase, and the current paper suggests specific experimentally accessible measures for a careful quantitative analysis of the measured ZBCP stability. In this paper, we study how the counter-intuitive robustness of the ZBCP height to the tunnel barrier strength can be used to distinguish Majorana modes from non-topological"

The challenge we address is making the complexity of DSAL implementation comparable to that of DSLs and the effectiveness of programming with DSALs comparable to that of general-purpose aspect languages (GPALs). Today, despite being essentially both domain-specific and aspect-oriented, DSALs seem to be second-class. Aspect development tools (e.g., AJDT) do not work on DSAL code. DSL development tools like language workbenches (e.g., Spoofax) neither deal with the backend weaving nor handle the composition of DSALs.

The logic differs from previous work in probability logics in that it uses a probability distribution over the domain of discourse, whereas most previous work (e.g., Nilsson [2], Scott et al.

The logic Lp possesses some further important features. First, Lp is a superset of first order logic, hence it can represent ordinary logical assertions.

These systems exploit the actor model's isolation property to fulfill their performance and scalability demands. Unfortunately, the reliance of the model on isolation as its most fundamental property requires programmers to express complex interaction patterns between their actors to be expressed manually in terms of complex combinations of messages sent between the isolated actors. Inquiry: In the last three decades, several language design proposals have been introduced to reduce the complexity that emerges from describing said interaction and coordination of actors. We argue that none of these proposals is satisfactory in order to express the many complex interaction patterns between actors found in modern reactive distributed systems. Approach: We describe seven smart home automation scenarios (in which an actor represents every smart home appliance) to motivate the support by actor languages for five radically different types of message synchronization patterns, which are lacking in modern distributed actor-based languages.

On the other hand, other experiments have failed to see such a signal. In this thesis, we present two analyses.

We find that the 3+1 model provides a better fit to the global data set compared to the null, with an improvement of $\\Delta \\chi^2 = 51$ with the addition of only 3 degrees of freedom, corresponding to $6.6\\sigma$. While a substantial improvement, we also find a irreconcilable tension between the data sets of $5.1\\sigma$, calculated using the parameter goodness-of-fit test.

The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium rests upon three pillars: exothermic ion-neutral reactions (\" cold chemistry \"), endothermic neutral-neutral reactions with significant activation barriers (\" warm chemistry \"), and reactions on the surfaces of dust grains.

The aim of this study is to observationally confirm the association of atomic oxygen with both atomic and molecular gas phases, and to understand the measured abundances of OH and OH + as a function of the available reservoir of H2. Methods. We obtained absorption spectra of the ground states of OH, OH+ and OI with high-velocity resolution, with GREAT on-board SOFIA, and with the THz receiver at the APEX.

Before analysis, the cells are usually permeabilised and treated with a fluorescent dye that stains DNA quantitatively, such as propidium iodide (PI) or 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The fluorescence intensity of the stained cells correlates with the amount of DNA they contain. As the DNA content doubles during the S phase, the DNA content (and thereby intensity of fluorescence) of cells in the G0 phase and G1 phase (before S), in the S phase, and in the G2 phase and M phase (after S) identifies the cell cycle phase position in the major phases (G0/G1 versus S versus G2/M phase) of the cell cycle. The cellular DNA content of individual cells is often plotted as their frequency histogram to provide information about relative frequency (percentage) of cells in the major phases of the cell cycle.\nCell cycle anomalies revealed on the DNA content frequency histogram are often observed after different types of cell damage, for example such DNA damage that interrupts the cell cycle progression at certain checkpoints.

Using the mathematical theory of measurement and the physical theory of dimensional analysis, this book provides a coherent theory of value based on an equivalence relation not at the level of exchange, but of production. Indeed exchange is considered here as an equivalence relation between money and a monetary price, and not between commodities, modern monetary theory having demonstrated that money is not a commodity.

As accurate modelling of the sources of variability is a cornerstone to intelligent decision making, we investigate the consequences of the assumption of independent and identically distributed variables that is often made when modelling sources of variability such as down-times, arrivals, or process-times. We first explain the experiment setting that allows, through simulations and statistical tests, to measure the variability potential stored in a specific sequence of data. We show from industrial data that dependent behaviors might actually be the rule with potentially considerable consequences in terms of cycle time.

This suggests determinism - the idea that every event or state of affairs, including every human decision and action, is the inevitable and necessary consequence of previous states of affairs. If determinism is true, we have no free will because we could not have acted in any other way - our actions are completely determined by previous events.\n\nAnd consciousness remains unexplained because it is not possible to reduce conscious experience to physical descriptions. (at least at present this is not possible - although eliminativists claim it will be in the future)  No matter how detailed our physical explanation, the further question remains - why is this physical function/mechanism/process accompanied by inner states of conscious experience?\n\n\nMaceWumpus: Let's be clear: someone"

They learn how to execute the chain but they also learn how to disrupt it. If an opponent throws a 2 quick jabs you can expect the next punch will be a cross with their rear hand or a hook with their lead hand, and that lead hook is going to be fairly wide and they'll be trying to step off of your centerline to get an angle on you. Knowing that, when those 2 quick jabs come in you can reasonably predict you need to get your head out of the way.

In some religions it is the love of the Supreme Being, whether it be God or others, transported through us to those around us. However if you try and think about it in a deeper, more logical sense, what is it really? Where did it come from? Is it really a supernatural thing that us mortal beings somehow experience in our organic lifetime? Or is it something much simpler?\n\nTo think about this, one must put aside all bias. Put aside all religious, spiritual, or traditional beliefs and look at the concept of love as a natural thing. How can we know that it is natural rather than supernatural? Simply because it happens in nature. We, as human beings, are a part of nature, and since we experience what we call love, love is logically a part of nature.\n\nNow, where did love come from? When did humans first come up with the idea of love? Humans identify with love, along with most deep emotions like hatred and jealousy, independently from the rest of the animal kingdom.

A first question thus arose as to the integration of indoor lighting conditions into the simulation, leading to a new model calculating natural and artificial lighting. The results of this new daylighting module were then compared with results of other simulation codes and experimental cases both in artificial and natural environments. Excellent agreements were obtained, such as the values for luminous efficiencies in a tropical and humid climate. In this paper, a comparison of the model output with detailed measures is presented using a dedicated test cell in Reunion Island (French overseas territory in the Indian Ocean), thus confirming the interest for thermal and daylighting designs in low-energy buildings.

He was the first Muslim sovereign to rule from Delhi, and is thus considered the effective founder of the Delhi Sultanate.\nSold into slavery as a young boy, Iltutmish spent his early life in Bukhara and Ghazni under multiple masters. In the late 1190s, the Ghurid slave-commander Qutb ud-Din Aibak purchased him in Delhi, thus making him the slave of a slave. Iltutmish rose to prominence in Aibak's service, and was granted the important iqta' of Badaun. His military actions against the Khokhar rebels in 1205\u20131206 gained attention of the Ghurid ruler Muhammad of Ghor, who manumitted him even before his master Aibak was manumitted.\nAfter Muhammad of Ghor's assassination in 1206, Aibak became a practically independent ruler of the Ghurid territories in India, with his headquarters at Lahore. After Aibak's death, Iltutmish dethroned his unpopular successor Aram Shah in 1211, and set up his capital at Delhi. He then consolidated his rule by subjugating several dissidents, and fighting against other former Ghurid slaves"

Although language workbenches have simplified the design of DSLs and extensions to general purpose languages, static analyses must still be implemented manually. Inquiry: Moreover, static analyses, e.g., complexity metrics, dependency analysis, and declaration-use analysis, are usually domain-dependent and cannot be easily reused. Therefore, transferring existing static analyses to another DSL incurs a huge implementation overhead. However, this overhead is not always intrinsically necessary: in many cases, while the concepts of the DSL on which a static analysis is performed are domain-specific, the underlying algorithm employed in the analysis is actually domain-independent and thus can be reused in principle, depending on how it is specified. While current approaches either implement static analyses internally or with an external Visitor, the implementation is tied to the language's grammar and cannot be reused easily.

Haven\u2019t had time to make the video yet and I wanted to go ahead and get it out in written form so I will go over the general plan here which you can apply to your own training and I will also cover how I use it myself. I originally made this routine using information I learned through reading Overcoming Gravity, and polished it by consulting with the book\u2019s author, Steven Low.\n\nThis is focused on progression for intermediate gymnastics strength trainees who are on the larger side (&gt;180lbs, &gt;6\u2019). Those are not hard limits, but the further you are below them, I\u2019d only say this would be helpful if you were closer to the advanced/elite skills.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nI will first preface by saying that I am not a licensed personal trainer, nor am I a medical professional, so by using my program or any program for that matter you are doing so at your own risk. This program is for an intermediate to advanced trainee, and you should have"

Since the publication of \"Design Patterns\" by Gamma et al. in 1994, there have been hundreds of books published about design / software patterns, thousands of published pattern languages, and tens of thousands of published patterns. \"Notes,\" published in 1964, was quickly followed by one of Alexander's most important essays, \"A City is Not a Tree,\" in which he repudiates the formal method described in \"Notes,\" and his Preface to the paperback edition of \"Notes\" in 1971 repeats the repudiation.

(In the royal arms as used in Scotland, the Scottish coat appears in the first and fourth quarters and the English one second.).  An example of party per saltire is the arms of the medieval Kingdom of Sicily which also consists of four sections, with top and bottom displaying the coat of the Crown of Aragon, and left and right the coat of the Sicily branch of the Hohenstaufen dynasty during their reign as Holy Roman Emperors.\nHowever, in most traditions there is no limit on the number of divisions allowed, and the records"

A first goal was to develop mass spectrometry approaches to detect non-covalent interactions between antitumor drugs and their DNA target. Twenty years ago, our attention turned towards specific DNA structures such as the G-quadruplex (a structure formed by guanine-rich strands). Mass spectrometry allows to discern which molecules interact with one another by measuring the masses of the complexes, and quantity the affinities by measuring their abundance. The most important findings came from unexpected masses. For example, we showed the formation of higher- or lower-order structures by G-quadruplexes used in traditional biophysical assays. We can also derive complete thermodynamic and kinetic description of G-quadruplex folding pathways by measuring cation binding, one at a time.

Inquiry: Although database management systems provide tools to control access to data, these tools are not well-suited for modern applications which often have many users and consist of many different software components. First, databases are unaware of application users, and creating a new database user for each application user is impractical for applications with many users. Second, different components of the same application may require different authority, which would require creating different database users for different software components. Thus, it is difficult to use existing tools to properly limit the authority an application has when executing queries.
