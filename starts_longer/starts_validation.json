However, this can be curtailed somewhat by what we define to be our in-group. This can be modified by our ideology, our culture, and any other normative socializing that might happen.

CMV\nThe reason that I believe this is because there have been many cases where the victim of rape conceives a child and the convicted rapist has parental rights over it after they have served time in jail. If the victim decides that they want to give the child up for adoption, they must first receive written permission from the rapist. This means that they must go to their own rapist, request for the child to be put up to adoption, and have them sign a form. I cannot even imagine the psychological turmoil that this would have on the victim. There have been cases where the victim wants to give the child to adoption, but the rapists will only agree to consent if the victim does not testify against the rapist. I believe that there is a total of 31 states who currently allow rapists to request and hold parental rights over their rape-conceived children. For example, in this article, a woman was raped and conceived a child. When the child was 6 years old, the rapist wanted parental rights over it. http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/01/us/rapist-child-custody/ \n\nEdit: Due"

The probabilistic inference scheme reduces to the ordinary logical inference when the probabilities of all propositions are either 0 or 1. This logic has the same limitations of other probabilistic reasoning systems of the Bayesian approach. For common sense reasoning, consistency is not a very natural assumption. We have some well known examples: {Dick is a Quaker, Quakers are pacifists, Republicans are not pacifists, Dick is a Republican}and {Tweety is a bird, birds can fly, Tweety is a penguin}. In this paper, we shall propose some extensions of the probabilistic logic. In the second section, we shall consider the space of all interpretations, consistent or not.

I\u2019ve made a couple friends through clubs but not that many. I do talk to girls in my clubs but it never goes anywhere.\n\nI\u2019m just wondering, what can i do to start going on dates?

        "text": "In essence, a neural network is an arbitrary differentiable, parametrized function. Choosing a neural network architecture for any task is as complex as searching the space of those functions. For the last few years, 'neural architecture design' has been largely synonymous with 'neural architecture search' (NAS), i.e. brute-force, large-scale search. NAS has yielded significant gains on practical tasks. However, NAS methods end up searching for a local optimum in architecture space in a small neighborhood around architectures that often go back decades, based on CNN or LSTM. In this work, we present a different and complementary approach to architecture design, which we term 'zero-shot architecture design' (ZSAD). We develop methods that can predict, without any training, whether an architecture will achieve a relatively high test or training error on a task after training. We then go on to explain the error in terms of the architecture definition itself and develop tools for modifying the architecture based on this explanation. This confers an unprecedented level of control on the deep learning practitioner. They can make informed design decisions before the first line of code is written"

Nearly 40% of strokes result in a loss of vision, and up to 1% of the adult population suffers from vision loss due a stroke. This condition is known as [Hemianopia](https://journals.lww.com/jneuro-ophthalmology/fulltext/2006/09000/homonymous_hemianopia_in_stroke.5.aspx) and it cuts your vision in both eyes, on one side of the visual field. However, many people are not aware that strokes can affect your vision, and if your only symptom is vision loss many hospitals will not administer TPA, a drug critical to reversing stroke effects.\n\nThe common expression for recognizing a stroke is FAST - Face, Arm, Speech, Time - which represents three common symptoms and that treating a stroke quickly is critical. However many in the stroke field (myself included) prefer BE FAST, which adds Balance and Eyes to the list of symptoms.\n\nSo, TL;DR - Strokes can affect vision, and you should be aware of the possible signs and symptoms to protect yourself and loved ones.

Research endeavours involving WBAN are directed towards effective transmission of detected parameters to a Local Processing Unit (LPU, usually a mobile device) and analysis of the parameters at the LPU or a back-end cloud. An important concern in WBAN is the lightweight nature of WBAN nodes and the need to conserve their energy. This is especially true for subcutaneously implanted nodes that cannot be recharged or regularly replaced. Work in energy conservation is mostly aimed at optimising the routing of signals to minimise energy expended. In this paper, a simple yet innovative approach to energy conservation and detection of alarming health status is proposed. Energy conservation is ensured through a two-tier approach wherein the first tier eliminates `uninteresting' health parameter readings at the site of a sensing node and prevents these from being transmitted across the WBAN to the LPU.

Next time you're way too eager for a hot cookie and obliterate your mouth with its delicious, piping hot gooeyness, be sure to cure it with sugar. \n\nThis trick works every time for me-- I'm fairly certain it has something to do with the enzyme amylase, which digests sugars in your mouth.

Be extremely generous with the sugar. \n\n-Keep your mouth open/ tongue out, because this ensures that the sugar stays put and doesn't get swallowed. \n\nAfter about a minute, or longer if you wish, you're pretty much good to go.

The choreography can then be automatically projected (compiled) to a correct implementation for each participant. This paradigm is interesting because it relieves the programmer from manually writing the separate send and receive actions performed by participants, which simplifies development and avoids communication mismatches. However, the applicability of choreographic programming in the real world remains largely unexplored. The reason is twofold. First, while there have been several proposals of choreographic programming languages, none of these languages have been used to implement a realistic, widely-used protocol. Thus there is a lack of experience on how realistic choreographic programs are structured and on the relevance of the different features explored in theoretical models. Second, applications of choreographic programming shown so far are intrusive, in the sense that each participant must use exactly the code projected from the choreography. This prevents using the code generated from choreographies with existing third-party implementations"

When bouldering, especially outdoors on real rock, the first move from a sit start is often a rather explosive movement upward. Even moving a short distance takes a lot of power. Because sit starts tend to be on overhanging boulders (for the non-climbers here that just means that the rock is beyond vertical), you can't take much weight on the feet. To make the move, you need to pull upward explosively while tensing up your core explosively in order to stay against the rock while you move upwards. Even when I stick these moves, I tend to be pretty gassed out from the exertion and unable to finish the boulder problem. It's extra hard for me b/c I am semi-tall (6'1\"), which means that on sit starts I am very scrunched up and have lots of legs and body in the way or hanging off the rock as I explode upward.\n\nFew gym problems are designed to train this kind of move, but they're super common outdoors.

Previous observations of SiO, H13CO+, HN13C and H13CN toward the young L1448-mm outflow showed an over-excitation of the ion fluid that was attributed to an electron density enhancement in the precursor. We re-visit this interpretation and test if it still holds when we consider different source morphologies and kinetic temperatures for the observed molecules, and also give some insight on the spatial extent of the electron density enhancement around L1448-mm. We estimate the opacities of H13CO+ and HN13C by observing the J=3\\to2 lines of rarer isotopologues to confirm that the emission is optically thin. To model the excitation of the molecules, we use the large velocity gradient (LVG) approximation with updated collisional coefficients to i) re- analyse the observations toward the positions where the over-excitation of H13CO+ has previously been observed [i.e. toward L1448- mm at offsets (0,0) and (0,-10)], and ii) to investigate if the electron density enhancement is still required for the cases of extended and compact emission, and for kinetic temperatures of up to 400 K.

When bouldering, especially outdoors on real rock, the first move from a sit start is often a rather explosive movement upward. Even moving a short distance takes a lot of power. Because sit starts tend to be on overhanging boulders (for the non-climbers here that just means that the rock is beyond vertical), you can't take much weight on the feet. To make the move, you need to pull upward explosively while tensing up your core explosively in order to stay against the rock while you move upwards. Even when I stick these moves, I tend to be pretty gassed out from the exertion and unable to finish the boulder problem. It's extra hard for me b/c I am semi-tall (6'1\"), which means that on sit starts I am very scrunched up and have lots of legs and body in the way or hanging off the rock as I explode upward.\n\nFew gym problems are designed to train this kind of move, but they're super common outdoors.

Put aside all religious, spiritual, or traditional beliefs and look at the concept of love as a natural thing. How can we know that it is natural rather than supernatural? Simply because it happens in nature. We, as human beings, are a part of nature, and since we experience what we call love, love is logically a part of nature.\n\nNow, where did love come from?

Such a simple solution that solves many problems and is environmentally friendly as well.  Think about how many rolls of paper towel are used in every US bathroom every year...  Long story short - carry a handkerchief to dry your hands instead of using paper towels.  Other benefits include:  wiping your brow while performing stressful tasks, use as a pocket square in a pinch (if it looks nice and isn't too dirty), or blowing your nose when absolutely necessary"

Specifically, we consider a setting in which k identical (probabilistic) agents, initially placed at some central location, collectively search for a treasure in the two-dimensional plane. The treasure is placed at a target location by an adversary and the goal is to find it as fast as possible as a function of both k and D, where D is the distance between the central location and the target. This is biologically motivated by cooperative, central place foraging such as performed by ants around their nest. In this type of search there is a strong preference to locate nearby food sources before those that are further away. Our focus is on trying to find what can be achieved if communication is limited or altogether absent. Indeed, to avoid overlaps agents must be highly dispersed making communication difficult. Furthermore, if agents do not commence the search in synchrony then even initial communication is problematic. This holds, in particular, with respect to the question of whether the agents can communicate and conclude their total number, k. It turns"

First, the \"transparent conceivability\" argument: because we can conceive of a consciousness-less world where physicalism is true, physicalism does not entail consciousness. Second, the knowledge argument: a person with all the data about an experience still \"learns\" something when they actually experience it. These two arguments are supposed to be compelling reasons to reject physicalism. Are they?\n\nThe first argument equates conceivable with possible, but the fact that zombies are conceivable does not mean that they are possible. Even at my most charitable, I do not understand why \"we can imagine a conscious-less world of physicalism\" is any sort of adequate refutation. The fact that we lack the knowledge to find a contradiction between physicalism and the zombie thesis does not mean there isn't one; we should be more reluctant to discard physicalism. To a physicalist, a zombie is nonsensical. It would be like postulating if the concept of \"health\" evaporates if we compare"

To get the same pressure from water as a typical countertop sealer does from atmospheric pressure, you'd have to submerge your bag to about 20 feet, or more than twice the depth of a typical in-ground backyard pool. (32.8 feet would be needed to achieve a full atmosphere difference - but then again, a countertop vacuum sealer would have to draw a perfect vacuum in order to get a 1 atmo gradient).\n\nSo because of the minuscule amount of pressure supplied, the water method will still leave plenty of air in the bag - it'll just be trapped as smaller bubbles around and within the food.

They did not come with much, and most were unskilled.  But they were willing to work and dug themselves out of poverty.

Nowadays, however, when illegals come to the US, even though they essentially are doing the exact same things as our ancestors... we see them as undesirable, while the former we see admirably.\n\nWhy is this?  Well, due to the welfare state we endow citizens with a certain pro-rated piece of the government expenditure that comes out of tax dollars.

Anyone who knows much about sexual assault would question the idea that a rapist always has to be physically stronger than his victim. If that's what you're trying to imply, why not just come right out and say so? Similarly, the reporter suggests that the events Diallo describes couldn't have occurred in six to seven minutes - but never goes quite as far as to make that claim. He can't, because it's not true. Six to seven minutes is actually a reasonable time frame for a fairly brutal sexual assault, and one that would feel nightmarishly sustained during the event. \n\nThe result is that we're left with a vague sense of a conspiracy that doesn't really fit together, but since the never comes right out"

Photos below\nTL;DR  \nI don't know how to reinstall a toilet that was installed correctly, using ONLY a Pasco quick ring on top of a broken cast iron flange and wax ring, by a pro (a friend) the first time last year, BUT leaked when it was reinstalled recently by family after various attempts to unclog the drain (one using acid). Since my family said they installed it hastily AND, the flanges sat beneath the height of the finish floor by 1/4\"-3/16\" I thought those two factors contributed to the leaking (if not the acid). Don't have access to that friend currently. But, even tho my friend did it right, I figured adding a spacer could ensure no leaking. But, as a totally ignorant and inexperienced person I didnt feel comfortable proceeding--thinking I could be wrong, then new can of worms...

        "text": "Boiling crisis is the rapid formation of the quasi-continuous vapor film between the heater and the liquid when the heat supply exceeds a critical value. We propose a mechanism for the boiling crisis that is based on the spreading of the dry spot under a vapor bubble. The spreading is initiated by the vapor recoil force, a force coming from the liquid evaporation into the bubble. Since the evaporation intensity increases sharply near the triple contact line, the influence of the vapor recoil can be described as a change of the apparent contact angle. Therefore, for the most usual case of complete wetting of the heating surface by the liquid, the boiling crisis can be understood as a drying transition from complete to partial wetting. The state of nucleate boiling, which is boiling in its usual sense, is characterized by a very large rate of heat transfer from the heating surface to the bulk because the superheated liquid is carried away from the heating surface by the departing vapor bubbles. If the heating power is increased, the temperature of the heating surface increases with the heat flux. When the heat flux from the heater reaches a threshold value q CHF (the critical heat flux"

The method of deriving photometric metallicities using red giant branch stars is applied to resolved stellar populations under the common assumption that they mainly consist of single-age old stellar populations.

We use photometric data sets for the five Galactic dwarf spheroidals Sculptor, Sextans, Carina, Fornax, and Leo II in order to derive their photometric metallicity distribution functions from their resolved red giant branches using isochrones of the Dartmouth Stellar Evolutionary Database. We compare the photometric metallicities with published spectroscopic metallicities based on the analysis of the near-infrared Ca triplet (Ca T), both on the metallicity scale of Carretta & Gratton and on the scale defined by the Dartmouth isochrones. In addition, we compare the photometric metallicities with published spectroscopic metallicities based on spectral synthesis and medium-resolution spectroscopy, and on high resolution spectra where available.

This can also cause your heart to beat harder, causing anxiety.\nWhy YSK: if you are already prone to depression or anxiety, dehydration makes it feel much worse, and it's so easy to do by accident. Because you don't have enough volume of blood, its harder for your body to maintain blood flow. This causes your body to mimic the symptoms of depression (fatigue, brain fog, dizziness), which can cause you to think the depressed thoughts, causing your brain to make depression chemicals. When that makes you feel shitty enough, your heart will try to fix it by beating harder, raising your blood pressure, mimicking anxiety. Additionally, it becomes harder for your blood to carry oxygen, making you breathe harder, which for me is the one that causes me to panic.\n\nThis isn't a WoW tHaNkS iM cUrEd, but for me personally makes a huge difference.

The algorithm samples a candidate solution from a standard multivariate normal distribution scaled by a step-size and centered in the current solution. This solution is accepted if it has a better objective function value than the current one. Crucial to the algorithm is the adaptation of the step-size that is done in order to maintain a certain probability of success. The algorithm, already proposed in the 60's, is a generalization of the well-known Rechenberg's $(1+1)$ Evolution Strategy (ES) with one-fifth success rule which was also proposed by Devroye under the name compound random search or by Schumer and Steiglitz under the name step-size adaptive random search. In addition to be derivative-free, the algorithm is function-value-free: it exploits the objective function only through comparisons. It belongs to the class of comparison-based step-size adaptive randomized search (CB-SARS). For the convergence analysis, we follow the methodology developed in a companion paper for investigating linear convergence"

They looked effective, like rings, but easier to hang and effortless to store. Then I saw the price. $199? $150? What the fuck, it's just a hollow tube and paracord. Madness!\n\nHaving made my own DIY PVC rings before, I immediately knew that this would be a very cheap and simple project. Despite that, I was still floored by how little I had to do, and exactly how cheap it was.  At $6, this is one of the cheapest fitness tools that can be made. At less than $3, there's literally no excuse for not having a pair as a substitute/alternative to traditional rings.\n\n[Instructions on imgur](http://imgur.com/a/wcHmw)\n\nYou'll need:\n\n* Two 12\" x 3/4\" or 1/2\" PVC\n* One 20' length of 550# paracord\n* One small quick link\n\nWith tax, that cost me $6.17\n\nFor work, you'll need to cut the PVC to the appropriate length, and tie two [Figure 8 knots](http://www.netknots.com/rope_knots/figure-eight).

Although it is NP-hard to find an optimal solution for an arbitrary number of sequences, due to the importance of this problem researchers are trying to push the limits of exact algorithms further. Since MSA can be cast as a classical path finding problem, it is attracting a growing number of AI researchers interested in heuristic search algorithms as a challenge with actual practical relevance. In this paper, we first review two previous, complementary lines of research. Based on Hirschbergs algorithm, Dynamic Programming needs O(kN^(k-1)) space to store both the search frontier and the nodes needed to reconstruct the solution path, for k sequences of length N. Best first search, on the other hand, has the advantage of bounding the search space that has to be explored using a heuristic. However, it is necessary to maintain all explored nodes up to the final solution in order to prevent the search from re-expanding them at higher cost. Earlier approaches to reduce the Closed list are either incompatible with pruning methods for the Open list, or must retain at least the boundary of the Closed list. In"

Today I tried splitting them up into sets of 8-10 from the get go to not wear my grip out too much at the start, but the same issue still occurred where after about 9 and a half minutes my forearms were so pumped I couldn't even hold on to the bar with one arm. It always happens very suddenly as well, up to 95 my arms feel completely fine and then when I try and hang after my last set my hand literally feels as though it's about to rip off the bar. I tend to randomly alternate between chin-ups and pull-ups because chin-ups are harder on the grip but easier to perform reps, but pull-ups are much harder to engage my scapula"

Quantitative models for conversion of kerogen into oil and gas and the timing of hydrocarbon generation have been well documented. However, lack of consensus about the kinetics of hydrocarbon formation in source rocks, expulsion timing and how the resulting hydrocarbons escape from or are retained in the source rocks motivates further investigation. In particular, many mechanisms for the transport of hydrocarbons from the source rocks in which they are generated into adjacent rocks with higher permeabilities and smaller capillary entry pressures have been proposed, and a better understanding of this complex process (primary migration) is needed. To characterize these processes it is imperative to use the latest technological advances.

It's not uncommon for a patient to go into cardiac arrest, fall unconscious from lack of oxygen, be given CPR, and become conscious again--only to lose consciousness once more when the CPR stops.\n\nThe whole point is to keep the brain alive until someone arrives with a defibrillator.  *That* is designed to get the heart beating normally again.\n\nSo if you ever find yourself desperately trying to give someone CPR because you saw it done on TV, don't do any of that crap like"

They are the first progression (including their slightly scaled down cousin, the Wall Plank as shown in the video) of the handstand that actually involves being in a handstand, and of all the progressions for the handstand this one is the most important for helping you transfer that 'bodyline straightness' into an upside down, 'there's so much blood in my head and I can't breathe' style position.\n\nBecause of that, it's important to note that the Chest to Wall handstand is not just a progression that you can 'master' and them dump on the side of the road like an old shoe.

They feel like the other person doesn\u2019t actually want to talk to them, and yes, it\u2019s true, they probably don\u2019t wanna talk to you. But there\u2019s a reason why and here\u2019s how you can prevent it:\n\nGive off good vibes. If you\u2019re all serious and sad and trying to let everyone know you\u2019re depressed, nobody will want to associate with you. They might be nice to you, but that\u2019s only because they feel bad. They look at you as some little sad creature that needs a hug, not a friend. Even if you feel like you\u2019re dying inside, you need to act happy and smile. acting depressed around other people is NOT attractive if you want to find a significant other or just a friend. Crack jokes, smile, laugh, tease, use light sarcasm, accept any flaws you have and don\u2019t be defensive are just some things you can do. Everyone wants to be happy, so being around someone who always looks serious and insecure"

We make this notion precise by introducing regularly varying time series. We provide general large deviation results for functionals acting on a sample path and vanishing in some neighborhood of the origin. We study a variety of such functionals, including large deviations of random walks, their suprema, the ruin functional, and further derive weak limit theory for maxima, point processes, cluster functionals and the tail empirical process. One of the main results of this paper concerns bounds for the ruin probability in various heavy-tailed models including GARCH, stochastic volatility models and solutions to stochastic recurrence equations. 1. Preliminaries and basic motivation In the last decades, a lot of efforts has been put into the understanding of limit theory for dependent sequences, including Markov chains (Meyn and Tweedie [42]), weakly dependent sequences (Dedecker et al. [21]), long-range dependent sequences (Doukhan et al. [23], Samorodnitsky [54]), empirical processes (Dehling et al. [22]) and more general structures (Eberlein and Taqqu"

One such type of application is *prosumer* applications, which are distributed applications that both produce and consume many events. We analyse the problems that occur when using a reactive programming language or framework to implement prosumer applications. We find that the assumption of an open network, which means prosumers of various types spontaneously join and leave the network, can cause a lot of code complexity or run-time inefficiency. At the basis of these issues lies *acquaintance management*: the ability to discover prosumers as they join and leave the network, and correctly maintaining this state throughout the reactive program. Most existing reactive programming languages and frameworks have limited support for managing acquaintances, resulting in accidental complexity of the code or inefficient computations. In this paper we present acquaintance management for reactive programs. First, we design an *acquaintance discovery* mechanism to create a *flock* that automatically discovers prosumers on the network. An important"

This system bends when it is subject to an electric field orthogonal to the film and can thus be used as an actuator. Conversely, the deflection of the film generates a potential difference between the electrodes ; the same system can therefore be used as a sensor.We have developed a ''continuous medium'' model for this system.

These theories primarily address the needs of expert systems, using knowledge structures which must be pre-compiled and remain static in structure during runtime. Many Al systems require the ability to dynamically add and remove parts of the current knowledge structure (e.g., in order to examine what the world would be like for different causal theories). This requires more flexibility than existing uncertainty systems display. In addition, many Al researchers are only interested in using \"probabilities\" as a means of obtaining an ordering, rather than attempting to derive an accurate probabilistic account of a situation. This indicates the need for systems which stress ease of use and don't require extensive probability information when one cannot (or doesn't wish to) provide such information. This paper attempts to help reconcile the gap between approaches to uncertainty and the needs of many AI systems by examining the control issues which arise, independent of a particular uncertainty calculus. when one tries to satisfy these needs.

Interestingly, the planet's parent star is an active, rapidly rotating solar-like star with a large fraction (7 to 20%) of spots. Aims: We want to provide constraints on the properties of the star-planet system and understand whether the planet's inferred large size may be due to a systematic error on the inferred parameters, and if not, how it may be explained. Methods: We combine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available spectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the system parameters. Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling (including spots and stellar activity) that would yield the required ~10% reduction in size for the star and thus the planet. Two classes of solutions are found: the usual main sequence solution for the star yields for the planet a mass of 3.67+/-0.13 Mjup, a radius of 1.55+/-0.03 Rjup for an age that is at least 130Ma, and should be less than 500Ma given the star's fast rotation and significant activity.

One of the key points in the development of the constitutive laws of these materials, either at the local or at the global scale, is to formulate a free energy density (or enthalpy) from vectors, tensors, at a given order and for a class of given symmetry, depending on the symmetry classes of the crystal constituting the material or the symmetry of the representative volume element. This article takes as a support of study the stress and magnetization couple ($\\sigma$, m) involved in the phenomena of magnetoelastic coupling in a cubic symmetry medium. Several studies indeed show a non-monotonic sensitivity of the magnetic susceptibility and magnetostriction of certain soft magnetic materials under stress. Modeling such a phenomenon requires the introduction of a second order stress term in the Gibbs free energy density. A polynomial formulation in the two variables stress and magnetization is preferred over a tensorial formulation. For a given material symmetry class, this allows to express more easily the free energy density at any bi-degree in $\\sigma$ and m (i.e. at any constitutive tensors"

There's an important point to understand about engines: they are optimized for a fixed rotation speed. Optimally around 2000 - 3000 rpm.\nWhen the engine is accelerating, the speed is changing, and its fuel usage is not optimized. So, try to keep the engine speed as constant as possible, and this means driving in a *cool* mood.\n\n    EDIT: The optimal RPM is dependent on the car model, and can be as low as 1500, and it's a range, not a specific number. Test with your car and see where you get the most acceleration.\n\n2. 2nd point is braking is what wastes your energy. Look 2 cars ahead of you when you're driving. If you know you'll need to brake soon, do not push the gas pedal. Keep an able safety distance.\n\n3. Opening the windows and having extra attachments to the car increases air drag and wastes energy.

However people treat this as a question that can be asked and has an answer, rather than a statement that is unfinished. One thing we must take into consideration is the definition of life. When dose it start, when dose it end, if there is a spirtual afterlife there would be no end to life. If alien lifeforce existed, they may come from a galaxy governed on different physical laws, which may make our 'life' seem so insignificant that it can not be considered as life. \n\nAnother view is that if you look on the universe holisticly and take in the idea of the interconenectedness of all things, then how can life be defined without claiming that all, or non, of the things involved in our life are so important to our exsitance, that they are the meaning themselfs. \n\nI would also like to state another idea. Starting with the idea that the universe is considered to be infinite. However it is also considered to be illogical for anything that exists (physically) to be infinite. The universe is also a vaccum, so therefore it is nothingness. Which supports the idea that it can be infinite as it is not physical"

CMV\nThe reason that I believe this is because there have been many cases where the victim of rape conceives a child and the convicted rapist has parental rights over it after they have served time in jail. If the victim decides that they want to give the child up for adoption, they must first receive written permission from the rapist. This means that they must go to their own rapist, request for the child to be put up to adoption, and have them sign a form. I cannot even imagine the psychological turmoil that this would have on the victim. There have been cases where the victim wants to give the child to adoption, but the rapists will only agree to consent if the victim does not testify against the rapist. I believe that there is a total of 31 states who currently allow rapists to request and hold parental rights over their rape-conceived children. For example, in this article, a woman was raped and conceived a child. When the child was 6 years old, the rapist wanted parental rights over it. http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/01/us/rapist-child-custody/ \n\nEdit: Due"

We selected four regions with a very high occurrence of coreshine cases: Taurus-Perseus, Cepheus, Chameleon and L183/L134.

        "text": "Context: Meta programming consists for a large part of matching, analyzing, and transforming syntax trees. Many meta programming systems process abstract syntax trees, but this requires intimate knowledge of the structure of the data type describing the abstract syntax. As a result, meta programming is error-prone, and meta programs are not resilient to evolution of the structure of such ASTs, requiring invasive, fault-prone change to these programs. Inquiry: Concrete syntax patterns alleviate this problem by allowing the meta programmer to match and create syntax trees using the actual syntax of the object language. Systems supporting concrete syntax patterns, however, require a concrete grammar of the object language in their own formalism. Creating such grammars is a costly and error-prone process, especially for realistic languages such as Java and C++. Approach: In this paper we present Concretely, a technique to extend meta programming systems with pluggable concrete syntax patterns, based on external, black box parsers. We illustrate Concretely in the context of Rascal, an open-source meta programming system and language workbench, and show how to reuse existing parsers for Java"

Optimally around 2000 - 3000 rpm.\nWhen the engine is accelerating, the speed is changing, and its fuel usage is not optimized. So, try to keep the engine speed as constant as possible, and this means driving in a *cool* mood.\n\n    EDIT: The optimal RPM is dependent on the car model, and can be as low as 1500, and it's a range, not a specific number. Test with your car and see where you get the most acceleration.\n\n2. 2nd point is braking is what wastes your energy. Look 2 cars ahead of you when you're driving. If you know you'll need to brake soon, do not push the gas pedal. Keep an able safety distance.\n\n3. Opening the windows and having extra attachments to the car increases air drag and wastes energy. If not required, keep the windows shut, especially on the high way. Using the air conditioner on the highway is more efficient"

The targeting of the burqa implies a increased suspicion of a religious group, something that a secular government isn't supposed to do. \n\nThe drafter of the bill said: \"Those who want to integrate are welcome irrespective of their religion. But those who rebuff our values and aim to build a parallel society based on religious laws, and want to place it over our society, are not welcome.\"\nThat is ridiculous.

To provide some useful information on how the injury happened:\n\nFirst exercise in the workout I did was pull ups for 5 sets. The sets looked like 8-8-7-7-6 and 8 is the most reps I can do in a set so I was pushing myself pretty hard. This is the first time I tried arch body technique which I think is why the injury happened. Before I had been doing only hollow body pull ups which is more beginner friendly. Hollow body pull ups use more of your lats. Arch body puts more work on your upper back than the lats, which are way bigger so they can take more stress. Anyways, the injury actually occured in my next exercise which was chin ups. It's not because I did pull ups and followed that with chin ups, I have done that many times before with no problems and I used only hollow body technique. So the take away is beginners should only use hollow body and avoid arch body before reaching 10-12 reps of pull ups. And before building proper proprioception and mind-muscle connection.\n\nI need to give it time to recover but I also don't want to stop working. I have"

Second, and much like in a purely artistic discipline, the act of programming is driven partly by the notion of aesthetics: the pleasure we have in creating beautiful things. Even though the importance of aesthetics in the act of programming is now unquestioned, more could still be written on the subject. The field called \"psychology of programming\" focuses on the cognitive aspects of the activity, with the goal of improving the productivity of programmers. While many scientists have emphasized their concern for aesthetics and the impact it has on their activity, few computer scientists have actually written about their thought process while programming.

This metastructural level offers a flexible framework through which information is continuously and operatively being symbolized. Today, Information technology and the availability of abundant urban data streams could be considered as forerunners of our time, having unprecedented impacts comparable to the ones brought by the steam engine at the dawn of industrialisation and the electrification of cities.

People who score low on a IQ test typically give up on school and life because they believe that they can't do it.

AGB can be mapped using synthetic aperture radar data (SAR) or passive optical data. However, these data are insensitive to high AGB levels (\\textgreater{}150 Mg/ha, and \\textgreater{}300 Mg/ha for P-band), which are commonly found in tropical forests. Studies have mapped the rough variations in AGB by combining optical and environmental data at regional and global scales. Nevertheless, these maps cannot represent local variations in AGB in tropical forests. In this paper, we hypothesize that the problem of misrepresenting local variations in AGB and AGB estimation with good precision occurs because of both methodological limits (signal saturation or dilution bias) and a lack of adequate calibration data in this range of AGB values. We test this hypothesis by developing a calibrated regression model to predict variations in high AGB values (mean \\textgreater{}300 Mg/ha) in French Guiana by a methodological approach for spatial extrapolation with data from the optical geoscience laser altimeter system (GLAS), forest inventories, radar, optics, and environmental"

Prognostic markers are useful to stratify the patients into groups, guiding towards precise medicine discovery. The widely used prognostic markers in cancers include stage, size, grade, node and metastasis. In addition to these common markers, there are prognostic markers specific to different cancer types. For example estrogen level, progesterone and HER2 are markers specific to breast cancer patients. There is evidence showing that genes behaving as tumor suppressors or carcinogens could act as prognostic markers due to altered gene expression or mutation. Besides genetic biomarkers, there are also biomarkers that are detected in plasma or body fluid which can be metabolic or protein biomarkers.\nTraditional prognostic markers in oncology include tumor size, staging, lymph node spreading status, and metastasis. Large tumor, late staging, presence of cancer cells in multiple distant lymph nodes, and observation of metastasis often associate with poor prognosis.\nIn recent years, advances in molecular techniques, genomics, cancer biology and sequencing technology have provided opportunities"

The heating and cooling is also to change the softness/hardness properties of the cooled metal. They way you cool it determines if the molecules form a more lattice like or chaotic configuration. The more lattice like, the more it behaves like a crystal (eg. Diamond super hard but super brittle). The more chaotic the molecules, the softer the metal becomes and as well as more pliable (eg.

And that it's just cruel to make an animal live it's life without ever knowing the joy of having babies. Because we all know that having and raising children is the most calming, zen thing around without a single complication that could end the mothers life. This is just crazy talk people. Yes, some dogs love being moms but not every animal needs to do it and there is no \"magic\" that turns them into better pets because \"they had their own babies to love\". \n\nSpaying early on while pets are still young can not only prevent a lot of problems including uterine cancer but neutering males young can prevent any prostate problems or even testicular cancer. And in lots of areas there is low cost help, including fixing cats as low as $20 each"

The population size of these mountain bird tends to decline on the reference sites and shows differences according to changes in local landscape characteristics. Habitat changes are at the centre of the identified pressures impacting part or all of its life cycle, according to experts. Hence, an approach to monitor population dynamics, is trough modelling the favourable habitats of Black Grouse breeding (nesting sites). Then, coupling modelling with multi-source remote sensing data (medium and very high spatial resolution), allowed the implementation of a spatial distribution model of the species. Indeed, the extraction of variables from remote sensing helped to describe the area studied at appropriate spatial and temporal scales: horizontal and vertical structure (heterogeneity), functioning (vegetation indices), phenology (seasonal or inter-annual dynamics) and biodiversity. An annual time series of radiometric indices (NDVI, NDWI, BI {\\ldots}) from Sentinel-2 has made it possible to generate Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) to derive phenological indications on the nature and dynamics"

A wealth of techniques for managing and curating data (and its provenance) have been proposed, largely in the database community. In particular, a number of influential papers have proposed collecting provenance information explaining where a piece of data was copied from, or what other records were used to derive it. Most of these techniques, however, exist only as research prototypes and are not available in mainstream database systems. This means scientists must either implement such techniques themselves or (all too often) go without. This is essentially a code reuse problem: provenance techniques currently cannot be implemented reusably, only as ad hoc, usually unmaintained extensions to standard databases. An alternative, relatively unexplored approach is to support such techniques at a higher abstraction level, using metaprogramming or reflection techniques.

Nearly 40% of strokes result in a loss of vision, and up to 1% of the adult population suffers from vision loss due a stroke. This condition is known as [Hemianopia](https://journals.lww.com/jneuro-ophthalmology/fulltext/2006/09000/homonymous_hemianopia_in_stroke.5.aspx) and it cuts your vision in both eyes, on one side of the visual field. However, many people are not aware that strokes can affect your vision, and if your only symptom is vision loss many hospitals will not administer TPA, a drug critical to reversing stroke effects.\n\nThe common expression for recognizing a stroke is FAST - Face, Arm, Speech, Time - which represents three common symptoms and that treating a stroke quickly is critical. However many in the stroke field (myself included) prefer BE FAST, which adds Balance and Eyes to the list of symptoms.\n\nSo, TL;DR - Strokes can affect vision, and you should be aware of the possible signs and symptoms to protect yourself and loved ones.

Having known that, I was thinking if there was a way in which I can incorporate sandbags into my leg workout.

Also, for deadlifts, I've looked at some VERY cheap sand at [Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.ca/product/king-construction-sand-30kg/902210) which seems amazing, but ~67 LBS still seems pretty low for a beginner trying to progress as fast as possible during the \"noob gainz\" phase.

The nonlinear evolution of these instabilities generates a state of turbulence with significantly different spatio-temporal features compared to Newtonian turbulence, termed elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT). We explore EIT by studying the dynamics of a submerged planar jet of a dilute aqueous polymer solution injected into a quiescent tank of water using a combination of schlieren imaging and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). We show how fluid elasticity has a nonmonotonic effect on the jet stability depending on its magnitude, creating two distinct regimes in which elastic effects can either destabilize or stabilize the jet. In agreement with linear stability analyses of viscoelastic jets, an inertio-elastic shear-layer instability emerges near the edge of the jet for small levels of elasticity, independent of bulk undulations in the fluid column. The growth of this disturbance mode destabilizes the flow, resulting in a turbulence transition at lower Reynolds numbers and closer to the nozzle compared to the conditions required for the transition"

We first study general birth and death processes and we give non-explosion and extinction criteria, moment computations and a pathwise representation. We then show how different scales may lead to different qualitative approximations, either ODEs or SDEs. The prototypes of these equations are the logistic (deterministic) equation and the logistic Feller diffusion process. The convergence in law of the sequence of processes is proved by tightness-uniqueness argument. In these large population approximations, the competition between individuals leads to nonlinear drift terms. We then focus on models without interaction but including exceptional events due either to demographic stochasticity or to environmental stochasticity. In the first case, an individual may have a large number of offspring and we introduce the class of continuous state branching processes. In the second case, catastrophes may occur and kill a random fraction of the population and the process enjoys a quenched branching property.

Ideally, the formal verification of a compiler should include the formal verification of each component of the tool-chain. An example is the CompCert project, a formally verified C compiler, that comes with associated tools and proofs that allow to formally verify most of those components. However, some components, in particular the lexer, remain unverified. In fact, the lexer of Compcert is generated using OCamllex, a lex-like OCaml lexer generator that produces lexers from a set of regular expressions with associated semantic actions. Even though there exist various approaches, like CakeML or Verbatim++, to write verified lexers, they all have only limited practical applicability. In order to contribute to the end-to-end verification of compilers, we implemented a generator of verified lexers whose usage is similar to OCamllex. Our software, called Coqlex, reads a lexer specification and generates a lexer equipped with a Coq proof of its correctness. It provides a formally verified implementation of most features of standard, unverified lexer generators. The conclusions of our work are two-fold"

The stream, which is a sequence of elements available in a data source, and the stream pipeline, which contains operations (e.g., map, filter, reduce) that are applied to the elements in the stream upon execution. Streams are getting popular among Java developers as they leverage the conciseness of functional programming and ease the parallelization of data processing. Despite the benefits of streams, in comparison to data processing relying on imperative code, streams can introduce significant overheads which are mainly caused by extra object allocations and reclamations, and the use of virtual method calls. As a result, developers need means to study the runtime behavior of streams in the goal of both mitigating such abstraction overheads and optimizing stream processing.

Unit tests and functional tests do not suffice because of race conditions that are not discovered by those tests. This problem is addressed by model checking tools. A simple model checker is useful for detecting race conditions prior to production. Inquiry: Current model checkers hardwire the behavior of common thread operations, and do not recognize application-dependent thread paradigms or functions using simpler primitive operations. This introduces additional operations, causing current model checkers to be excessively slow. In addition, there is no mechanism to model the semantics of the actual thread wakeup policies implemented in the underlying thread library or operating system. Eliminating these constraints can make model checkers faster. Approach: McMini is an **extensible** model checker based on DPOR (Dynamic Partial Order Reduction). A mechanism was invented to declare to McMini new, primitive thread operations, typically in 100~lines or less of C~code.

Barrie's 1904 play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up with music and lyrics by Leonard Bernstein; it opened on Broadway on April 24, 1950.  This version starred Jean Arthur as Peter Pan, Boris Karloff in the dual roles of George Darling and Captain Hook, and Marcia Henderson as Wendy. The show was orchestrated by Trude Rittmann and Hershy Kay and conducted by Benjamin Steinberg. The show ran for 321 performances, closing on January 27, 1951.\nThe production was initially intended as a full-blown musical, with Bernstein composing a complete score for it, but was staged with only five songs \u2013 \"Who Am I?\", \"Pirate's Song\", \"Plank Round\", \"Build My House\", and \"Peter Peter\" \u2013 to accommodate the limited vocal ranges of the principals.\nIn 1998, conductor Alexander Frey began research into whether there may have existed more material that Bernstein had composed for Peter Pan. Over the next seven years, as his schedule allowed, he discovered and restored almost an hour of previously unheard music, much of the material found (and not yet orchestrated) in the archives of the composer's manuscripts.

It has been reported clinically that rupture or dissections in thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) often occur due to hypertension which may be modelled with sudden increase of peripheral resistance, inducing acute changes of blood volumes in the aorta. There is clinical evidence that more compliant aneurysms are less prone to rupture as they can sustain such changes of volume. The aim of the current paper is to verify this paradigm by evaluating computationally the role played by the variation of peripheral resistance and the impact of aortic stiffness onto peak wall stress in ascending TAA. Methods. Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) analyses were performed using patient-specific geometries and boundary conditions derived from 4D MRI datasets acquired on a patient. Blood was assumed incompressible and was treated as a non-Newtonian fluid using the Carreau model while the wall mechanical properties were obtained from the bulge inflation tests carried out in vitro after surgical repair.

But standing around for 3-5 minutes after every set feels like a massively suboptimal use of time. In the past I've been more hypertrophy focused where the rest times are shorter, and I'd also superset all the exercises, so I basically end up with \\~30-45 seconds rest between exercises in a superset, which I'd typically fill with in-place jogging or step-ups or something to keep my heart-rate up, which I found lead to a significant increase in stamina through the workout. I actually started off doing supersets with strength-focused workouts, but I found this to be too taxing. Maybe this is a matter of conditioning? I'm not sure. Currently I'm trying to fill the time with either stretching or light cardio.\n\nSo my question to you all, is, in your strength focused workouts / exercises, what do you do with your 3-5 minutes?

It takes more commitment then the conventional way of reducing acne.\n\n 1) Only use water when cleansing your face. This means no make up, acne ointment, soap, ect. Though these products can partially help your skin, they do more damage than good with over-dryness which cause more issues and can even encourage more acne. My wife spends more time on her eye makup since she doesn't apply other facial makeup. \n\n2) Before going to bed, [facial steam](http://www.wikihow.com/Do-a-Steam-Facial). If you want to even go more effective, put coconut oil on your face right before you steam-up! Some believe that coconut oil has the properties to actually **pull**/absorb bacteria and other toxins.\n\nWe've both been doing this, including the coconut oil, and I have especially noticed that her face is both clearning up--even within a week! Her face especially looks much more healthy while it's not so dry! Try it, it won't disappoint! \n\nedit: I accept no liability if someone tries this on their ass. \nHungarianHoney: Be careful, coconut oil is comedogenic"

I'm a total DIY beginner but I have been reading up and watching videos on the tiling BUT I just want to run through my plan and ask questions beforehand to make sure nothing goes wrong. Just for reference, house is from 1999 so fairly new. \n\nCurrently there is vinyl in the kitchen (which looks like is over plywood - http://imgur.com/AGbdy4t ):\n\n1. Score vinyl with utility cutter. \n2. Peel up. \n3. Remove plywood (EDIT: someone said there's probably plywood there and needs to be removed) \n\nNow for actual flooring: \n\n1. Use modified thinset between subfloor and Ditra. Spread and stick it on. \n2. Use non-modified thinset above between Ditra and tile. (But must use latex additive for porcelain tile? Does it apply to ceramic as well?) \n\nSome general questions: \n\n1. How long does it take to dry between all the layers? I've heard it takes awhile - up to a week?\n2. How do I tile around/cut the tile to work for this vent? (By the window - http://imgur.com/3o1Zk0W) I have read some stuff about using"

        "text": "Context: Reactive programming (RP) is a declarative programming paradigm suitable for expressing the handling of events. It enables programmers to create applications that react automatically to changes over time. Whenever a time-varying signal changes -- e.g. in response to values produced by event stream (e.g., sensor data, user input...) -- the program state is updated automatically in tandem with that change. This makes RP well-suited for building interactive applications and reactive (soft real-time) systems. Inquiry: RP Language implementations are often built on top of an existing (host) language as an Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL). This results in application code in which reactive code and non-reactive code is inherently entangled. Using a mechanism known as lifting, one usually has access to the full feature set of the (non-reactive) host language in the RP program. However, lifting is also dangerous. First, host code expressed in a Turing-complete language may diverge, resulting in unresponsive programs: i.e. reactive programs that are not actually reactive. Second, the bi-directional integration of reactive and non-reactive code results in a paradigmatic mismatch"
