I think people have been proven wrong far too often about the \"inevitableness\" of our problems to think that they are ever right. So what could the solutions be? If any are ever presented, they usually involve shifting power around in some way. Power, being the ability to affect change, seems the logical thing to modify. The spectrum seems to range between anarchism and statism, and the various hybrids of the two. \n\nLibertarians think that people need more freedom (ie, the state should have less power), and usually adopt a \"let the weak fend for themselves\" attitude, which they think will lead to a better civilization.

I need to \"get up in there\" to do some network wiring and there are a couple of problems. Minor problem is that the basement was rented out so noise was an issue so there's actual insulation between the tiles and the 1st floor joists. That makes lifting the tiles a bit problematic, both in terms of pure vertical space available and angling the tiles to get, say, my arm up there.  \n\nBiggest problem, for me, however, is the \"tightness\" of the tiles. Meaning they fit quite snugly into their grid squares. So much so that getting a lifted tile to nestle all the way back down is difficult.  In other houses, I've been able to just \"tap\" the tiles quickly upwards and their subsequent downward momentum caused them to fall into place.

Unusual PEO cathodic micro-discharges have been observed and investigated. It is shown that the cathodic micro-discharges exhibit a collective intermittent behavior which is discussed in terms of charge accumulations at the layer/electrolyte and layer/metal interfaces. Optical emission spectroscopy is used to determine the electron density (typ. 10 15 cm-3) and the electron temperature (typ. 7500 K) while the role of F-anions on the appearance of cathodic micro-discharges is pointed out. Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) is a promising plasma-assisted surface treatment of light metallic alloys (e.g. Al, Mg, Ti). Although the PEO process makes it possible to grow oxide coatings with interesting corrosion and wear resistant properties, the physical mechanisms of coating growth are not yet completely understood.

Serendipitous X-ray surveys have proven to be an efficient way to find rare objects, for example tidal disruption events, changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGN), binary quasars, ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), and intermediate mass black holes. With the advent of very large X-ray surveys, an automated classification of X-ray sources becomes increasingly valuable.Aims. This work proposes a revisited naive Bayes classification of the X-ray sources in the Swift-XRT and XMM-Newton catalogs into four classes -- AGN, stars, X-ray binaries (XRBs) and cataclysmic variables (CVs) -- based on their spatial, spectral and timing properties and their multiwavelength counterparts. An outlier measure is used to identify objects of other natures. The classifier is optimized to maximize the classification performance of a chosen class (here XRBs) and it is adapted to data mining purposes.Methods. We augmented the X-ray catalogs with multiwavelength data, source class, and variability properties. We then built a reference sample of about 25000 X-ray sources of known nature.

Not the individual.\n\nHere's what I'm going at: We often talk about the future of the Human Race, and how we'll need to leave earth and travel to other planets if we want humans to keep existing. The thing is, I see no reason as to why we must try to ensure the survival of the human race, as of today. We can't work together as a species, and something as simple and stupid as the place where we're born is enough to separate us so immensely that we act as if a Brazilian Human is essentially different from a Japanese Human. We are still too stubborn to recognize the characteristics of our species (such as stubbornness) that we could use to improve ourselves and work better together.\n\nWe still have huge amounts of people denying science and fighting over what religion is right, even in aspects we know them to be wrong. We don't trust each other. And as someone who believes in some form of capitalism, I think we're reaching the worst that it has, to the point where it seems we really are artificially splitting ourselves more and more.\n\nTake nuclear weapons, for example (and"

Marey believed that the visual should replace language in many fields. Indeed, the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries saw an exponential multiplication of visual media, particularly with the advent of digital technology. However, this ''graphics revolution'' has not affected all disciplines equally. Significant differences remain between scientific fields such as astrophysics, anthropology, chemistry and medieval history, despite their shared commitment to describing dynamic processes and changes of state. Yet, while historians have already digitized a large part of the cultural heritage from Antiquity to the 10th-13th centuries, exploration of this corpus using visualizations remains limited. There is therefore untapped potential in this field.This article begins by outlining a typology and quantification of the past and potential roles of visual representations in medieval history.

        "text": "The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Due to the plasma screening effect, the color attraction between the heavy quark antiquark pair inside a quarkonium is significantly suppressed at high temperature and thus no bound states can exist, i.e., they \"melt\". In addition, a bound heavy quark antiquark pair can dissociate if enough energy is transferred to it in a dynamical process inside the plasma. So one would expect the production of quarkonium to be considerably suppressed in heavy ion collisions. However, experimental measurements have shown that a large amount of quarkonia survive the evolution inside the high temperature plasma. It is realized that the in-medium recombination of unbound heavy quark pairs into quarkonium is as crucial as the melting and dissociation. Thus, phenomenological studies have to account for static screening, dissociation and recombination in a consistent way. But recombination is less understood theoretically than the melting and dissociation. Many studies using semi-classical transport equations model the recombination effect from the consideration of detailed balance"

The biggest problem I see with DIY hardwood floor finishing, is that people read an article online that says rent a drum sander and buy some poly from Home Depot. There's more to it than that, and if you follow those simplistic instructions, you're gonna end up with a refinished floor, but it's not going to be very nice, and it probably won't last long.\n\nAlso, note that I don't talk about installation in this, only refinishing.  Installation is a whole other article.  If there's interest, I'll post something on that.\n\n=====\nFirst off, do NOT use a drum sander. These things will leave the floor uneven and you'll be able to see it in the reflected light off the floor. A lot of the rentals have been abused and are out of adjustment and can leave gouges or lines in the floor also.

Currently my workouts revolve around the USMC PFT, so focus on the 3 mile run, pull ups, and plank. I can do a ~21 minute 3 mile, max the pull ups with 23, and max the plank at 4:20.\n\nI want to get better at all of these things, but I've never been able to balance running and lifting.\n\nWhat can I do so that I can crush the strength standards (far past the 'max') while also getting faster on the run?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nP.S. I have already done the Armstrong pull up program, it was nice, and really helped, although 100+ reps M-F gave me tendonitis in my elbow area.\nlivinIife: I run a 5K almost everyday and on long days I\u2019ll run more. I do 100 push-ups everyday and continuously increase my time for planks. I\u2019ll increase it by 10 seconds everyday. So I\u2019ll do 6:00 then last 2 sets are 30 seconds shorter (5:30). Increase that by 10 seconds everyday and you\u2019ll be golden on your planks. Then I do a 10 minute ab workout that hits all areas. Then I do a push pull leg split 2x a week. Instead"

The solution is supposed to be self-similar and the flow is split in three zones: an inner zone composed of burnt gases at rest, an intermediate zone where the solution is regular and the initial atmosphere composed of fresh gases at rest. The intermediate zone is bounded by the reactive shock (inner side) and the so-called precursor shock (outer side), for which Rankine-Hugoniot conditions are written; the solution in this zone is governed by two ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically. We show that, for any admissible precursor shock speed, the construction combining this numerical resolution with the exploitation of jump conditions is unique, and yields decreasing pressure, density and velocity profiles in the intermediate zone. In addition, the reactive shock speed is larger than the velocity on the outer side of the shock, which is consistent with the fact that the difference of these two quantities is the so-called flame velocity, i.e. the (relative) velocity"

The way I dealt with the work was always reading it as both an explanation of AND an exercise in deconstruction.  Along those lines, the second half where he really digs in to Rousseau is I suppose more the \"exercise in\" portion, where Derrida is taking the quasi-axiomatic he has set out to pick apart the blind spots in Rousseau.  As addressing the blind spots, the neglected theoretical gaps in the text, is the central work of deconstruction, you have to apply the same ethic that Derrida applies to Rousseau"

Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, decided to advance into Germany on a broad front in 1944, against the suggestions of his principal subordinates, Lieutenant Generals Omar Bradley and George S. Patton and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, who argued instead to stage competing advances on narrow fronts. The decision was controversial initially because the British government wanted to raise the profile of the minority British contingent in what was by then an overwhelmingly American army, and they perceived that a British-led thrust to Berlin would achieve this aim. Montgomery's strident advocacy raised political and nationalistic complications that strained the wartime alliance. During the subsequent Cold War, suggestions were made that the Soviet presence in Eastern Europe may have been reduced had Eisenhower sent a narrow-front thrust to race the USSR to Berlin in 1945.\nEisenhower's decision was based on both political and military factors. There were serious reservations in the autumn of 1944 about whether the Allied logistical system could support the narrow-front strategy, because"

They deduce it from the way you act and carry yourself around them.

This is particularly true in the case of exoplanets close to their stars, for which one has to account both for an (often intense) irradiation flux, and from an intrinsic flux responsible for the progressive loss of the inner planetary heat. The goals of the present work are to help understanding the coupling between radiative transfer and advection in exoplanetary atmospheres and to provide constraints on the temperatures of the deep atmospheres. This is crucial in assessing whether modifying assumed opacity sources and/or heat transport may explain the inflated sizes of a significant number of giant exoplanets found so far. I use a simple analytical approach inspired by Eddington's approximation for stellar atmospheres to derive a relation between temperature and optical depth valid for plane-parallel static grey atmospheres which are both transporting an intrinsic heat flux and receiving an outer radiation flux. The model is parameterized as a function of mean visible and thermal opacities, respectively. The model is shown to reproduce relatively well temperature profiles obtained from more"

I study the kinematics of clumpy galaxies at z~0.6, and compare their properties with those of counterparts at higher and lower redshifts. I selected a sample of 11 clumpy galaxies at z~0.6 from the representative sample of emission line, intermediate-mass galaxies IMAGES. Selection was based on rest-frame UV morphology from HST/ACS images, mimicking the selection criteria commonly used at higher redshifts. Their spatially-resolved kinematics were derived in the frame of the IMAGES survey, using the VLT/FLAMES-GIRAFFE multi-integral field spectrograph. For those showing large-scale rotation, I derived the Toomre Q parameter, which characterizes the stability of their gaseous and stellar phases. I find that the fraction of UV-selected clumpy galaxies at z~0.6 is 20+/-12%. Roughly half of them (45+/-30%) have complex kinematics inconsistent with Jeans-unstable disks, while those in the remaining half (55+/-30%) show large-scale rotations.

If your wheels lose grip on snow or ice, it doesn't matter how much power the engine can push to them, you're gonna slide until something stops you.\n\nThe benefit of 4 wheel drive vs. a 2 wheel drive vehicle is that you're less likely to get stuck in the snow if a single drive wheel loses traction. 4 wheel drive vehicles also have a bit more control than rear wheel drive vehicles because you're not going to be able to gun the engine and cause your rear wheels to suddenly spin faster than your front wheels"

Yes I do use the typical glasses cleaner with cloth wipe...\ncrhaxter: Optician here. The best way to clean them is with regular isopropyl alcohol. Try to keep it mostly on the lenses as it is a solvent and can discolor certain plastic frames. Use only a cotton or microfiber cloth, no paper towels. Dish soap can work too. After the initial cleaning, a new microfiber cloth should keep them streak free for awhile.\n\nEDIT: I like to use two cloths. One for cleaning with alcohol then let lenses dry, then use a clean one to remove all residue.\nAlso never use windex on a coated lens, it will destroy the coating.\n\nAnti-reflective (crizal) coatings are very helpful mainly for people with high prescriptions (3.00 diopters and above) but they do take more care than usual lenses. Before ordering the coating, decide if you are rough with glasses and if the coating will be worth getting. There is also a cosmetic component to the coating"

Long story short, she never returned it.\n\nHere are some things I have learned the costly way:\n\n1. If you can only afford to rent a room, avoid apartments. Most of the time, the tenants are subletting illegally. If they get caught, all of you can get evicted. Check with the landlord first. Don't just take the tenant's word for it. Renting a room in a house from the verified owner is a safer option. (Plus, if you ever have to sue the owner, and you win, you can put a lien on her real estate if she refuses to pay you.)\n\n2.

Little is known about the neuromuscular fatigability in CKD patients, defined as the reduction of muscle force capacities during exercise. Neuromuscular fatigability is a crucial physical parameter of the daily living. The quantification of explosive force has been shown to be a sensitive means to assess neuromuscular fatigability. Thus, our study used explosive force estimates to assess neuromuscular fatigability in elderly CKD patients. Methods Inclusion criteria for CKD patients were age $\\ge$ 60 years old and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 45 mL/ min/1.73 m 2 not on dialysis, and those for controls were GFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , age and diabetes matched. The fatigability protocol focused on a handgrip task coupled with surface electromyography (sEMG). Scalars were extracted from the rate of force development (RFD): absolute and normalized time periods (50, 75, 100, 150 and 200 ms, RFD 50 , RFD 75 , RFD 100 , RFD 150 and RFD 200 , respectively), peak RFD (RFD peak in absolute; NRFD peak normalized), timeto-peak RFD (t-RFD peak) and the relative force at RFD peak"

They were going to see the movie IT and cause they booked online they could choose what seats to sit at and then i asked if i could come and one of them say \"sorry i wouldn't be able to pay for you\" and I told him \"I could pay fpr myself\". But he then changed it to \"Oh we took the last seats\" which i found highly unlikely and so I didn't care. But the night before the movie I checked just in case and there was at lease 12 seats left and so i booked one for myself and I sat at the back of the theatre by my self watching it and I also saw them 2 rows in front of me. Also tonight it's one of my friends birthday party and I'm not invited but the thing is if i invite them to something it \"Oh i wouldn't be able to go cause i don't have money and they insist on me paying for them to do anything which i really dont like doing but becuase I'm to nice i do it anyway.

The primary goal is that someone answers and engages with whatever scam they're running i.e IRS, car warranty, Amazon purchase or whatever. \n\nHowever, the system also tracks anytime someone declines the call because that means it is a legitimate person's cell phone number as opposed to an out-of-service number or an office line. By declining, your number ends up in a database for future calls that can be more targeted or persistent. \n\nThe robo-caller groups frequently use this as a secondary revenue stream by selling the list of confirmed numbers to more sophisticated scammers. This also applies to \"replying STOP\" to scam text messages. \n\nBy ignoring it altogether, you don't provide the system any information and they're less likely to try your number again in the future.\n\nTL;DR Just let calls from unknown numbers ring instead of declining and just delete spam text messages.

Indeed, they can be maintained or denied independently of each other. And I think it is misleading to talk about these phenomena as varieties or kinds or manifestations or whatever of scientism. To me, kinds of scientism means something like kinds of the metaphilosophical view, or kinds of the attitude towards the humanities, etc.\n\n\nNow, I'm only interested in scientism about philosophy (or (1)).\n\nThe author seems to belong to the subset of philosophers we might call \"the guardians of the manifest image\".

The house had been a rental for most of its life and was aesthetically extremely rough.  \n\nFirst thing we did was cover up all the beige paint with Elemental from Home Depot prior to tearing out the old floors.  This way we didn't have to worry about paint drops or spills.  \n\nStarting with the kitchen, we cut out the drywall that the old tile backsplash was on, hung new drywall and installed a mosaic tile backsplash using Mussel Bound adhesive mat.  While we had the old backsplash and drywall out, I flipped the switch for the pantry light from outside the pantry to inside the pantry.  Since the door hinges on the side that the lightswitch was on, if you opened the door before turning on the light, you had to close the door again to reach the switch.  Not well thought out.  My wife painted the cabinets and I installed a new dishwasher.  We contracted the Quartz countertops and extended the overhang for the bar by about 6 inches and had the counterop guys install a single-basin undermount sink.  I put in the faucet and a new garbage"

Around 7 July 2021 I was 65kg 183cm and couldn't do 1 dip or pull up \nFast forward to now I can do at least 15 dips and 10 pull ups, hold an L Sit for about 4 secs \nCan do Tuck Lever,frog stand and skin the cat. Essentially early progressions. But what I found interesting or what the base of this post is, is that I bench pressed for the first time 3 months ago and wasn't consistent with it. I could barely do the bar as I was shaking alot, I eventually got 65 kg but now after 1 month and half consistently doing it I've found that I've increased it to 80 kg . My current stats are 183 cm 83 kg \n I'm not too sure if that's normal but I believe going into calisthenics first is the best, cause you'll come out of it with a base in calisthenics strength and probably be able to pick up some neat tricks along the way. Also you can carry over the strength into weightlifting"

The \"time out\" is not a punishment, but literally a time for the kid to get out of the poor behavior pattern and begin to relax. Discussion happens going into and coming out of time out.

Most of the time, the tenants are subletting illegally. If they get caught, all of you can get evicted. Check with the landlord first. Don't just take the tenant's word for it.

It is held by the National Gallery Prague, displayed at the Veletr\u017en\u00ed pal\u00e1c (Fair Trade Palace) in the district of Hole\u0161ovice, where the painting is known as Zelen\u00e9 obil\u00ed (\"Green wheat\").\nLike many similar works at this time, the landscape painting was made on a size 30 canvas and measures 73 cm \u00d7 93.5 cm (28.7 in \u00d7 36.8 in).  It depicts a field of largely green wheat with parts ripening to yellow.  A tall dark fastigiate cypress tree is at the centre of the scene, next to a small white house, with mountains in the background, and a blue sky with white clouds above. The painting was completed in 1889, while van Gogh was voluntarily incarcerated at the asylum of St. Paul near Saint-R\u00e9my in Provence.\n\nOn 16 June 1889, Vincent wrote to his sister Wil that he had just completed the painting, just a few days after he was allowed out to paint en plein air: Then yet another [landscape] that depicts a field of yellowing wheat surrounded by brambles and green bushes. At the end of the field a little pink house with a tall and dark cypress tree that"

I also suspect exercises of power and coercion may differ in subtle ways, esp. considering in considering whether or not power was exercised successfully. But I think the argument is generally worth considering and can shed some clarity on the concepts involved.\n\n(1) Rape is any instance of non-consensual sexual activity.\n\n(2) All sexual activity between men and women is actually non-consensual. \n\n(3) All sexual activity between men and women is rape.\n\nAs far as I know, (1) is pretty uncontroversial, so (2) is pretty much load-bearing and needs substantial defense.\n\nMy defense of (2) is that there is a difference between nominal consent (eg, saying \"yes\") and actual consent, which has to do with the ability to make genuine choices, and that actual consent is not fully possible when there is a difference in power between the two parties. (Another way of saying this might be that we are not always in a *position* to consent when giving nominal consent).\n\nThat nominal consent is"

I've seen a lot of bad hardwood floor jobs, and hopefully this will prevent some of those from happening.  The biggest problem I see with DIY hardwood floor finishing, is that people read an article online that says rent a drum sander and buy some poly from Home Depot. There's more to it than that, and if you follow those simplistic instructions, you're gonna end up with a refinished floor, but it's not going to be very nice, and it probably won't last long.\n\nAlso, note that I don't talk about installation in this, only refinishing.  Installation is a whole other article.  If there's interest, I'll post something on that.\n\n=====\nFirst off, do NOT use a drum sander. These things will leave the floor uneven and you'll be able to see it in the reflected light off the floor. A lot of the rentals have been abused and are out of adjustment and can leave gouges or lines in the floor also.  If you've never sanded a floor before, get one of the random orbital floor sanders that have 3 or 4 discs on the bottom"

Thus, you'll get people coming here that want to make a controversial post, but don't want to engage in a discussion.\n\nI think deleting the thread is a bad idea, since good discussion can still arise. Yet, i think banning OPs who abandon threads will help to encourage posters to stick around for the discussion, even if the OPs view remains unchanged.\n\nI think the options could be:\n\n* Giving the OP 24 hours to return to a thread.

It was released worldwide for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One on October 12, 2018. It is a sequel to the 2015 game Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the fifth entry in the Black Ops sub-series, and the 15th installment in the Call of Duty series overall.\nBlack Ops 4 is the first mainline Call of Duty title without a traditional single-player campaign mode. Instead, it features the Specialist HQ, which focuses on the backstories of the game's multiplayer characters, known as \"Specialists\". The missions take place between Black Ops II and III chronologically. Some of the Specialists also carried over from Black Ops III. The multiplayer mode is the first in the series to not feature automatic health regeneration and introduces both predictive recoil and a new ballistics system. The game included three Zombies experiences on release day, four if a special edition of the game, or the Black Ops Pass, was purchased. The locations of the maps include the RMS Titanic, a Gladiatorial Arena in Roman Egypt, and Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary"

This is so because there are general and definite rules for the change of subjective probabilities through information or experience; induction and belief change are one and same topic, after all. The most basic of these rules is simply to conditionalize with respect to the information received; and there are similar and more general rules. 1 Hence, a fundamental reason for the epistemological success of probability theory is that there at all exists a well-behaved concept of conditional probability. Still, people have, and have reasons for, various concerns over probability theory. One of these is my starting point: Intuitively, we have the notion of plain belief; we believe propositions2 to be true (or to be false or neither). Probability theory, however, offers no formal counterpart to this notion. Believing A is not the same as having probability 1 for A, because probability 1 is incorrigible3; but plain belief is clearly corrigible.

These resonances are defined as the eigenvalues of the generator (Kolmogorov operator) of a given stochastic system. By relying on the theory of Markov semigroups, decomposition formulas of correlation functions and power spectral densities (PSDs) in terms of RP resonances are then derived. These formulas describe, for a broad class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), how the RP resonances characterize the decay of correlations as well as the signal's oscillatory components manifested by peaks in the PSD.It is then shown that a notion reduced RP resonances can be rigorously defined, as soon as the dynamics is partially observed within a reduced state space V . These reduced resonances are obtained from the spectral elements of reduced Markov operators acting on functions of the state space V , and can be estimated from series. They inform us about the spectral elements of some coarse-grained version of the SDE generator. When the time-lag at which the transitions are collected from partial observations in V , is either sufficiently small or large, it is shown that the reduced RP resonances"

The simplest examples possess m states per site (m\\geq2), with nearest-neighbor interactions with U(m) symmetry, under which the sites transform alternately along the chain in the fundamental m and its conjugate representation \\bar{m}. We find that these spin chains, even with {\\em arbitrary} coefficients of these interactions, have a symmetry algebra A_m much larger than U(m), which implies that the energy eigenstates fall into sectors that for open chains (i.e., free boundary conditions) can be labeled by j=0, 1, >..., L, for the 2L-site chain, such that the degeneracies of all eigenvalues in the jth sector are generically the same and increase rapidly with j. For large j, these degeneracies are much larger than those that would be expected from the U(m) symmetry alone. The enlarged symmetry algebra A_m(2L) consists of operators that commute in this space of states with the Temperley-Lieb algebra that is generated by the set of nearest-neighbor interaction terms; A_m(2L) is not a Yangian.

The number of mobile devices has increased exponentially and data traffic has almost doubled every year. Undoubtedly, the rate of growth will continue to be rapid with the explosive increase in demands for data rates, latency, massive connectivity, network reliability, and energy efficiency. In order to manage this level of growth and meet these requirements, the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications network is envisioned as a revolutionary advancement combining various improvements to previous mobile generation networks and new technologies, including the use of millimeter wavebands (mm-wave), massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) multi-beam antennas, network densification, dynamic Time Division Duplex (TDD) transmission, and new waveforms with mixed numerologies. New revolutionary features including terahertz (THz) communications and the integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) can further improve the performance and signal quality for future 6G networks. However, despite the inevitable benefits of all these key technologies, the heterogeneous"

In both periods, gold Open Access made up the most common route. When comparing equal periods post and pre-law, we observed that the upward trend of gold Open Access was pre-existing to the legislation and the availability of closed articles in repositories increased by 5% to what is estimated based on existing trends. However, while the green route has had a positive evolution, it has been the publication in gold journals that has boosted access to Argentine production more"

        "text": "Object-oriented languages often use virtual machines (VMs) that provide mechanisms such as just-in-time (JIT) compilation and garbage collection (GC). These VM components are typically implemented in a separate layer, isolating them from the application. While this approach brings the software engineering benefits of clear separation and decoupling, it introduces barriers for both understanding VM behavior and evolving the VM implementation. For example, the GC and JIT compiler are typically fixed at VM build time, limiting arbitrary adaptation at run time. Furthermore, because of this separation, the implementation of the VM cannot typically be inspected and debugged in the same way as application code, enshrining a distinction in easy-to-work-with application and hard-to-work-with VM code. These characteristics pose a barrier for application developers to understand the engine on top of which their own code runs, and fosters a knowledge gap that prevents application developers to change the VM. We propose Live Metacircular Runtimes (LMRs) to overcome this problem. LMRs are language runtime systems that seamlessly integrate the VM into the application in live programming environments"

Why? because when you buy a car it loses value because it's no longer new, secondly just about after year when the next model releases it's now  not a new car anymore and never will be.

So if someone constantly teases a boy like you mentioned,  as a girl I think it's admirable when the boy doesn't react or shrugs it off.  It tells me he's confident but humble.

Draft inducer turns on, on call for heat to create a negative pressure (or positive sometimes) to close the pressure switch. (If ignitor does not light, your problem is at this step.)\n\n2. Once this pressure switch closes, the board acknowledges that it's OK to start the ignition sequence and sends power to the ignitor and eventually the gas valve. \n\n3. Once everything is lit, the flame sensor sends a signal to the board confirming that the burners are lit and it's OK to keep gas flowing.\n\n4.

You do need a single salt pod for the initial use, but you will just reuse the rim of it indefinitely after that. I took a used salt pod and trimmed the top ring off it with scissors, so it was just the top rim of the pod that fits into the holder. It is shaped somewhat like a capital letter \"D\". This piece of plastic is what holds the first sensor down. The sensor is a little square in the holding mechanism, near the hinges. I just leave the little plastic ring sitting in my Navage all the time and this sensor is taken care of. The second sensor is in the lid that you close to crush the salt pod. It is about in the middle of the lid and is again a square sensor. This one is a bit trickier because the lid has to be beyond a certain angle for this trigger to take, but if you put the lid about halfway down, then poke the sensor with your finger, you will feel it catch, and you should be able to close the lid the rest of the way and use the machine; the suction should start, and the motor should engage.\n\n**The solution:**\n\nI make my own"

Also works if the sum of the two numbers are greater than 10. 11 x 39, 3 + 9 = 12, 3 + 1 = 4, 429.\n* If multiplying by 5, multiply the number by 10 and divide it by 2 instead, since 5 = 10/2. 36 \\* 5 can be rewritten as 36 \\* (10/2), 360/2 = 180.\n* If multiplying by a square of 2, just multiply by 2 until you equal that number. 28 x 8 can be rewritten as 28 x 2 x 2 x 2.

To provide some useful information on how the injury happened:\n\nFirst exercise in the workout I did was pull ups for 5 sets. The sets looked like 8-8-7-7-6 and 8 is the most reps I can do in a set so I was pushing myself pretty hard. This is the first time I tried arch body technique which I think is why the injury happened. Before I had been doing only hollow body pull ups which is more beginner friendly. Hollow body pull ups use more of your lats. Arch body puts more work on your upper back than the lats, which are way bigger so they can take more stress. Anyways, the injury actually occured in my next exercise which was chin ups. It's not because I did pull ups and followed that with chin ups, I have done that many times before with no problems and I used only hollow body technique. So the take away is beginners should only use hollow body and avoid arch body before reaching 10-12 reps of pull ups. And before building proper proprioception and mind-muscle connection.\n\nI need to give it time to recover but I also don't want to stop working. I have"

Never in human history did so many people slaughter one another in the name of so many ideologies and visions of progress, all of them informed by a post-religious secular ideology - whether it was the quasi-paganism of Nazism or the atheism of the Soviet Union, China or Cambodia. If the Enlightenment signified the liberation of western societies from the tyranny of religion and theocratic rule, we discovered in the 20th century that the cruelty of God-fearing societies might be rivalled only by that of godless societies. \n\nSomething about this bothered me. The 20th century societies weren't cruel because they were godless. In fact their godlessness had little to do with their overreaching ideology, and more to do with those in power not wanting to compete with religion for control. Though in the case of Nazi Germany you had religious institutions actively preaching against Jews in many cases.\n\nComparatively though many of the atrocities of the previous \"god-fearing\" societies were a direct result of"

By this act, effectively, DZI merged the active insurance companies into a bigger one. The state insurance control also ended its activity because the functions of the insurance control were transferred to DZI too.\nDZI was created by this law as an autonomous company, juridical entity, with headquarters in Sofia and with a complex structure, functioning in this way until 1952 when the establishment of branches and gradual decentralisation of the Institutes activity began.\nDZI functioned"

Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of multivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular, the diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite naturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum Parsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the analyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve the major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their discretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an unsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction How do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform themselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to present-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout the Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between these, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract some digestible information from the complexity of these systems"

TypeState-Oriented Programming (TSOP) is a paradigm intended to help developers in the implementation and use of mutable objects whose public interface depends on their private state. Under this paradigm, well-typed programs are guaranteed to conform with the protocol of the objects they use. Inquiry. Previous works have investigated TSOP for both sequential and concurrent objects. However, an important difference between the two settings still remains. In a sequential setting, a well-typed program either progresses indefinitely or terminates eventually. In a concurrent setting, protocol conformance is no longer enough to avoid deadlocks, a situation in which the execution of the program halts because two or more objects are involved in mutual dependencies that prevent any further progress. Approach. In this work, we put forward a refinement of TSOP for concurrent objects guaranteeing that well-typed programs not only conform with the protocol of the objects they use, but are also deadlock free.

Yes, random number generators spit out a \"random\" number, but there was a direct cause to the generation of said number. Radioactive decay? Not as random as scientists once thought. You can actually predict it using the [Law of Large Numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Large_Numbers).

Their goal is to detect certain properties such as the small-world or scale-free properties. Previous works have shown some of these properties are present in many different systems, while others are characteristic of certain types of systems only. However, each one of these studies generally focuses on a very small number of topological measures and networks. In this work, we aim at using a more systematic approach. We first constitute a dataset of 152 publicly available networks, spanning over 7 different domains. We then process 14 different topological measures to characterize them in the most possible complete way. Finally, we apply standard data mining tools to analyze these data.

The primary goal is that someone answers and engages with whatever scam they're running i.e IRS, car warranty, Amazon purchase or whatever. \n\nHowever, the system also tracks anytime someone declines the call because that means it is a legitimate person's cell phone number as opposed to an out-of-service number or an office line. By declining, your number ends up in a database for future calls that can be more targeted or persistent. \n\nThe robo-caller groups frequently use this as a secondary revenue stream by selling the list of confirmed numbers to more sophisticated scammers. This also applies to \"replying STOP\" to scam text messages. \n\nBy ignoring it altogether, you don't provide the system any information and they're less likely to try your number again in the future.\n\nTL;DR Just let calls from unknown numbers ring instead of declining and just delete spam text messages.

This is a rare condition, previously reported in only four families. In contrast, heterozygous GRN mutations are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia associated with neuronal cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. We identified homozygous GRN mutations in six new patients. The phenotypic spectrum is much broader than previously reported, with two remarkably distinct presentations, depending on the age of onset. A childhood/juvenile form is characterized by classical CLN11 symptoms at an early age at onset. Unexpectedly, other homozygous patients presented a distinct delayed phenotype of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism after 50 years; none had epilepsy or cerebellar ataxia.

The difference is that culture was, as is today, shoehorned into the role of a blanket term for national/religious identies, which are still as non-uniform as the people of any given nation. E.g. - I grew up in Texas in the suburbs. There is absolutely nothing to bond me to anyone from the rural panhandle"

For that purpose, we recast the two rolling problems within the framework of geometric control and associate to each of them a distribution and a control system.

This phenomenon is phased-matched through the relative phase detuning between the intracavity fields associated with the two principal polarization modes of the cavity. Our experimental investigation is based on a 12-m long fiber ring resonator in which a polarization controller is inserted to finely control the level of intra-cavity birefringence. Depending on the amount of birefringence, the temporal patterns generated via PMI are found to be either stationary or to exhibit a period-doubled dynamics. Experimental results are in good agreement with numerical simulations based on an Ikeda map for the two orthogonally polarized modes. Our study provides new insights into the control of modulation instability in multimode Kerr resonators. Modulation instability (MI) is a nonlinear phenomenon characterized by the exponential growth and evolution of periodic perturbations on top of an intense continuous-wave (cw) laser beam [1, 2].

Forming effective coalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems. Central to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many possible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually requires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the coalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it was formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a combination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one coalition, and by which the overall outcome of the system is maximized. However, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging due to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows exponentially with the number of agents involved.

We experimentally study this case, launching a non-interacting 39 K Bose-Einstein condensate in a 1D disordered potential induced by a far-off-resonance laser speckle, while controlling a bias force. In agreement with theoretical predictions, we observe a transition between algebraic localization and delocalization as a function of our control parameter that is the relative strength of the disorder against the bias force. We also demonstrate that the initial velocity of the wave-packet only plays a role through an effective disorder strength due to the correlation of the disorder. Adding a bias force is a quite natural way to probe the transport properties of quantum systems, a subject of broad interest that can be in particular addressed with atomic quantum gases thanks to their high degree of control and versatility [1].

This matched the tradition the established National Football League had adhered to for decades. In the NFL, which the AFL was directly competing against, the Eastern champion hosted title games in even-numbered years. To preclude the possibility of having to compete with an NFL title game in close proximity for an audience, AFL owners initially agreed that its Western champions would host in even numbered"

Fast recompilation enables cheap experimentation with changes to a project, as those changes can be tested quickly. Separate and incremental compilation has been a topic of interest for a long time to facilitate fast recompilation. Inquiry: Despite the benefits of an incremental compiler, such compilers are usually not the default. This is because incrementalization requires cross-cutting, complicated, and error-prone techniques such as dependency tracking, caching, cache invalidation, and change detection. Especially in compilers for languages with cross-module definitions and integration, correctly and efficiently implementing an incremental compiler can be a challenge. Retrofitting incrementality into a compiler is even harder. We address this problem by developing a compiler design approach that reuses parts of an existing non-incremental compiler to lower the cost of building an incremental compiler. It also gives an intuition into compiling difficult-to-incrementalize language features through staging.

In such cases, the monotonicity assumptions that are frequently made in the theory of mean field games do not hold, and uniqueness cannot be expected in general. Such model lead to systems of forward-backward nonlinear nonlocal parabolic equations; the latter are supplemented with various kinds of boundary conditions, in particular Neumann-like boundary conditions stemming from reflection conditions on the underlying controled stochastic processes. The present work deals with numerical approximations of the above mentioned systems. After describing the finite difference scheme, we propose an iterative method for solving the systems of nonlinear equations that arise in the discrete setting; it combines a continuation method, Newton iterations and inner loops of a bigradient like solver. The numerical method is used for simulating two examples. We also make experiments on the behaviour of the iterative algorithm when"

As an example of this, it is perfectly empirical that no experience is strictly identical to any other because of each one's distinct heterogeneity, therefore if one is to posit one's being, it must be a being of at least a two (multiple). Even forms like Deja Vu are multiplicities because while one experiences a sensation of the present and past in unity, it cannot be put into language without the category of time, which implies a multiplicity.\n\nThe problem of completion is at issue because if being is not infinitesimal, but multiple (for example, there are no 'infinitesimal' particles in physics that I know of), it has a limit, but perhaps can actually reach this limit instead of only approaching it.

There is the onset of local thermodynamic disequilibrium, which manifests as velocity slip and temperature jump [1-4] at the wall.

He adores using the monkey bars we got our kids for Christmas and challenges himself constantly. Sometimes we enforce time off the bars due to his hands being covered in callouses and blisters!! \n\nOne day while having time off the bars he was balancing on a wobble cushion. He got past a minute on each leg. I suggested he try balance on a ball never thinking he'd be able. He hopped on a kid size soccer ball and balanced (both feet) for well over a minute. We were laughing and I was saying it was crazy he could do it so long. For fun, I threw a soft ball at him to set him off balance, but he caught it. So my husband suggested he pass it round his waist while balancing, which he did, no worries. My husband and I are flabbergasted.\n\nHe is loving these fun challenges but I'm a bit stumped. I'm not interested in making him exercise as such, he's only 8 and he plays so hard, the last thing he needs is \"exercises\". But I am looking for resources for interesting and age appropriate challenges I can suggest to him for fun. Any ideas"

First, the mathematical model, based on convective transport of moisture, the Optimal Experiment Design (OED) and the experimental set-up are presented. Then measurements of relative humidity within the material are carried out, after searching the OED, which is based on the computation of the sensitivity functions and a priori values of the unknown parameters employed in the mathematical model. The OED enables to plan the experimental conditions in terms of sensor positioning and boundary conditions out of 20 possible designs, ensuring the best accuracy for the identification method and, thus, for the estimated parameter. Two experimental procedures were identified: i) single step of relative humidity from 10% to 75% and ii) multiple steps of relative humidity 10-75-33-75% with an 8-day duration period for each step. For both experiment designs, it has been shown that the sensor has to be placed near the impermeable boundary.

This question is well understood in two classes of routing games. The first is the non-atomic routing introduced by Wardrop on 1952 in the context of road traffic in which each player (car) is infinitesimally small; a single car has a negligible impact on the congestion. Each car wishes to minimize its expected delay. Under arbitrary topology, such games are known to have a convex potential and thus a unique equilibrium. The second framework is splitable atomic games: there are finitely many players, each controlling the route of a population of individuals (let them be cars in road traffic or packets in the communication networks). In this paper, we study two other frameworks of routing games in which each of several players has an integer number of connections (which are population of packets) to route and where there is a constraint that a connection cannot be split. Through a particular game with a simple three link topology, we identify various novel and surprising properties of games within these frameworks. We show"

Aside from the obvious fact that people see enormous benefit in simply having dogs as companions, dogs also serve as guides for the blind, aids to people with disabilities, can detect seizures and panic attacks before they hit and warn their owners, help screen for toxic and harmful substances (bomb sniffing dogs), can be used to herd and protect livestock, and can even detect cancer and other conditions in humans.

Firstly, is the term Multiverse and the idea that parallels to this universe exist indicated by the Higgs Boson both miss the hard definition for universe(this is so common in pop physics), that if the verses are multi they are included in the concept 'Universe' or 'realm of all things', also that since the Higgs Boson indicates the possibility of multiple parallels to our classic newtonian universe sort of debunks the idea that we could never have access to these verses in the multi, since if they were truly paralell there would be no indication ever. Secondly, the idea that 'Nature' or what is 'natural' has to do with what's tangible or harmonious is just besides the point. Nature is just what is natural to the universe (the nature of all things is called Nature), so if nature is not harmonious then doesn't mean that the Universe is not natural, but that we must think 'natural' differently. In the end, I don't think Einstein is so off to say 'God does not play dice with the universe', theological"

In a viral marketing campaign, a firm initially targets a small set of pioneers and hopes that they would influence a sizeable fraction of the population by diffusion of influence through the network. In general, any marketing campaign might fail to go viral in the first try. As such, it would be useful to have some guide to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign and judge whether it is worthy of further resources, and in case the campaign has potential, how to hit upon a good pioneer who can make the campaign go viral. In this paper, we present a diffusion model developed by enriching the generalized random graph (a.k.a. configuration model) to provide insight into these questions. We offer the intuition behind the results on this model, rigorously proved in Blaszczyszyn & Gaurav(2013), and illustrate them here by taking examples of random networks having prototypical degree distributions - Poisson degree distribution, which is commonly used as a kind of benchmark, and Power Law degree distribution, which"

At very high resistance (and thus, slow speed) we still train power, and at light resistance and fast speed, we are still training strength (as long as you're having to produce a force to increase or maintain that speed).\n\nAs with everything else in resistance training, specificity is key. We get stronger, and more powerful, at the speeds that we train at. Furthermore, we get stronger at those speeds for the specific muscle lengths (and thus joint angles) that we train at. So if you move fast from the bottom of a pull up, but then move slowly after that, you're going to get stronger at moving quickly during the bottom of the pull up only, you won't magically get stronger and faster at the top angles.\n\nThe adaptation at each speed and joint angle is going to be proportional to the effort we put in relative to our maximum ability.

Going through the new and improved (I assume) RR, I ran across the Deadbug excercise. For me very timely because I have also become more serious about singing, and a lot of what Nick-E writes in his tutorial, especially the parts about breathing, is exactly what my singing teacher is telling me I need to focus on. It did lead to some questions, though. I wasn't sure whether this was the right sub to ask, but I figured that singers who actually exercised their intrinsic core muscle groups would be here. ;-)  \n1. My primary focus would currently be less core strength and more core endurance. Are there any other core exercises that train endurance or is deadbug all the way to go, just holding longer and longer?     \n2. I have become a bit obsessed with breathing the right away while engaging the core. I tried while running this morning and am not sure I actually got it.

A little about me for reference: I'm a one-time marathoner with a naturally stocky build, currently with about 20-30 lbs more than my frame should handle. I'm 34, about 5'7\", 195 lbs ~21-22% bodyfat. My body is really unbalanced in terms of strength such that I can max out any squat machine easily, but my upper body is really weak. Onto the questions:\n\n* After I got the pullup bar, I managed one decent set of negatives (shooting for 3-seconds per rep). Since then, my arms seem to be too fatigued to do much else but jump off a stool and drop. I'm wondering if people think it's better to just add more time in between workouts, to try and use my legs as assists (essentially pulling as hard as I can while slowly squatting), or something else. Obviously, losing weight would help with this and that's in process. But I'd like to work on pullups in the meantime.\n\n* How married should I be to doing the whole routine 3x per week?

Our algorithms provide not just coverage of a new expressive class, but also alternatives to previous algorithms for implementing the previously covered class (?layered?) of prioritization.

Next time you're way too eager for a hot cookie and obliterate your mouth with its delicious, piping hot gooeyness, be sure to cure it with sugar. \n\nThis trick works every time for me-- I'm fairly certain it has something to do with the enzyme amylase, which digests sugars in your mouth. It cures a burn almost immediately, allowing you to go about your day as if you had never taken that regrettable bite/ sip of the regrettably hot snack.\n\nOnce you burn your tongue, or any other part of your mouth, open your mouth so that it can have some access to air. \n\n-Coat the area of your burn with sugar (brown or white). Be extremely generous with the sugar. \n\n-Keep your mouth open/ tongue out, because this ensures that the sugar stays put and doesn't get swallowed. \n\nAfter about a minute, or longer if you wish, you're pretty much good to go.

I understand the draw of organic produce but I don't see how it's more sustainable.\nbizaromo: A lot of the talk about organic being more sustainable is back-to-nature hype. However, organic farming does have fewer chemical inputs into the land, which causes less strain on the environment. There are tighter restrictions on pesticides, herbicides, and no synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. This is beneficial to the environment because there is less groundwater pollution from organic crops ([nitrogen runoff is a big problem](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fertilizer-runoff-overwhelms-streams/)). Because organic farmers can't just dump on more nitrogen when the soil is depleted, they are more reliant on using crop rotation, compost, cover crops, etc. \n\nAlso, the limits on pesticide use mean that organic farms aren't in an evolutionary arms race of pesticide vs pest... Whereas pesticide use in conventional farming has led to the spread of [pests"

        "text": "[deleted]: CMV: all domestic dogs should be exterminated / eliminated from our planet\n[removed]\nI_am_the_night: Okay, so you're making a lot of assumptions and leaps, here.\n\nFirst, with regard to cleanliness, dogs are known to be dirty, and people still consider them worth it even when they have to clean them.  Serious infections caused by dogs are quite rare, the case you linked to is a pretty unusual incident.  It's worth noting that you can theoretically get flesh eating bacteria from a handrail in many US cities, so unless you want to get rid of all handrails too, I'm not sure how this justifies the extermination of an entire species.\n\nSecond, dogs are used for way more than just hunting.  Aside from the obvious fact that people see enormous benefit in simply having dogs as companions, dogs also serve as guides for the blind, aids to people with disabilities, can detect seizures and panic attacks before they hit and warn their owners, help screen for toxic and harmful substances (bomb sniffing dogs), can be used to herd and protect livestock, and can even detect cancer and other conditions in humans.  That's not even a complete list, dogs are some of the most useful and helpful animals"

Haven\u2019t had time to make the video yet and I wanted to go ahead and get it out in written form so I will go over the general plan here which you can apply to your own training and I will also cover how I use it myself. I originally made this routine using information I learned through reading Overcoming Gravity, and polished it by consulting with the book\u2019s author, Steven Low.\n\nThis is focused on progression for intermediate gymnastics strength trainees who are on the larger side (&gt;180lbs, &gt;6\u2019). Those are not hard limits, but the further you are below them, I\u2019d only say this would be helpful if you were closer to the advanced/elite skills.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nI will first preface by saying that I am not a licensed personal trainer, nor am I a medical professional, so by using my program or any program for that matter you are doing so at your own risk. This program is for an intermediate to advanced trainee, and you should have"

Also, growling doesn\u2019t necessarily equal aggression and raised hackles are an involuntary response much like goosebumps...also not a defacto sign of aggression!\n **Why YSK**\\- correctly interpreting a dog's body language can help you interact appropriately with dogs- knowing when you can approach/interact safely, when more information/context is needed, and know when to stay back or stay away to avoid escalating a dog's stress level.\n\nMany people incorrectly believe that a wagging tail is a sign of contentment, happiness or happy excitement in a dog but dogs wag their tails for a variety reasons. Speed of wag, tail position, and wag motion can give you clues as to whether a wag is friendly or not, and you should ALWAYS look at the dog\u2019s whole body language for signs of how they\u2019re feeling, not just the wag.\n\nA dog growling is a dog letting you know that it is scared, nervous, or uncomfortable about a given situation. Again, context and whole-body language is critical. If a growling dog is backing away with its tail tucked, it\u2019s scared, not aggressive!\n\nFinally, raised hackles"

It seems to me that in the grand scheme of things, the one thing that could be most destructive to any government's (including our own) power is too many happy citizens. Yeah, it sounds ridiculous but hear me out. A happy person is for the most part content. He/she wants for very little and sees little value in expensive possessions. Less consumerism equals less economic growth plain and simple, but there's a sinister side to this all I think. We all know corporate fat-cats collaborate and meet with government officials. Lobbyists appeal to them and try to get legislation to work for them rather than the country as a whole so already we see a merging between government and big business. These same businesses run advertisements for products, dictate what stories to put on the news and what details to reveal, put chemicals into our environment and food sources, etc. In effect, the two are scratching each others' backs. Big news corporations keep the public blind to what the government does while injecting fear and violence directly into our world. Terrorist attacks, school-shootings"

However, when people confuse the two it shows ignorance. So, I'm going to try to drop some knowledge on ya!\n\nFirst, you need to know what insulin is. Insulin, released by the pancreas, is the hormone the body uses to take sugar out of the blood (where it is transported) and into cells that need it. This is usually skeletal muscle cells - so your muscles. Most things that you eat are converted into glucose (sugar) for use the body. Sweet foods, Carbohydrates, protein (sometimes), etc.\n\n\nSo there are three different types of diabetes. Type I, Type II, and gestational. Ill be focusing on the first two. The word \"diabetes\" comes from Greek, and it literally means excessive discharge of urine. This is one of the symptoms of diabetes. The excess urination (polyuria) is due to high sugar levels in the blood. High sugar is actually toxic to the individual, so the body - specifically kidneys- attempts to rid the elevated glucose levels, and its end product is urination. Other symptoms are excessive hunger (polyphagia) and excessive thirst (polydipsia"
