As a result, I started reserving parking spots for him whenever we go out. It's not about being selfish or trying to get special treatment; it's about being a responsible and caring son. I know that there are people who might disagree with my actions, but I believe that it's our duty to help those in need, especially when it comes to something as simple as parking.

I've noticed that some people have started to reserve parking spots for their own convenience, and that's not what this is about. This is about making a difference in someone's life, even if it's just a small one. My father's accident was a wake-up call for me, and it made me realize that we should all strive to be kind and compassionate towards others.

I understand that some people might see reserving parking spots as a selfish act, but I believe that it's a small sacrifice to make for someone who has given so much to me and my family. My father has always been there for me, supporting me through thick and thin, and this is the least I can do for him. It's not about me; it's about showing my appreciation for everything he's done for me.

It all depends on where you are from. The cones I take are always at the side of the road and almost always on their side and they look like they've been thrown aside. I never take it if it's where it is for a reason, like a construction site or to warn of something on/in the road. I know you can just buy them, but I was just relaying my experience that there's almost always cones lying there, for no reason. My father can never find a space close enough on the street, no matter if there's a meter or not. I always do it on a side street,  so as to not stop the flow of traffic on the main street. I don't know how I could've made it clearer that I don't ever do this to prevent others from doing anything. Someone can, and this has happened, move the cones and park where they were. People in really big cities do this all time to reserve their spot in front of their house. Again, nobody stops others from moving the cones, but they realize that they're there for a reason and ignore them. I don't think that orange cones are exclusive to construction, either. They're just there to help guide traffic, which I do, I guide traffic away from the spot where I want to park a car. I don't want to keep replying to this thread, so I'm just ignoring it from now on, because I have much better things to do with my energy.

We'd paint over it and let the inspector find them, and we'd explained what happened and we'd tried to get rid of them but there were so many and so deep that more shrinkage must have occurred after the paint was applied.

Needless to say, that dude was called on and fired. Every closet was reinspected and the ones that were found to have the offending message got torn out and redone.

Not exactly fair to him as he understandably felt burned for losing his nail gun, but really it's one thing to throw extra nails into a board and yet another to go so far as nailing out ""FUCK YOU"" in several houses.


CafeSilver: As someone who bought a house where the previous owner went way overboard with finish nails I have just one thing to say: fuck that guy.  I completely feel your pain.  In the end we just ripped all the trim out in the entire house because what they had was plain and boring.  The new trim easily cost over a thousand dollars and we spent at least 100 hours painting it, cutting it, and installing it.  Well worth it though.
psychonavigator: It was funny because I felt for the guy at first, and it was a fucked up situation to have builders, sparkies, paint jockeys and plumbers all trying to work around each other, but fuck man, secure your tools, don't walk away from them ever.

It's always funny when I see too many nails in an area, especially on trim, it's a sure sign that the last person didn't know wtf they were doing.
CafeSilver: Typically it means they can't find the stud. All you need to do is find one stud, then find the distance to the next and then from there it's really easy. A cheap ten dollar stud finder makes it even easier.

The first phase of the radio emission was characterized by a brightening of the lower source, which was accompanied by a gradual increase in intensity of the upper source. This phase was observed to last for approximately 10 minutes, during which time the radio emission showed a gradual decrease in intensity. The second phase of the radio emission was characterized by a sudden brightening of the upper source, which was accompanied by a sudden increase in intensity of the lower source. This phase was observed to last for approximately 5 minutes, during which time the radio emission showed a gradual decrease in intensity.

The radio emission of the surge was observed to be polarized, with a degree of polarization of approximately 20%. The polarization was observed to be highest in the frequency range of 45-60 MHz, and lowest in the frequency range of 60-80 MHz. The observed polarization properties of the radio emission are consistent with the presence of a magnetic field in the surge, which is likely to be responsible for the observed polarization.

The detection of metric radio emission from a surge provides new insights into the physics of solar flares and the mechanisms that govern the release of energy during these events. The observation of radio emission from a surge is consistent with the idea that the energy release during a solar flare is accompanied by the acceleration of particles, which can produce radio emission through the synchrotron mechanism. The detection of radio emission from a surge also provides a new diagnostic tool for studying the properties of solar flares and the mechanisms that govern the release of energy during these events."," range of 445.0 to about 300MHz, whereas a spectral component of different nature was observed at lower frequencies. Sub-second time variations were detected in both sources during both phases, with 0.2-0.3s a delay of the upper source with respect to the lower, suggesting superluminal velocities. This effect can be explained if the emission of the upper source was due to scattering of radiation from the source at the base of the surge. In addition, the radio emission showed signs of pulsations and spikes. We discuss possible emission mechanisms for the slow time variability component of the lower radio source. Gyrosynchrotron emission reproduced fairly well the characteristics of the observed total intensity spectrum at the start of the second phase of the event, but failed to reproduce the high degree of the observed circular polarization as well the spectra at other instances. On the other hand, type IV-like plasma emission from the fundamental could explain the high polarization and the fine structure in the dynamic spectrum; moreover, it gives projected radio source positions on the plane of the sky, as seen from STEREO-A, near the base of the surge. Taking everything into consideration, we suggest type IV-like plasma emission with a low intensity gyrosynchrotron component as the most plausible mechanism."

The phenol coefficient has been widely used in the past to compare the disinfecting power of different substances, including phenol, formaldehyde, and chlorine. However, with the development of more modern and sensitive methods for measuring antimicrobial activity, the use of the phenol coefficient has largely been superseded. Nevertheless, the principles upon which it is based are still used today in the development and testing of new disinfectants and antimicrobial agents.

In addition to its use in the development of disinfectants, the phenol coefficient has also been used in the study of microbial ecology and the behavior of microorganisms in different environments. For example, researchers have used the phenol coefficient to study the effects of different environmental factors, such as temperature and pH, on the growth and survival of microorganisms. The coefficient has also been used to study the interactions between microorganisms and their environments, including the effects of disinfectants and antimicrobial agents on microbial communities.

Overall, the phenol coefficient remains an important tool in the study of antimicrobial activity and the development of new disinfectants and antimicrobial agents. While it may no longer be widely used in its original form, the principles upon which it is based continue to be relevant and important in the field of microbiology."," the organism under the same conditions (or, probably more common, dividing the dilution factor at which the tested substance shows activity by the dilution factor at which phenol shows comparable activity). The Rideal–Walker test was widely used, but the test conditions chosen were unrealistic, and impossibly high values for the coefficient were claimed by disinfectant manufacturers. Distinguished bacteriologist Sir Ashley Miles, reviewing the subject, described the test as ""...at best a grossly over-simplified answer to a difficult problem and, at worst little short of bacteriological prostitution"".  Modifications were made by Dame Harriette Chick and Sir Charles James Martin in 1908. They used more realistic conditions, including 3% sterile faeces to mimic the conditions in which many disinfectants were used. The Chick–Martin test was then widely used until replaced by more suitable tests not reliant on phenol and reflecting the conditions  in which modern disinfectants are used.
Calculations by Harriette Chick showed that the killing of bacteria by disinfectants followed first order kinetics. So, the bactericidal activity of a particular disinfectant at a given concentration can be expressed as a constant (k) calculated by employing the formula k = N/C·T where N is the number of surviving cells, C is the concentration of agent applied and T is the time for which the agent is applied, so k is inversely proportional to dose (C·T is collectively called dose). 
One way to compare disinfectants is to compare how well they do against a known disinfectant and rate them accordingly using the Phenol coefficient. The disinfectant to be tested is compared with phenol on a standard microbe (usually Salmonella typhi or Staphylococcus aureus). Disinfectants that are more effective than phenol have a coefficient greater than 1; those that are less effective have a coefficient less than 1."

This result has far-reaching implications for the study of stochastic filtering, as it provides a framework for analyzing the behavior of the filter in response to changing observation data. Furthermore, it has been shown that this continuous dependence on the observed data is a fundamental property of the filter, and is not unique to the case of independent signal and noise. In fact, it has been demonstrated that this property holds even in the presence of correlated signal and noise, provided that the correlation is not too strong.

The continuous dependence of the filter on the observed data has important consequences for the design and implementation of filtering algorithms. For example, it allows for the development of adaptive filtering schemes, which can adjust their parameters in response to changes in the observation data. This is particularly important in applications where the signal and noise characteristics are time-varying, such as in wireless communication systems or in signal processing applications where the signal is subject to varying levels of interference.

In addition to its applications in signal processing and communication systems, the continuous dependence of the filter on the observed data has also been studied in other areas, such as in the theory of stochastic processes and in the study of random fields. In these areas, the result has been used to analyze the behavior of stochastic processes and random fields, and to develop new methods for analyzing and simulating these systems.

B) The ""ugliness"" of Socratic thought is also reflected in the way it has been used to justify the oppression of marginalized groups. Nietzsche argues that Socrates' philosophy has been used to justify the subjugation of women, slaves, and other groups, and that it has contributed to the perpetuation of a patriarchal and oppressive society.

C) The ""ugliness"" of Socratic thought is also reflected in its lack of emphasis on individual creativity and self-expression. Nietzsche argues that Socrates' philosophy has been overly focused on the pursuit of wisdom and the attainment of knowledge, and has neglected the importance of individual creativity and self-expression.

D) The ""ugliness"" of Socratic thought is also reflected in its lack of emphasis on the importance of the body and the senses.

Our proposed method, which we call ""RankReveal,"" uses a combination of machine learning and data analysis techniques to identify the key factors that influence the ranking decisions. By analyzing large datasets of ranked entities, we can identify patterns and correlations that are not immediately apparent from the raw data. This allows us to develop a model that can accurately predict the ranking outcomes, even when the internal logic of the ranking scheme is unknown.

One of the key advantages of our approach is that it can be applied to a wide range of ranking schemes, from those used in academia to those used in industry. This is because our method is based on general principles of data analysis and machine learning, rather than specific assumptions about the ranking scheme itself. This means that our approach can be adapted to different contexts and domains, making it a powerful tool for transparency and accountability in ranking decisions.

In addition to its practical applications, our approach also has important theoretical implications for the study of ranking schemes. By providing a deeper understanding of the underlying logic of these schemes, our method can help to shed light on the complex interactions between the stakeholders involved in the ranking process. This can lead to a better understanding of the ways in which ranking schemes shape our perceptions of the world and influence our decisions.

Overall, our proposed approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about ranking schemes and their role in shaping our decisions.

We realize this explanation paradigm for transparent ranking interpretation in TRIVEA, a visual analytic system that is fueled by: i) visualizations of model fit derived from algorithmic rankers that learn the associations between attributes and rankings from available data and ii) visual explanations derived from XAI methods that help abstract important patterns, like, the relative influence of attributes in different ranking ranges.

I've noticed that my core strength has improved significantly since I started doing these exercises, and I've been able to complete more difficult routes and boulder problems. But I've also noticed that my endurance has improved, and I'm able to recover faster between moves. This is probably due to the increased blood flow and oxygenation of the muscles, which is a direct result of the intense contractions and relaxations of the core muscles during the exercises.

One of the most significant benefits I've experienced is the increased power and explosiveness in my movements. I've been able to generate more force and speed in my climbing, which has allowed me to complete moves that I previously struggled with. This is especially noticeable when I'm bouldering, where a small amount of extra power can make all the difference between completing a move or falling off.

Another benefit I've experienced is improved balance and stability. The exercises have helped me develop a greater sense of awareness and control over my body, which has allowed me to maintain better balance and stability, even when I'm on difficult terrain. This has been especially helpful when I'm climbing outdoors, where the terrain can be unpredictable and the risk of falling is higher.

I've also noticed that my overall strength and muscle endurance have improved, which has allowed me to complete longer and more intense climbing sessions. This is probably due to the increased muscle mass and strength that I've developed through the exercises, as well as the improved endurance and recovery that I've experienced.

Overall, I've been extremely pleased with the results I've seen from doing these exercises. They've helped me improve my climbing and bouldering performance, increase my power and explosiveness, and improve my overall strength and endurance. I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking to improve their climbing and bouldering abilities."," out from the exertion and unable to finish the boulder problem. It's extra hard for me b/c I am semi-tall (6'1""), which means that on sit starts I am very scrunched up and have lots of legs and body in the way or hanging off the rock as I explode upward.

Few gym problems are designed to train this kind of move, but they're super common outdoors. (Or when they exist, they just aren't nearly as difficult and awkward as what I encounter outdoors.)

Do any of you have ideas for exercises that will help build *explosive* core power? Currently I do the RR about 3x/wk but do the bodyline drills daily. I think that training the front lever could help me a bit, but since it's not an explosive movement it can only help me so much. My only other idea so far is to do hanging leg lifts more explosively, but this will probably be pretty annoying b/c each set will require a lot of time to stop my momentum and reset. (Though on the other hand, maybe stopping my momentum will also mimic what you have to do on the rock once you've stuck the move?) I also wonder if deadlifts will help for this, though much of the power for this type of move has to come from abs, not lower back or hamstrings.

Maybe users like /u/eshlow and the climbers and gymnasts on this subreddit in particular will have some good ideas.
darrensurrey: Not BW but BB glute bridges?
ohneEigenschaften01: Interesting, but I think what I need is the exact inverse motion. I'm always open to non-BWF exercises.
darrensurrey: Are you sure? If so, hanging leg raises? V sits from lying on back?

I can't think how explosive core power would help a sit start.
ohneEigenschaften01: I understand your skepticism re core power for sit starts. I guess it came to me last weekend while I was in Bishop and really felt the strain in my core when I was trying these sit start kinds of moves--even ones with pretty positive hand holds. I think I felt it all over the core.

I mean, I have room to improve all over--finger strength, arm/shoulder strength, back strength, *technique*! But for the rest of these I know exactly how to work on it.
darrensurrey: Well, from an overhanging sit start you are trying to keep your feet from touching the ground but that does not require ""explosive"" core power. It requires you to just engage the core to keep your feet off the ground. If this is the case, then try hanging L-sits.

This allows for a more flexible and expressive representation of the automata, as it enables the automaton to recognize patterns and structures that are not explicitly defined.

The translucent letters can be used to model various types of ambiguity and uncertainty, such as the presence of unknown or unspecified characters in the input string. This can be particularly useful in applications where the input data is noisy or incomplete, and the automaton needs to be able to adapt to the uncertainty and ambiguity in the input. The translucent letters can also be used to model the presence of multiple possible interpretations or readings of the input string, allowing the automaton to recognize and distinguish between different possible meanings or interpretations.

In addition, the translucent letters can be used to model the presence of context-dependent or dependent rules, which are rules that are dependent on the current state or context of the automaton. This can be particularly useful in applications where the rules or patterns that need to be recognized are context-dependent, and the automaton needs to be able to adapt to the changing context and rules. The translucent letters can also be used to model the presence of exceptions or special cases, which are cases where the normal rules or patterns do not apply, and the automaton needs to be able to recognize and handle these exceptions.

Overall, the use of translucent letters in deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata provides a powerful and flexible tool for modeling and recognizing complex patterns and structures in input data, and can be particularly useful in applications where the input data is noisy, incomplete, or context-dependent."," be in one of the following categories: the automaton cannot see the letter (it is translucent), there is a transition defined on the letter (maybe more than one transitions in nondeterministic case) or none of the above categories (the automaton gets stuck by seeing this letter at the given state and this computation is not accepting). State-deterministic automata are recent models, where the next state of the computation determined by the structure of the automata and it is independent of the processed letters. In this paper our aim is twofold, on the one hand, we investigate state-deterministic finite automata with translucent letters. These automata are specially restricted deterministic finite automata with translucent letters. In the other novel model we present, it is allowed that for a state the set of translucent letters and the set of letters for which transition is defined are not disjoint. One can interpret this fact that the automaton has a nondeterministic choice for each occurrence of such letters to see them (and then erase and make the transition) or not to see that occurrence at that time. Based on these semi-translucent letters, the expressive power of the automata increases, i.e., in this way a proper generalization of the previous models is obtained."

I've also considered installing a drainage system, such as a French drain, to help remove any excess water that may accumulate on the floor. This could be especially important if the room doesn't have a proper drainage system in place.

Another option I've considered is using a waterproofing membrane on the walls and floor. This would provide an extra layer of protection against moisture and help prevent any damage to the drywall or flooring. I've heard that products like Damp Proofing Membrane (DPM) or waterproofing coatings can be effective in this regard.

I've also thought about installing a hot tub enclosure, which would help to contain the water and reduce the amount of moisture that enters the room. This could be a good option if I'm planning on using the hot tub frequently.

I'm also considering adding some ventilation to the room, as poor ventilation can exacerbate the moisture issues. Installing a dehumidifier or a ventilation system could help to remove excess moisture from the air and reduce the risk of mold and mildew growth.

Any other suggestions?
[deleted]: I think humidity damage is inevitable but you can take steps to minimize and reduce the damage.

* Proper flooring.   A nice tile or vinyl floor is going to be much more resistant than wood floor.


* Drywall - It will probably be fine as long as it's well painted.   You may want to re-paint and seal the drywall once a year with a bathroom rated paint.

* Ventilation - I would install a bathroom style fan that's rated for at least as many sq feet as your room and perhaps it's a good idea to oversize it.   Remember, for an exhaust fan you'll also need a place for fresh air to come in.   Have this fan on a timer.   Run it whenever the cover is off the tub and for 30-60 minutes after you put the cover on.

* More? - If water is going to be splashing directly on any drywall, it's probably not good.  Replace this drywall with tile, or something more resistant to moisture.
If you wanted to go real fancy you could finish much of the room in cedar like a sauna.   

* Caulking - If you anticipate lots of water on the floor, or on any place it might be wise to caulk places where the water might run.  I'm thinking like along the baseboards.

* Cleaning - Keep the place clean.  Mop up any standing water on the floor when you're done.


I think with some common sense you should have few problems.
 
xanderrobar: Thank you! This is some great advice. I hadn't considered that most solutions designed for bathrooms should similarly work for this hot tub room. 
thews: These are all good ideas, but definitely add some extra foundation where the hot tub will be.  And it would be best to tile the floor with enough slope to push water into a drain spot.  You wouldn't necessarily have to drain it into the sewer,  putting a P pipe on it and letting it slope off outside somewhere where it won't mess up the foundation would be okay.
xanderrobar: Is [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_%28plumbing%29) what you mean when you say ""P Pipe""? I would definietely have to do what you're suggesting, as this building has no water running to it. It has a fully separate electrical panel and a natural gas line with gas heater, but no water (and therefore no drainage into the sewer very easily). 
yoda2088: Afraid to click the link.
headed4thecrapper: p-pipe or a p-trap is just a p-shaped piece of pipe that holds water to prevent sewer gasses from coming out.

Might be good to tile the whole damn thing and put a floor drain in the middle so that any standing water has somewhere to go?

It is known that the boxicity of a graph $G$ is closely related to the dimension of the poset graph of the graph. In particular, $\boxi(G) \leq \dim(G_\poset)$. This is because we can construct a $k$-dimensional box for each vertex in $G$ by choosing the intervals $[a_1,b_1], [a_2,b_2], ..., [a_k,b_k]$ such that the boxes corresponding to two adjacent vertices intersect. This construction can be done in a way that the total number of intervals is at most $\dim(G_\poset)$. Therefore, we have $\boxi(G) \leq \dim(G_\poset)$. 

On the other hand, it is not known whether $\boxi(G) \geq \dim(G_\poset)$ in general. However, it is known that $\boxi(G) \geq \dim(G_\poset)$ for certain classes of graphs, such as chordal graphs and interval graphs. This is because these classes of graphs have a special structure that allows us to construct a $k$-dimensional box for each vertex in a way that the total number of intervals is at most $k$. 

In addition to the boxicity and dimension of a poset graph, there are other parameters that are used to study the structure of a graph or a poset. For example, the clique number of a graph is the size of the largest clique in the graph, and the chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Similarly, the dimension of a poset is the minimum number of total orders needed to express the poset, and the width of a poset is the maximum size of an antichain in the poset. 

The study of the boxicity and dimension of a graph or a poset has many applications in computer science and other fields. For example, the boxicity of a graph can be used to study the complexity of algorithms for solving problems on the graph, and the dimension of a poset can be used to study the complexity of algorithms for solving problems on the poset.","{underlying comparability graph} of $\poset$, i.e. $S$ is the vertex set and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are comparable in $\poset$. It is a well-known fact that posets with the same underlying comparability graph have the same dimension. The first result of this paper links the dimension of a poset to the boxicity of its underlying comparability graph. In particular, we show that for any poset $\poset$, $\boxi(G_\poset)/(\chi(G_\poset)-1) \le \dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$, where $\chi(G_\poset)$ is the chromatic number of $G_\poset$ and $\chi(G_\poset)\ne1$. It immediately follows that if $\poset$ is a height-2 poset, then $\boxi(G_\poset)\le \dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$ since the underlying comparability graph of a height-2 poset is a bipartite graph. The second result of the paper relates the boxicity of a graph $G$ with a natural partial order associated with the \emph{extended double cover} of $G$, denoted as $G_c$: Note that $G_c$ is a bipartite graph with partite sets $A$ and $B$ which are copies of $V(G)$ such that corresponding to every $u\in V(G)$, there are two vertices $u_A\in A$ and $u_B\in B$ and $\{u_A,v_B\}$ is an edge in $G_c$ if and only if either $u=v$ or $u$ is adjacent to $v$ in $G$. Let $\poset_c$ be the natural height-2 poset associated with $G_c$ by making $A$ the set of minimal elements and $B$ the set of maximal elements. We show that $\frac{\boxi(G)}{2} \le \dim(\poset_c) \le 2\boxi(G)+4$. These results have some immediate and significant consequences. The upper bound $\dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$ allows us to derive hitherto unknown upper bounds for poset dimension such as $\dim(\poset)\le 2\tw(G_\poset)+4$, since boxicity of any graph is known to be at most its $\tw+2$. In the other direction, using the already known bounds for partial order dimension we get the following: (1) The boxicity of any graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ is $O(\Delta\log^2\Delta)$ which is an improvement over the best known upper bound of $\Delta^2+2$. (2) There exist graphs with boxicity $\Omega(\Delta\log\Delta)$. This disproves a conjecture that the boxicity of a graph is $O(\Delta)$. (3) There exists no polynomial-time algorithm to approximate the boxicity of a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with a factor of $O(n^{0.5-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$, unless $NP=ZPP$."

Here are a few things that I've found helpful in improving my running efficiency and speed:

Firstly, I've focused on proper form and technique. This has helped me to run more efficiently and reduce my risk of injury. I've also made sure to incorporate strength training into my routine, focusing on exercises that target my core, glutes, and legs.

Secondly, I've incorporated hill sprints into my training. This has helped me to improve my explosive power and speed. I've found that sprinting uphill is a great way to build strength and endurance, and it's also a lot of fun!

Thirdly, I've tried to incorporate more high-intensity interval training into my runs. This has helped me to improve my anaerobic endurance and increase my speed. I've found that incorporating short bursts of high-intensity running into my runs has helped me to build up my endurance and increase my speed.

Lastly, I've tried to incorporate more stretching and foam rolling into my routine. This has helped me to reduce my risk of injury and improve my recovery. I've found that taking the time to stretch and foam roll after my runs has helped me to feel more relaxed and recovered, and it's also helped me to improve my performance.

Overall, I've found that a combination of proper form and technique, strength training, hill sprints, high-intensity interval training, and stretching and foam rolling has helped me to improve my running efficiency and speed. I hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in your own fitness journey!

As for your question about balancing running and lifting, I've found that it's all about finding a balance that works for you. For me, I've found that incorporating strength training into my routine 2-3 times a week has helped me to improve my running performance. I've also found that incorporating hill sprints and high-intensity interval training into my runs has helped me to improve my speed and endurance.

rockzn: Seems to me like you should work on your mental health. If you work out just to show other people that you're better and genuinely think you're a better human being because you work out you're actually shallow as fuck and to be frank straight up dumb or a jerk.

If it’s about core strength there are other holds that are simply more time efficient to do once you can hold a front plank for more than 4 minutes.

If you score high on the PT test they offer you airborne, ranger, or green beret contracts straight out of boot camp in the army, in addition to eventual sniper school, sapper training, and high speed units like 10th mountain, 101st airborne, or ranger bats.They don't put milk duds as shock troops or SF. There's nothing wrong with pushing himself, most people are too soft to stay disciplined and train.
rockzn: Alright sergeant but working out still doesn't automically make anyone a better human being and to show people up was kind off hinting at toxic training motivations. It’s a whole different ball if he's simply focussing on bettering himself. I also never stated that working out is useless especially in the context of military like that wasn't even the point of the comment you're referring to.

Recent experiments have focused on the detection of the $J^{\pi} = 3^{+}\_1$ state through the measurement of the decay properties of the $^{26}$F nucleus. The half-life of this state is expected to be relatively short due to the proximity of the continuum, making its detection challenging. However, the development of advanced detection techniques and the use of high-intensity beams have enabled the measurement of the decay properties of the $J^{\pi} = 3^{+}\_1$ state. The results of these experiments have provided valuable insights into the proton-neutron interaction in the $^{26}$F nucleus and have shed light on the role of the continuum in shaping the properties of this nucleus. 

The study of the $^{26}$F nucleus has also led to the development of new theoretical models that can describe the proton-neutron interaction in this nucleus. These models have been used to calculate the energies of the $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1 - 4^{+}\_1$ multiplet and have provided a good agreement with the experimental results. The development of these models has also enabled the prediction of the properties of other odd-odd nuclei, which can be studied using similar experimental techniques. 

In conclusion, the study of the $^{26}$F nucleus has provided valuable insights into the proton-neutron interaction in this nucleus and has shed light on the role of the continuum in shaping the properties of this nucleus. The development of new experimental techniques and theoretical models has enabled the measurement of the decay properties of the $J^{\pi} = 3^{+}\_1$ state and has provided a better understanding of the proton-neutron interaction in the $^{26}$F nucleus.","^{+}\_1$ is missing.Purpose: We wish to complete the study of the $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1 - 4^{+}\_1$ multiplet in $^{26}$F, by studying the energy and width of the $J^{\pi} =3^{+}\_1$ unbound state. The method was firstly validated by the study of unbound states in $^{25}$F, for which resonances were already observed in a previous experiment.Method: Radioactive beams of $^{26}$Ne and $^{27}$Ne, produced at about $440A$\,MeV by the FRagment Separator at the GSI facility, were used to populate unbound states in $^{25}$F and $^{26}$F via one-proton knockout reactions on a CH$\_2$ target, located at the object focal point of the R$^3$B/LAND setup. The detection of emitted $\gamma$-rays and neutrons, added to the reconstruction of the momentum vector of the $A-1$ nuclei, allowed the determination of the energy of three unbound states in $^{25}$F and two in $^{26}$F. Results: Based on its width and decay properties, the first unbound state in $^{25}$F is proposed to be a $J^{\pi} = 1/2^-$ arising from a $p\_{1/2}$ proton-hole state. In $^{26}$F, the first resonance at 323(33)~keV is proposed to be the $J^{\pi} =3^{+}\_1$ member of the $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1 - 4^{+}\_1$ multiplet. Energies of observed states in $^{25,26}$F have been compared to calculations using the independent-particle shell model, a phenomenological shell-model, and the ab initio valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group method.Conclusions: The deduced effective proton-neutron interaction is weakened by about 30-40\% in comparison to the models, pointing to the need of implementing the role of the continuum in theoretical descriptions, or to a wrong determination of the atomic mass of $^{26}$F."

PM_me_your_Jeep: Ah, good point about the sheetrock! I was trying to save a buck, but I guess that was a bad idea. I'll definitely keep an eye out for any cracks or issues. Do you think I should redo the whole thing with a proper backer board or is there a way to fix the corners and basin without tearing everything out again? And what's the best way to waterproof the seams and edges of the tile?

tjohn2018: Well, it's not the end of the world if you didn't use a proper backer board. But, as I said, it's not ideal for constant water exposure. If you're not planning on redoing the whole thing, you can try to fix the corners and basin by applying some additional waterproofing and re-grouting. But, I would recommend re-grouting the entire shower to ensure a proper seal. As for waterproofing the seams and edges of the tile, you can use a silicone-based sealant, such as SikaBond or Laticrete. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions and apply it correctly.

PM_me_your_Jeep: Okay, got it! I'll re-grout the whole shower and apply some additional waterproofing to the corners and basin. And I'll make sure to use a silicone-based sealant for the seams and edges. Thanks for the advice, tjohn2018! You're a lifesaver. I'm glad I could learn from my mistakes and do it right this time.

Just make sure to use the right materials and techniques, and you'll be golden. And hey, if you need any more advice or guidance, I'll be here to help. Keep me posted on your progress and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions.

PM_me_your_Jeep: Will do, tjohn2018! Thanks again for your help and guidance. I'm excited to get back to work on my shower and see it come together. And who knows, maybe one day I'll be a pro tiler like you!

tjohn2018: Ha! You never know, PM_me_your_Jeep! With practice and patience, you can become a master tiler. And hey, even if you don't, you'll still have a beautiful shower to show for it. Keep at it and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. And remember, it's not about being perfect, it's about being willing to learn and improve.

PM_me_your_Jeep: Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks again for your help and advice, tjohn2018.

For me, installing tile on sheetrock is acceptable for kitchen or bathroom backsplashes where there is little to no water exposure.
PM_me_your_Jeep: It’s the purple board Sheetrock. It wasn’t cost as much as experience hanging it.  

Appreciate the heads up though. I’ll definitely keep an eye on the corners and basin. 

For reference this house was built in 1957 and it was regular Sheetrock and tile. Only. And nothing was wet in the wall. So I thought I was going above and beyond with the purple board and red guard.
SkullMan124: Cement board would have been your best bet but you should be fine.  Just make sure to caulk/silicone any gaps.  You can also apply a grout sealer to prevent any moisture from making its way through the grout joints.

I've seen sheetrock/tile showers that lasted well over 30+ years.
abedfilms: Hey what is grout sealer? I have grout that has fine cracks in it, is that what it's for?
RahchachaNY: Grout sealer does nothing for waterproofing. All sealer does is makes it easier to clean the grout. It needs to be reapplied every year or so. Big myth about sealer being used to waterproof the grout.
cptnamr7: Epoxy based grout or GTFO. Discovered it existed on my second tile job and I'll never go back. Of course, have yet to find the good shit at any of the Big Box stores, but amazon is your friend here. Never seal grout, no matter how bad it gets just scrub it clean. Bonus- far easier to install: no more ""wipe 500 times then wipe it again""
RahchachaNY: &gt;Epoxy based grout or GTFO

Got that right. I leave epoxy out because very few DIY's will touch it.  Check out the urethane grouts. Pretty nice.
maartenvanheek: Not an expert but isn't urethane an epoxy, or a component in epoxy compounds?
RahchachaNY: I don't know the makeup of actual epoxy grout. I do know if you get it on your clothes you are tossing them. 😁
Perm-suspended: And your tile sponges...
Duck_Giblets: Those are disposable
Perm-suspended: So are clothes.
Duck_Giblets: Recommended to discard of sponges after use
Perm-suspended: I'm not sure why you'd throw all your sponges away after using them once, but it's your money.
Duck_Giblets: Epoxy ruins them :)

Official instructions for mapei kerapoxy are to discard sponges as they become saturated
Perm-suspended: Yeah, I know the epoxy does, that was the point of my first comment. I thought you were then saying it's recommended to *always* throw them away and was confused why you would waste money like that lol.
Duck_Giblets: Ah I see. A typical job will use 2-3 epoxy sponges. Once it's been used that's it, can't reuse even a partially used sponge
Perm-suspended: I've had a little luck using vinegar, dish soap and warm water immediately after finishing grouting, but then you gotta carry that shit with you too and it becomes easier to toss them.

This allows us to incorporate any available prior information about the distribution of species abundances and to quantify the uncertainty in the estimated value of $n$. We also discuss the implications of our results for the design of efficient sampling strategies for estimating the number of unseen species. For instance, we show that it is generally better to sample from a larger number of sites, rather than from a smaller number of sites with higher abundances. This is because the former approach allows for a more diverse range of species to be sampled, which in turn increases the likelihood of observing unseen species."," a Gibbs-Poisson abundance model in the context of a population with infinitely many species. From this extension, a parameter $\gamma $ naturally appears, which is a measure of richness or diversity of species. We rederive the sampling formulae for a population with infinitely many species, together with the distribution of the number $P_{k}$ of distinct sampled species. We investigate the estimation of $\gamma $ problem from the sample size $k$ and the observed value of $P_{k}$. We then exhibit a large special class of Gibbs-Poisson distributions having the property that sampling from a discrete abundance model may equivalently be viewed as a sampling problem from a random partition of unity, now in the continuum. When $n$ is finite, this partition may be built upon normalizing $% n$ infinitely divisible iid positive random variables by its partial sum.

On top of that, nobody actually knows when jesus was born. Not the day, month, or even year. It is widely suspected that he was born in the spring.

The Roman Emperor Constantine I converted to Christianity in 312 A.D. and sanctioned Christianity. Church leaders then made efforts to appropriate the winter-solstice holidays and thereby achieve a more seamless conversion to Christianity for the emperor’s subjects.

The oldest existing record of a christmas celebration is found in a Roman almanac that tells of a Christ’s Nativity festival led by the church of Rome in 336 A.D.

In the context of population genetics, the Doob-transformation technique can be used to study the behavior of the WF model in the presence of selection, mutation, and genetic drift. By applying the Doob-transformation to the WF model, we can obtain a branching diffusion process that describes the evolution of the gene frequency over time. The branching diffusion process can be used to study the long-term behavior of the gene frequency, including the probability of extinction and the rate of fixation of the gene.

In addition to the WF model, the Doob-transformation technique can be applied to other diffusion processes arising in population genetics, such as the Moran model and the Fleming-Viot model. These models are more complex than the WF model and include additional features such as selection, mutation, and genetic drift. By applying the Doob-transformation technique to these models, we can obtain a deeper understanding of the behavior of the gene frequency over time and the probability of extinction and fixation of the gene.

Overall, the Doob-transformation technique is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of diffusion processes arising in population genetics. By applying this technique to the WF model and other models, we can gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of genetic drift and the probability of extinction and fixation of genes in populations.",") diffusion, either neutral or with mutations. We study a particular Doob transform which is based on the exponential function in the usual fitness parameter sigma. We have in mind that this is an alternative way to introduce selection or fitness in both WF-like diffusions, leading to branching diffusion models ideas. For this Doob-transform model of fitness, the usual selection drift sigma x(1-x) should be superposed to the one of x_{t} to form tilde{x}_{t} which is the process that can branch, binarily. In the first neutral case, there is a trade-off between branching events giving birth to new particles and absorption at the boundaries, killing the particles. Under our assumptions, the branching diffusion process gets eventually globally extinct in finite time with exponential tails. In the second case with mutations, there is a trade-off between killing events removing some particles from the system and reflection at the boundaries where the particles survive. This branching diffusion process also gets eventually globally extinct but in very long finite time with power-law tails. Our approach relies on the spectral expansion of the transition probability kernels of both x_{t} and tilde{x}_{t}."

To achieve this goal, the paper proposes a methodology for automatic theme detection in customer care conversations. The methodology consists of several steps. First, the conversations are preprocessed to remove irrelevant information and to convert the text into a format suitable for analysis. This includes tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. Second, the conversations are analyzed to identify the themes mentioned in each conversation. This is done using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The NLP techniques are used to identify the keywords and phrases that are relevant to each theme, while the machine learning techniques are used to classify the conversations based on the presence or absence of these keywords and phrases. Finally, the results of the analysis are used to generate statistics about the customer problems and to identify the priorities for intervention.

The proposed methodology is evaluated using a dataset of real-life customer care conversations. The results show that the methodology is effective in detecting the themes mentioned in each conversation and in generating accurate statistics about the customer problems. The methodology is also able to identify the priorities for intervention, which is essential for improving user satisfaction. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed methodology in other domains.

In addition to the proposed methodology, the paper also discusses the challenges and limitations of automatic theme detection in customer care conversations. One of the main challenges is the variability of the customer population, which can lead to unpredictable conversation structures. Another challenge is the ambiguity of the language used in the conversations, which can make it difficult to identify the themes mentioned. The paper also discusses the potential solutions to these challenges, such as using machine learning techniques to adapt to the variability of the customer population and using NLP techniques to disambiguate the language used in the conversations.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the automatic analysis of real-life telephone conversations between an agent and a customer of a customer care service. The proposed methodology is effective in detecting the themes mentioned in each conversation and in generating accurate statistics about the customer problems. The paper also discusses the challenges and limitations of automatic theme detection in customer care conversations and provides potential solutions to these challenges."," interleaved with mentions of facts that are irrelevant for the application purpose. Furthermore, in certain conversations theme mentions are localized in specific conversation segments while in other conversations mentions cannot be localized. As a consequence, approaches to feature extraction with and without mention localization are considered. Application domain relevant themes identified by an automatic procedure are expressed by specific sentences whose words are hypothesized by an automatic speech recognition (asr) system. The asr system is error prone. The word error rates can be very high for many reasons. Among them it is worth mentioning unpredictable background noise, speaker accent, and various types of speech disfluencies. As the application task requires the composition of proportions of theme mentions, a sequential decision strategy is introduced in this paper for performing a survey of the large amount of conversations made available in a given time period. The strategy has to sample the conversations to form a survey containing enough data analyzed with high accuracy so that proportions can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. Due to the unpredictable type of theme mentions, it is appropriate to consider methods for theme hypothesization based on global as well as local feature extraction. Two systems based on each type of feature extraction will be considered by the strategy. One of the four methods is novel. It is based on a new definition of density of theme mentions and on the localization of high density zones whose boundaries do not need to be precisely detected. The sequential decision strategy starts by grouping theme hypotheses into sets of different expected accuracy and coverage levels. For those sets for which accuracy can be improved with a consequent increase of coverage a new system with new features is introduced. Its execution is triggered only when specific preconditions are met on the hypotheses generated by the basic four systems. Experimental results are provided on a corpus collected in the call center of the Paris transportation system known as ratp. The results show that surveys with high accuracy and coverage can be composed with the proposed strategy and systems.

But, in my opinion, that's a very weak argument. I mean, think about it, what's the point of having blinds if your pets are just going to ruin them anyway? You'll still have to clean the blinds, and you'll still have to deal with the noise and flapping when the wind blows. And let's be real, pets are not the only consideration when it comes to window treatments. What about aesthetics? Curtains can add a touch of elegance and sophistication to any room, whereas blinds can look cheap and tacky.

And don't even get me started on the functionality of blinds. Sure, they may be better for pets, but they're also much more difficult to use. You have to manually adjust the slats, which can be a real pain, especially if you have multiple windows to cover. And what about blackout curtains? Those are a game-changer for anyone who likes to sleep in or needs to block out light for some other reason. Blinds just can't compete with that.

In conclusion, I think curtains are the clear winner when it comes to window treatments. They're more practical, more aesthetically pleasing, and more functional than blinds could ever hope to be. So, if you're in the market for new window treatments, do yourself a favor and go with curtains. Your pets may not like it, but your eyes (and your sanity) will thank you.

And to all you blind enthusiasts out there, I say, ""Change my view, reddit!"" Show me a compelling reason why blinds are better than curtains, and I'll be happy to reconsider my stance. But until then, curtains all the way, baby!"," area to hold hair, etc. 

Blinds have a much smaller intervention and footprint, particularly if you live in an apartment and intend to get your security deposit back.

Blinds are much better for tight spaces; if the window fits in the space, then so will blinds.

Your vacuum won't suck blinds up into the tube or around the brush.

Blinds offer an easier way to control light; they're like a dimmer for a window. If you only have curtains, then you could have too much direct light when you don't really want it.

Dusting blinds is quicker, easier, and cheaper than demounting curtains and running them through the wash only to remount them. May the gods save you if your curtains are dry-clean only. RIP.

Much easier to clean the inside and outside of your windows with blinds.
-gradmania-: Some very well reasoned points here, I'd say blinds acting as a dimmer is fair, dusting blinds is probably a tad quicker. 

I do have pets though and with the exception of climbing curtains, I've found that it was roughly similar plus they were responsible for breaking a couple.

I'm not so sure I would agree with the window cleaning either, I figure you just kind of shuffle the curtain to the side and it's the same diff? With the exception of curtains that had a slightly longer drop than I wanted, I haven't ever had issues with vacuums either. 

Fair points, but I'm still convinced that blinds need to take a dive.

sad,id1264,human," existing compilers can be a daunting task, requiring significant changes to the compiler's architecture and internals.

However, the benefits of incremental compilation make it an attractive solution for many software projects. By recompiling only the necessary parts of the program, incremental compilation can significantly reduce the time it takes to recompile the entire project. This can be particularly important in projects with large codebases or complex dependencies. Additionally, incremental compilation can also help to reduce the number of errors and bugs that are introduced during the compilation process, as the compiler only needs to recompile the parts of the program that have changed.

One of the main challenges of implementing an incremental compiler is correctly identifying the dependencies between different parts of the program. This requires a deep understanding of the program's structure and dependencies, as well as the ability to efficiently track and manage these dependencies. Another challenge is implementing efficient caching and cache invalidation mechanisms, which are necessary to ensure that the compiler only recompiles the necessary parts of the program.

Despite these challenges, there are several approaches that can be used to implement an incremental compiler. One approach is to use a compiler that is designed specifically for incremental compilation, such as the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) or the Intel C++ Compiler. These compilers are designed to be highly efficient and scalable, and are capable of recompiling large programs quickly and accurately.

Another approach is to use a compiler that is designed for incremental compilation, but is not specifically optimized for it. For example, the LLVM compiler infrastructure is designed to be highly modular and flexible, and can be used to implement an incremental compiler. However, this approach may require significant modifications to the compiler's architecture and internals, which can be time-consuming and challenging.

In conclusion, incremental compilation is an important technique for reducing compilation time and improving the adaptability of software projects. While it can be challenging to implement an incremental compiler, there are several approaches that can be used to achieve this goal. By carefully designing and implementing an incremental compiler, developers can significantly reduce the time it takes to recompile their projects, and improve the overall efficiency and scalability of their software development process."," a compiler is even harder. We address this problem by developing a compiler design approach that reuses parts of an existing non-incremental compiler to lower the cost of building an incremental compiler. It also gives an intuition into compiling difficult-to-incrementalize language features through staging. Approach: We use the compiler design approach presented in this paper to develop an incremental compiler for the Stratego term-rewriting language. This language has a set of features that at first glance look incompatible with incremental compilation. Therefore, we treat Stratego as our critical case to demonstrate the approach on. We show how this approach decomposes the original compiler and has a solution to compile Stratego incrementally. The key idea on which we build our incremental compiler is to internally use an incremental build system to wire together the components we extract from the original compiler. Knowledge: The resulting compiler is already in use as a replacement of the original whole-program compiler. We find that the incremental build system inside the compiler is a crucial component of our approach. This allows a compiler writer to think in multiple steps of compilation, and combine that into a incremental compiler almost effortlessly. Normally, separate compilation \`a la C is facilitated by an external build system, where the programmer is responsible for managing dependencies between files. We reuse an existing sound and optimal incremental build system, and integrate its dependency tracking into the compiler. Grounding: The incremental compiler for Stratego is available as an artefact along with this article. We evaluate it on a large Stratego project to test its performance. The benchmark replays edits to the Stratego project from version control. These benchmarks are part of the artefact, packaged as a virtual machine image for easy reproducibility. Importance: Although we demonstrate our design approach on the Stratego programming language, we also describe it generally throughout this paper. Many currently used programming languages have a compiler that is much slower than necessary. Our design provides an approach to change this, by reusing an existing compiler and making it incremental within a reasonable amount of time."

I've been thinking about using a combination of both gluing and screwing, but I'm not sure if that would be the best approach. I'm also considering using a dado joint to attach the shelves, but I'm not sure if that would be strong enough to hold the weight of the components. I've seen some tutorials online that use a combination of screws and wood glue, but I'm not sure if that would be the best option for this project.

I'm really hoping someone out there has some experience with building a similar project and can offer some advice or guidance. I'd love to hear any suggestions or ideas you may have on how to attach the shelves in a way that is both strong and aesthetically pleasing."," gluing and finish nailing, but wasn't sure the finish nails would be able to support the weight of the game systems and DVR. Any advice is more than welcome, please, and thank you!

EDIT: I also thought of adding [these](http://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-0946998-50-Nickel-Shelf-Pin/dp/B003DCC77Q/ref=lp_517826_1_1?s=hardware&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392850017&amp;sr=1-1) type of pegs or similar to hold the shelves instead.
Buck_20: You have a few different options open to you. It seems you're going in a good direction as you dont want to glue and screw butt joints together. Such a joint would be weak and I wouldn't trust putting expensive electronics on it. It is possible if you predrill the holes, But there are better options. Especially for the long haul.

Shelving pegs would work just fine I believe. Its a simple, fast, and clean looking solution. Be sure to buy some quality pegs built for sturdy applications since you'll be putting valuables on them. From what it sounds like, you were thinking of using finish nails to achieve the same purpose? I would advise against it. Finish nails are designed to add pressure between two surfaces, not bear weight laterally.

And if you have the time and are so inclined, you could dado joint the shelves into place. You would need a circular saw or router, a chisel, and some wood working experience to make it look clean, but it is possible. Thats what I would do, but then again I'm a carpenter. Good luck though, its always satisfying to build something oneself.
Astr0nautikal: Really appreciate the response and help. I think my best option is for the shelving pegs. Any opinion on the one I posted from Amazon? Or have any suggestions of your own? What I meant with the finish nails was to nail them into the sides of the shelves like I would have done with screws. I ruled that option out pretty early on. Again, thanks for your help and advice! I may also use the excess plywood from all the cuts to practice some dado joints, as I've never done them before.

EDIT: If I were to dado the shelves, I would have to make 3/4 wide cuts on the sideboards and how deep would you recommend? 1/4"" or 1/2""?
Buck_20: Try 3/8ths for the dado's if you go that route; maybe a little less. I was taught that a good rule of thumb is no greater than half the width of the material you're cutting into. And sorry I dont really have any opinions on what pegs to purchase, those ones seem like they'll do the trick. And the reviews on it seem fine too.

I've been thinking of a few ways to make sandbags heavier for deadlifts and squats. One idea I had was to fill the sandbags with different materials to increase their weight. For example, you could fill them with small rocks, pebbles, or even metal washers. This would allow you to increase the weight of the sandbag without having to buy a new one. Another idea I had was to use a sandbag with a removable liner, so you could fill it with different materials or weights depending on your workout goals.

Another option I've been considering is to use a sandbag with a handle that allows you to attach additional weight to it. This could be something like a chain or a rope with weights attached to the end. This would give you the ability to add weight to the sandbag as needed, without having to buy a new one.

I've also been looking into using sandbags with different shapes and sizes. For example, a sandbag with a longer handle would allow you to use it for deadlifts and squats, while a sandbag with a shorter handle would be better suited for squats and lunges. This would give you the ability to use the sandbag for different exercises and vary your workout routine.

I've also thought about using sandbags with different materials, such as sand, rice, or even water. This would allow you to change the weight and texture of the sandbag depending on your workout goals. For example, using a sandbag filled with water would give you a different feel and resistance compared to one filled with sand.

Overall, I think there are a few ways to make sandbags heavier for deadlifts and squats, and I'm excited to try out some of these ideas and see how they work for me. I'm hoping that by incorporating sandbags into my workout routine, I'll be able to add some variety and challenge to my exercises, and make progress towards my fitness goals."," fast as possible during the ""noob gainz"" phase. It may be great for starting, but where do I go from there to progress? Do you guys have any creative ideas to maybe load two of the sand bags in one? What type of bag can hold 100+ LBS of sand? Are there any other substitutes for barbells for deadlifts and squats that are cheap?

**TL;DR: Any way to increase weight for sandbags for deadlifts and squats?**
vinca_minor: I've got a couple of cat litter jugs that are just under 3 gallons.  Full of water, they weigh about 22lbs each.   I've managed to get up to 3x8 squatting them, so I've dumped them and am letting them dry before I try putting quickcrete in them and see if that will raise the mass in a useful amount.   The nice thing about them is that they have handles on top.   

I'm pretty certain one will not hold an entire 50lbs bag of quickcrete, though, so I may have a barbell in my future, but considering my ~$100 investment for the last 6 months of exercise, I think that may be fair.   
kadoodledum: Awesome! Concrete hm? Is it heavier than sand per cubic unit though? And do you think it'd work for deadlifts?
klew3: Average unit weight of concrete is 150pcf (lbs/cubic foot) while sands typically are about 120pcf. Source - bachelor's in civil engineering. Sand will be denser if compacted and/or well graded (lots of different grain sizes) which maximizes volume occupied by the material. 

That said concrete is the result of hydrated cement with some sort of aggregate like sand, gravel, etc. The aggregate adds or reduces bulk and weight depending on what you use. Cement is a dry powder that reacts with water to form the binder in concrete. I have no idea off the top of my head what cement weighs. Sorry if somewhat useless for this convo. Quickcrete is I believe a brand of cement, can't remember if it has aggregate in it or not. 

Edit: Quickcrete does have sand and gravel.
kadoodledum: Wow. TIL about concrete and different densities. Cool. But out of practicality, sand would be the best option in a duffel bag? I don't see how concrete can be used in a bag without being awkward to use. 
klew3: Yeah I imagine sand is the best option as it contours to your body and is relatively inexpensive especially if you have decent sand around where you live that's free for the taking.

sad,id1165,human," mappings, which is a fundamental concept in the theory of harmonic mappings, is also introduced.

In this context, we show that the Dirichlet energy is a convex functional and that the set of minimizers is a closed convex set. We also prove that the Dirichlet energy is lower semi-continuous with respect to the weak topology on the space of probability measures. This allows us to establish the existence of minimizers for the Dirichlet energy and to study their properties.

Furthermore, we investigate the behavior of the Dirichlet energy under composition with Lipschitz mappings. We show that the Dirichlet energy is invariant under such compositions, which is a crucial property in the study of harmonic mappings. This result is used to establish the existence of harmonic mappings between compact convex sets, which is a fundamental problem in the theory of harmonic mappings.

In addition, we discuss the relation between the Dirichlet energy and other functionals that have been introduced in the literature, such as the Monge-Ampère energy and the Wasserstein energy. We show that these functionals are closely related to the Dirichlet energy and that they can be used to study the properties of harmonic mappings.

Finally, we provide some examples of harmonic mappings and discuss their applications in various fields, such as image processing, computer vision, and machine learning."," geodesics in the Wasserstein space is recovered by taking for Omega a segment of R. As the Wasserstein space (P(D), W\_2) is positively curved in the sense of Alexandrov we cannot apply the theory of Koorevaar, Schoen and Jost and we use instead arguments based on optimal transport. We manage to get existence of harmonic mappings provided that the boundary values are Lipschitz on d Omega, uniqueness is an open question. If Omega is a segment of R, it is known that a curve valued in the Wasserstein space P(D) can be seen as a superposition of curves valued in D. We show that it is no longer the case in higher dimensions: a generic mapping Omega -> P(D) cannot be represented as the superposition of mappings Omega -> D. We are able to show the validity of a maximum principle: the composition F(mu) of a function F : P(D) -> R convex along generalized geodesics and a harmonic mapping mu : Omega -> P(D) is a subharmonic real-valued function. We also study the special case where we restrict ourselves to a given family of elliptically contoured distributions (a finite-dimensional and geodesically convex submanifold of (P(D), W\_2) which generalizes the case of Gaussian measures) and show that it boils down to harmonic mappings valued in the Riemannian manifold of symmetric matrices endowed with the distance coming from optimal transport."

The \ion{H}{i} disc of NGC~300 is also found to be warped, with a maximum warp angle of about $20^{\circ}$, which is likely a result of the galaxy's interaction with its surroundings. The warp is most pronounced in the outer regions of the disc, where the \ion{H}{i} emission is weaker and more diffuse. This is consistent with the idea that the warp is driven by the tidal forces exerted by the Sculptor group galaxies, which are thought to have played a key role in shaping the structure and evolution of NGC~300.

The high-resolution \ion{H}{i} map of NGC~300 also reveals a number of interesting features, including a faint \ion{H}{i} bridge connecting the galaxy to its nearest companion, NGC~3077. This bridge is thought to be a remnant of a past galaxy interaction, and may have played a key role in the formation of the Sculptor group. Additionally, the map shows a number of \ion{H}{i} shells and filaments, which are likely the result of supernova explosions and other energetic events within the galaxy. These features provide valuable insights into the star formation and evolution of NGC~300, and highlight the importance of \ion{H}{i} mapping in understanding the structure and evolution of galaxies."," of $290^{\circ}$ orientation angle, and an extended outer \ion{H}{i} disc with a major axis of more than $1^{\circ}$ on the sky (equivalent to a diameter of about $35~\mathrm{kpc}$) and a different orientation angle of $332^{\circ}$. A significant fraction (about 43~per cent) of the total detected \ion{H}{i} mass of $1.5 \times 10^{9}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ resides within the extended outer disc. We fitted a tilted ring model to the velocity field of NGC~300 to derive the rotation curve out to a radius of $18.4~\mathrm{kpc}$, almost twice the range of previous rotation curve studies. The rotation curve rises to a maximum velocity of almost $100~\mathrm{km \, s}^{-1}$ and then gently decreases again in the outer disc beyond a radius of about $10~\mathrm{kpc}$. Mass models fitted to the derived rotation curve yield good fits for Burkert and NFW dark matter halo models, whereas pseudo-isothermal halo models and MOND-based models both struggle to cope with the declining rotation curve. We also observe significant asymmetries in the outer \ion{H}{i} disc of NGC~300, in particular near the edge of the disc, which are possibly due to ram pressure stripping of gas by the intergalactic medium (IGM) of the Sculptor group. Our estimates show that ram pressure stripping can occur under reasonable assumptions on the density of the IGM and the relative velocity of NGC~300. The asymmetries in the gas disc suggest a proper motion of NGC~300 toward the south-east. At the same time, our data exclude IGM densities of significantly higher than $10^{-5}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ in the vicinity of NGC~300, as otherwise the outer gas disc would have been stripped."

sad,id1017,human," the planet's gravitational influence can explain the observed belt morphology.

Our analysis shows that the planet's orbit is indeed highly eccentric, with a semi-major axis of approximately 140 au and an eccentricity of around 0.6. This high eccentricity leads to a significant variation in the planet's distance from the star over its orbital period, which in turn affects the strength of its gravitational influence on the dust ring. We find that the planet's gravitational force can indeed perturb the dust ring, causing it to become more irregular and dynamically unstable.

Furthermore, our simulations suggest that the planet's orbit may be influenced by the presence of other, as-yet-undetected planets in the system. The gravitational interactions between these planets and Fom b could lead to a complex dance of orbital perturbations, which in turn affect the dust ring's morphology. This highlights the need for further observations and simulations to fully understand the dynamics of the Fomalhaut system and the role of Fom b in shaping the dust ring.

In conclusion, our analysis provides a more detailed understanding of the orbital dynamics of Fom b and its interaction with the dust ring. The results suggest that the planet's highly eccentric orbit plays a crucial role in shaping the belt's morphology, and that further studies are needed to fully elucidate the complex dynamics of this fascinating system."," the proposed disk sculpting scenario by Fom b is plausible. We used a dedicated MCMC code to derive the statistical distributions of the orbital elements of Fom b. Then we used symplectic N-body integration to investigate the dynamics of the dust belt, as perturbed by a single planet. Different attempts were made assuming different masses for Fom b. We also performed a semi-analytical study to explain our results. Our results are in good agreement with others regarding the orbit of Fom b. We find that the orbit is highly eccentric, is close to apsidally aligned with the belt, and has a moderate mutual inclination relative to the belt plane of. If coplanar, this orbit crosses the disk. Our dynamical study then reveals that the observed planet could sculpt a transient belt configuration with a similar eccentricity to what is observed, but it would not be simultaneously apsidally aligned with the planet. This transient configuration only occurs a short time after the planet is placed on such an orbit (assuming an initially circular disk), a time that is inversely proportional to the planet's mass, and that is in any case much less than the 440 Myr age of the star. We constrain how long the observed dust belt could have survived with Fom b on its current orbit, as a function of its possible mass. This analysis leads us to conclude that Fom b is likely to have low mass, that it is unlikely to be responsible for the sculpting of the belt, and that it supports the hypothesis of a more massive, less eccentric planet companion Fom c."

Next, I removed the handle by unscrewing the retaining nut that holds it in place. This gave me access to the stem and the O-ring that seals the faucet. I gently pulled out the stem and removed the O-ring, taking note of its position and orientation so I could replace it correctly later.

With the handle removed, I could now focus on disconnecting the steel pipe from the faucet fixture. I used a wrench to loosen the nut that holds the pipe in place, and then carefully pulled the pipe off the fixture. This exposed the threads on the fixture, which would need to be cleaned and prepared for the new faucet.

I took a moment to inspect the threads and make sure they were free of any debris or mineral buildup. A quick clean with a cloth and some gentle scrubbing with a toothbrush did the trick. Now I was ready to install the new faucet.

I threaded the new faucet onto the fixture, making sure it was securely seated and tightened evenly. I then reconnected the steel pipe to the faucet, making sure it was snug but not overtightened. Finally, I replaced the handle and reattached the O-ring, making sure it was properly seated and aligned.

With the new faucet installed, I turned the water supply back on and checked for any leaks. Satisfied that everything was working properly, I gave my neighbor a call to let him know the job was done. He was thrilled and grateful for my help, and I was happy to have been able to assist him. It was a small act of kindness, but it made a big difference in his life."," limited budget :(

Rawme9: Shut water lines off, disconnect EVERYTHING you can see. They should all be screwed on hand tight, but being so old you may need pliers or a sink tool. Don't forget the nuts underneath holding the deck plate on (the silver base of the faucet)

Once everything is disconnected, the faucet and deck plate and attached lines should just pull out. Don't force it, sometimes the lines take a little finagling to get through the hole. 

Buy a new sink kit (3 hole sink kit by the looks of it), can be found for 60-ish bucks on the cheap end. To install, you should be able to essentially slide the whole faucet fixture into the pre existing holes, screw on the nuts, attach the water lines and be done. It will of course come with instructions as well!

Scooter_127: Let me tell ya, unless you can easily get your hands up in there, get a sink/faucet tool that they mentioned.  They're like $10-15 and worth their weight in gold.  Without one you may end up ""doing yoga"" to get your hands around the nuts holding the faucet in.

I have to agree with AndurielsShadow on this one. The whole process of using the shell to separate the yolk just seems like an unnecessary step. And don't even get me started on the mess it can make. I mean, have you ever tried to pass a shell back and forth between people without accidentally cracking it or getting egg all over the place? It's a recipe for disaster.

Not to mention, the shell method is just so... primitive. I mean, we're living in the 21st century here, and we still can't figure out a better way to separate eggs? It's like we're still stuck in the dark ages or something.

And don't even get me started on the whole ""cultured human being"" thing. I mean, just because someone uses the shell method doesn't mean they're not cultured. I've met plenty of cultured people who use the shell method, and I've met plenty of uncultured people who use the pouring method. It's not like there's some kind of direct correlation between the two.

But hey, to each their own, right? If you want to use the shell method, that's your prerogative. Just don't expect me to join you. I'll stick to my pouring method, thank you very much.

AndurielsShadow: I'm glad we could have this conversation. It's always good to clear the air and get people's opinions out there. And who knows, maybe one day we'll find a better way to separate eggs. A guy can dream, right?

LowKeyWalrus: Yeah, maybe. But until then, I'll just stick to using the shell. It may not be the most efficient method, but at least it's a little more... civilized.

AndurielsShadow: Civilized? You're kidding, right? The shell method is the most primitive way to separate eggs. It's like we're still living in the stone ages or something.

LowKeyWalrus: Hey, don't knock it till you try it, my friend. The shell method may not be the most efficient, but at least it's a little more... human.

AndurielsShadow: Human? You're kidding, right? The shell method is the most inhumane way to separate eggs. It's like we're still living in the dark ages or something.

LowKeyWalrus: Hey, don't be so quick to judge. The shell method may not be the most efficient, but at least it's a little more... traditional.

AndurielsShadow: Traditional? You're kidding, right? The shell method is the most untraditional way to separate eggs. It's like we're still living in the stone ages or something.

LowKeyWalrus: Hey, don't be so quick to judge. The shell method may not be the most efficient, but at least it's a little more... fun.

AndurielsShadow: Fun? You're kidding, right? The shell method is the most boring way to separate eggs. It's like we're still living in the dark ages or something.

LowKeyWalrus: Hey, don't be so quick to judge. The shell method may not be the most efficient, but at least it's a little more... interesting.

AndurielsShadow: Interesting? You're kidding, right? The shell method is the most uninteresting way to separate eggs. It's like we're still living in the stone ages or something.

And so the debate continues. Will we ever find a better way to separate eggs? Only time will tell. But for now, we'll just have to agree to disagree.",". Just crack the egg in your hand and strain it. It's simple, it's quick, and is the most effective method to separate a yoke every time. I understand if you're the type of person that doesn't like to touch raw ingredients. If that's the case go the slower route. But if you dont mind touching raw ingredients, then the garlic thing gives you absolutely no benefits.
FlRELYNX: You shouldn’t use the hand method if you need to use the egg whites for baking, like in merengue, as you can’t have any fat contents in your bowl when mixing them. Your hands contain natural oils acting just like fat. Also I don’t get how it would take any longer than sifting it by hand. It takes me about 5 seconds to use the shell method and I don’t waste as much egg whites. A lot of the egg white liquid will stick to my hands but it doesn’t stick to the insides of the shells, as they‘re coated in that wet membrane.
harriettbakes: Sorry, that is not correct. I am a baker and use the hand method as much as possible. I can get much more of the egg white separated from the yolk using my hands vs. any other method, and the resultant egg whites never fail to whip up fluffy and light. 

The egg shell method is more likely to stab the yolk as you are separating. Yolk in the egg whites is what limits successful whipping. Maybe your hands weren’t entirely clean from a different step and there were oils left over on your hand.
FlRELYNX: I never touch any raw ingredients when whipping up whites and I always clean my bowls with vinegar, if I need to. I also always wash my hands with soap after each step. I’ve learned this trick from a SORTEDfood video and in my experience, it has proven to be true. The yolk shouldn’t be stabbed by the shells if you do it correctly (do not shove one shell into the other but rather hold them slightly under each other). It‘s important that you break them correctly though, so that the shells don’t crack too much. That’s a matter of practice - of course this will be the same with all methods. I have never had any shells in my dough/ merengue etc. but I‘ve had problems with them not whipping correctly, which I didn’t have after switching to this method. So maybe you were just lucky with your merengue or because of your experience in handling the whipping. My mother doesn’t clean her bowls as thoroughly as I do (she doesn’t really like baking because of the effort) and she doesn’t really bother separating them correctly (i.e. once she accidentally had a tiny bit of yolk in there) but she still always manages to whip her whites up beautifully. So I guess it also depends on the quality of your eggs and on your whipping method. Nevertheless, the science says any oils in your whites will make it harder to whip them! And I‘m not really good at whipping, so I definitely prefer my method, just to be safe.
harriettbakes: Wow, more power to you! To each his own. Happy whipping.
FlRELYNX: Thanks, happy whipping to you, too!

The GPR data collected during the survey provided valuable insights into the internal structure and dynamics of the glacier. The radar signals were able to penetrate the ice and provide information on the layering and stratigraphy of the glacier, including the presence of glacial erratics and moraines. The data also revealed the presence of subglacial lakes and rivers, which play a crucial role in the glacier's hydrological cycle. The survey results showed that the glacier is experiencing significant changes in its thickness and extent, with some areas showing signs of rapid thinning and others showing signs of thickening.

Further analysis of the GPR data revealed the presence of a number of interesting features, including a large ice cave system located beneath the glacier's surface. The cave system was found to be several kilometers long and was thought to be the result of meltwater flowing through the ice and creating a network of tunnels and caverns. The survey also revealed the presence of a number of glacial lakes, which are thought to be the result of the glacier's melting and calving.

The Austre Lov\'enbreen glacier is an important site for scientific research, and the data collected during the survey will be used to improve our understanding of the glacier's dynamics and response to climate change. The survey results will also be used to inform the development of models that can predict the glacier's future behavior and help to predict the impact of climate change on the glacier and its surrounding environment."," closest to the slopes. The GPR was coupled to a GPS system to position traces. Each profile has been manually edited using standard GPR data processing including migration, to pick the reflection arrival time from the ice-bedrock interface. Snow cover was evaluated through 42 snow drilling measurements regularly spaced to cover all the glacier. These data were acquired at the time of the GPR survey and subsequently spatially interpolated using ordinary kriging. Using a snow velocity of 0.22 m/ns, the snow thickness was converted to electromagnetic wave travel-times and subtracted from the picked travel-times to the ice-bedrock interface. The resulting travel-times were converted to ice thickness using a velocity of 0.17 m/ns. The velocity uncertainty is discussed from a common mid-point profile analysis. A total of 67542 georeferenced data points with GPR-derived ice thicknesses, in addition to a glacier boundary line derived from satellite images taken during summer, were interpolated over the entire glacier surface using kriging with a 10 m grid size. Some uncertainty analysis were carried on and we calculated an averaged ice thickness of 76 m and a maximum depth of 164 m with a relative error of 11.9%. The volume of the glacier is derived as 0.3487$\pm$0.041 km3. Finally a 10-m grid map of the bedrock topography was derived by subtracting the ice thicknesses from a dual-frequency GPS-derived digital elevation model of the surface.

In this context, the focus is on exploring the properties of SLRs that enable them to effectively support the development and deployment of language processing systems. This includes investigating the relationships between the language-typed artifacts and the language-typed functions or relations that operate on them, as well as the impact of these relationships on the overall behavior and performance of the SLR. Additionally, the research aims to identify and address the challenges and limitations of building and testing SLRs, particularly in terms of scalability, maintainability, and usability.

One of the key challenges in building SLRs is ensuring that the language-typed artifacts and functions or relations are properly aligned and integrated, so that the repository can effectively support the development and deployment of language processing systems. This requires a deep understanding of the relationships between the different components of the SLR, as well as the ability to design and implement effective interfaces and APIs that enable seamless interaction between them.

Another important aspect of this research is the development of testing and validation strategies for SLRs, which are critical for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the language processing systems that are built on top of them. This includes developing and evaluating various testing and validation techniques, such as simulation-based testing, model-based testing, and formal verification, as well as exploring the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to improve the effectiveness of testing and validation.

In this case, the developer must carefully consider the structure of the input text to ensure that the island parser can accurately identify the islands and ignore the water. This can be a challenging task, especially when dealing with complex or ambiguous input. For example, consider a programming language that uses indentation to denote block-level structure, but also allows for comments and whitespace to be included in the code. In this case, the developer must define the grammar rules to distinguish between the indentation used for block-level structure and the indentation used for formatting purposes.

Another challenge that developers may face when implementing an island parser is handling exceptions and errors. Since the parser is designed to ignore the water, it may not be able to detect errors in the input text that occur outside of the islands. This can make it difficult to identify and diagnose errors in the code, especially if the errors are caused by incorrect or missing syntax.

Despite these challenges, island parsers can be a powerful tool for software engineering. By allowing developers to focus on the programming constructs of interest, they can simplify the parsing process and reduce the complexity of the grammar rules. This can make it easier to develop and maintain parsers, and can also enable the creation of more efficient and effective parsing algorithms. In addition, island parsers can be used in a variety of applications, including code analysis, code generation, and code transformation."," the total number of grammar rules. When describing the grammar rules for such water, the developer must consider other rules and enumerate a set of symbols, which we call alternative symbols. Due to this difficulty, island parsing seems to be not widely used today despite its usefulness in many applications. Approach: This paper proposes the lake symbols for addressing this difficulty in developing an island parser. It also presents an extension to PEG for supporting the lake symbols. The lake symbols automate the enumeration of the alternative symbols for the water inside an island. The paper proposes an algorithm for translating the extended PEG to the normal PEG, which can be given to an existing parser generator based on PEG. Knowledge: The user can use lake symbols to define water without specifying each alternative symbol. Our algorithms can calculate all alternative symbols for a lake symbol, based on where the lake symbol is used in the grammar. Grounding: We implemented a parser generator accepting our extended PEG and implemented 36 island parsers for Java and 20 island parsers for Python. Our experiments show that the lake symbols reduce 42 % of grammar rules for Java and 89 % of rules for Python on average, excluding the case where islands are expressions. Importance: This work eases the use of island parsing. Lake symbols enable the user to define the water inside the island simpler than before. Defining water inside the island is essential to apply island parsing for practical programming languages."

As the debate around police reform continues to rage on, it's clear that the status quo is no longer acceptable. The disproportionate number of police-involved shootings and the lack of accountability have led to widespread mistrust and anger in communities across the country. It's time for a new approach, one that prioritizes the safety and well-being of both officers and the public.

One potential solution is to adopt a more nuanced approach to police training, one that emphasizes de-escalation techniques and crisis intervention. This could involve partnering with mental health professionals and community organizations to provide officers with the skills and knowledge they need to effectively respond to complex situations.

Another key area for reform is the way police departments handle officer-involved shootings. Currently, many departments have a culture of silence and cover-ups, where officers are often reluctant to speak out against their colleagues or report incidents of excessive force. This needs to change, with departments implementing policies that encourage transparency and accountability.

In addition, there needs to be a greater emphasis on community policing and building relationships between officers and the public. This could involve initiatives such as community outreach programs, youth mentorship, and cultural sensitivity training. By fostering stronger connections between police and the communities they serve, officers can build trust and credibility, reducing the likelihood of conflicts and improving overall public safety.

Renegade_Meister: These are very interesting propositions that I'd like to play Devil's Advocate for:

1) I agree that officers in shootings  have been through trauma and stress and should not be asked to do it again. I can't speak to data about officers in multiple shootings, but I'd think we'd hear more from the media about individuals and general stats on this. The challenge with the proposition are the possible loop holes. Want to retire early? Shoot someone who you can claim looked like was pulling a gun on you. Are you a gang who needs a cop of the street? Put then in a situation requiring force. Maybe the benefits would out weigh misuses, maybe not.

2) Being more like the UK with possibly less gun related crime would be nice, but there's more than one personal firearm per American citizen in the US. To try reaching that ideal, a number of things would need to happen, such as people would need to be disarmed before you could think of disarming US cops. This also grows the arms black market. Bearing arms is a constitutional right, one that would not be given up without a civil war.
cavehobbit: 1) so far as media reports, I can only say I have seen that kind of analysis posted on reddit,  on a phone now so find it is difficult. So far as retiring early, you get nothing if you are convicted of a crime, so that is incentive to be careful. I do not know how the UK handles vulnerability of their officers to attack, but it seems to work there.

2) I do not think you would need to disarm the population for this to work. If anything the resulting imbalance of power between the people and authority would increase and abuse would worsen. The attempt would indeed lead to a civil war, imo.
Renegade_Meister: &gt;1) So far as retiring early, you get nothing if you are convicted of a crime, so that is incentive to be careful.

I doubt that officers fraudulently trying to retire in the way I described would be dumb enough to leave a trail of evidence. Even if they're caught, conviction is a challenge, as this doesn't address the potential bias of prosecuting DAs (attorneys).

&gt;2) I do not think you would need to disarm the population for this to work. If anything the resulting imbalance of power between the people and authority would increase and abuse would worsen. The attempt would indeed lead to a civil war, imo.

This approach is particularly useful in situations where the available information is incomplete, inconsistent, or uncertain.

The application of possibility theory in this context has several advantages. Firstly, it allows for the representation of uncertainty in a more nuanced and flexible way, taking into account the complexities of human language and cognition. Secondly, it enables the modeling of the subjective nature of human decision-making, acknowledging that individuals may have different perspectives and interpretations of the same information. Finally, possibility theory provides a framework for analyzing and predicting the behavior of complex systems, such as decision-making processes, under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity.

In the context of Experiment 1, the findings suggest that the use of verbal categories for grades of uncertainty is a more effective way of processing knowledge about uncertainty than numerical processing. This is because verbal categories allow for a more flexible and nuanced representation of uncertainty, taking into account the complexities of human language and cognition. The 'elastic' constraints of possibility theory enable the modeling of this process, allowing for a more accurate representation of human decision-making processes under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity.", on the verbal expressions for every sing1e subject are determined in Experiment 2 by means of sequential calibration. In further experiments it is shown that the superiority of the verbal processing of knowledge about uncertainty guise generally reduces persistent biases reported in the literature: conservatism (Experiment 3) and neg1igence of regression (Experiment 4).

Forecasting is structurally related to the estimation of probabilities for rare events insofar as supporting and contradicting arguments have to be evaluated and the choice of the final Judgment has to be Justified according to the evidence brought forward. In order to assist people in such choice situations a formal model for the interactive checking of arguments has been developed.

This is particularly significant for the interpretation of the NIR emission, which is often dominated by the [SIII]9062+9531 line. The improved predictions for CIII] and CIV also highlight the potential for using these lines as diagnostic tools for studying the NLR of Seyfert 2 galaxies.

The success of our multi-component photoionization models in fitting the emission line spectra of Seyfert 2 galaxies suggests that local density inhomogeneities play a crucial role in shaping the observed line intensities. This is consistent with the idea that the NLR is a complex, multi-phase medium, with different regions exhibiting different physical conditions. The ability of our models to reproduce the observed line intensities, including the elusive NIR features and high-ionization lines, provides strong evidence for this scenario.

Furthermore, our results have important implications for the interpretation of the emission line spectra of Seyfert 2 galaxies in general. The ability to accurately model the NIR emission, and the improved predictions for CIII] and CIV, provide new tools for studying the NLR of these galaxies. This is particularly significant for understanding the role of the NLR in regulating the activity of the central engine, and for constraining models of AGN feedback."," problem'), and assess the usability of some emission-line ratios as indicators of the ionization parameter. We find that a systematic variation of the cloud column densities in a population of matter-bounded clouds is inconsistent with the trends and correlations exhibited by the emission lines in the diagnostic diagrams. Concerning the temperature problem, the only possibility that leads to an overall consistency with the strengths of all other observed emission lines is subsolar metal abundances (as compared to e.g. the presence of dust, the existence of a high-density component, or matter-bounded clouds). In addition, the consequences of the presence of (Galactic-ISM-like) dust internal to the clouds were investigated. These models alleviate the [OIII]-ratio problem but did not lead to overall consistent fits. In our final model series, the NLR is composed of a mixture of metal-depleted (0.5 x solar) clouds with a radius-independent range in densities (10^2 to 10^5 cm^-3) distributed over a range of distances from the nucleus (galactocentric radii from at least $\sim$ 10^{20} cm to 10^{21.5} cm, for $Q_{tot} = 10^{54}$ s^{-1}). In order to encompass the observed range of each line intensity relative to H$\beta$, it turns out to be necessary to vary the spectral energy distribution incident on the clouds, qualitatively confirming the findings of Ho et al. (1993). We found a successful continuum sequence by adding an increasing contribution of a hot black body ($T \approx 200000$ K) to a steep powerlaw ($\alpha_{uv-x} \approx -2$).

He was particularly critical of the Conservative Party, which he saw as being out of touch with the needs and aspirations of the working class. Davies was also a strong advocate for the rights of women, and was one of the first politicians to campaign for women's suffrage.

In 1914, Davies joined the Liberal Party and was elected as the Member of Parliament for the University of Wales constituency. He quickly established himself as a vocal and passionate advocate for social justice and reform, and was particularly concerned with issues related to poverty, education, and healthcare. Davies was also a strong supporter of the Labour Party, and worked closely with Labour leaders such as Keir Hardie and Ramsay MacDonald to promote progressive policies.

During World War I, Davies was a fierce critic of the war effort, and was one of the few politicians to speak out against the conflict. He believed that the war was a product of imperialism and nationalism, and that it was being waged for the benefit of the wealthy and powerful at the expense of the working class. Davies's pacifist views put him at odds with many of his colleagues, and he was eventually forced to resign from the Liberal Party in 1918.

Despite his resignation from the Liberal Party, Davies remained committed to his pacifist ideals and continued to campaign for social justice and reform. In the 1920s, he became involved with the Labour Party, and was a key figure in the formation of the party's pacifist wing. Davies was also a strong supporter of the League of Nations, and worked closely with other international organizations to promote peace and disarmament.

In the 1930s, Davies became increasingly disillusioned with the Labour Party, which he believed had become too closely tied to the interests of the wealthy and powerful. He eventually left the party and founded the Pacifist League, which aimed to promote peace and disarmament through non-violent means.

A military service tribunal in 1916 allowed him conscientious objector exemption, conditional on Work of National Importance mediated through the Friends Ambulance Unit General Service section. He first worked in a FoR home for disturbed children, trying to put into practice his belief in the goodness of human nature. Then he went to work on sheep farms in the hills of Llyn. However, he began regularly to preach pacifism in the market place, so his exemption was withdrawn. This meant he was sent a notice to report for military training; when he ignored that he was arrested by the civil police and taken before the magistrates, who handed him over to the military.

After the war he worked for a time at Gregynog, for the Misses Davies.
In 1923, Davies was elected Member of Parliament for the University of Wales constituency, as an Independent Christian Pacifist, but after the election took the Labour whip, although he never joined any political party. He was thus the only university MP to ever sit on the Labour benches. In 1924, standing again as an Independent Christian Pacifist candidate, he lost the seat to the Liberal Ernest Evans. Thereafter Davies became a Calvinistic Methodist (Presbyterian) minister, serving as pastor in Tywyn and Maethlon between 1926 and 1930. He left to take up work among the unemployed in Rhosllannerchrugog and Brynmawr, and then settled in the Quaker community at Maes-yr-Haf in the Rhondda Valley.  In 1939 he became President of the pacifist organisation, Heddychwyr Cymru, closely associated with the Peace Pledge Union, of which he served as Chair 1946–1949.
In 1946, Davies settled in North Wales at Dolwyddelan, and he continued to preach outdoors despite deteriorating health. He suffered from depression throughout his life, and in 1949 he committed suicide in North Wales Mental Hospital, Denbigh. He was buried at Dolwyddelan.
Davies married on 5 February 1916, at Finchley, London, Leslie Eleanor Royde-Smith, sister of author Naomi Royde-Smith. The couple had a daughter, Jane Hedd.

I've heard that splitting can help with recovery and allow for more focused work on specific muscle groups, but I'm also worried that it might lead to plateaus or even regression in some areas.

Has anyone else out there had experience with splitting their routine? Do you have any tips or advice on how to do it effectively? Should I stick with my current routine or try something new?

I've been considering adding some upper body exercises to my routine, such as push-ups, pull-ups, or rows. I've also been thinking about incorporating some cardio exercises, like burpees or jump squats, to help with fat loss and overall fitness.

But before I make any changes, I want to hear from you all. What do you think? Should I stick with my current routine or try something new?"," - still learning the balance)
* inverted rows, 3x5 (not quite parallel to ground yet and stalled here for 2 weeks)
* chin ups, 3x5 (need about 20 lbs assist and stalled here for 2 weeks)

I've corrected for other issues like bad sleep or diet, and everything else is progressing steadily, so I don't know why my pulling movements aren't improving.

Would splitting my upper body work be a good idea? Perhaps alter acting push movements and pull movements each workout, or alternating horizontal plane and vertical plane?
jakehildreth: Pulling is much harder than all the other movements.  I was stuck on CC Pullup Step 2 for literally 6 months.  Just keep improving your form and/or adding reps slowly.  Slow progress is still progress.

It may be worth it to try doing your rows with bent knees working up to 3x8-10 before going back to straight legs.   Or stick with the straight legs, but raise the height of the row, work up to 3x8-10, then lower it just a bit.  Same thing with chins: give yourself more assistance until you reach 3x8-10, and then lower back down to 20 lbs. assist.  

One step backwards is okay if it allows you to take two steps forward.

Other options to help break your plateau: keep everything the same, but add a couple more sets to both pulling motions.  You aren't getting quite enough volume to really force adaptation.  Or try padding your set with slow negatives.  If you are only able to do 5 full-motion reps, add on 3 negatives at the end of each set.

BTW: for pistols, don't add band-assisting on only one side.  Do your weak side first until you fail.  Then do your strong side and stop when you reach the number of reps you were able to do on your weak side.  That is, if you can only do 2 reps on your left, don't do any more than 2 reps on your right side.  This will help you balance your strength. 

If you'd really want to stick with band-assist, be sure to band assist on the right too, but still don't exceed the reps performed on the left.
porkburp: Thanks for your help here! Sounds like you may have gone through the same issue as me. How are you doing with them now.

I'm due for a workout later today; I'm going to try adding 2 more sets and will likely have to add a bit more assistance to complete all of them. We'll see how that goes for the next 2 weeks and hopefully I can break that plateau.

As for pistols, I'm doing band-assisted on both sides to keep it even, but only require for the left side at present. And I'm very close to evening that imbalance out.
jakehildreth: My best for bar pull-ups was ~~3x8~~ 9,8,7,4 ~~back sometime in June or July~~ on August 1st before I really started bulking up.  (Getting fat makes pull-ups HARD!)

On Monday, I did 6,6,6,5,4 ring pull-ups.  Was aiming for 5x6 but couldn't quite keep it up for the whole session.  I normally shoot for 3 sets, but like you, I wasn't getting enough volume because I could only pull 4 or so reps at once.  You (generally) want a total of &gt;20 reps every session, even if that means adding more sets.

sad,id1250,human," pairs can play a crucial role in the formation of quarkonia in the plasma.

The recombination process is thought to occur through the interaction between the heavy quark and antiquark pairs with the plasma constituents, such as gluons and quarks. The plasma acts as a medium that facilitates the recombination process, allowing the heavy quark and antiquark pairs to form bound states. This process is often referred to as ""recombination"" or ""re-formation"" of quarkonia. The recombination process is expected to be sensitive to the properties of the plasma, such as its temperature, density, and composition.

Recent studies have shown that the recombination process is an important mechanism for the formation of quarkonia in heavy ion collisions. The recombination process is expected to be more pronounced at lower energies, where the plasma is denser and the recombination time is longer. In addition, the recombination process is expected to be sensitive to the properties of the quarkonia, such as their mass and spin.

The study of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions has provided valuable insights into the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. The observed suppression of quarkonium production at high energies, followed by a significant increase at lower energies, is consistent with the idea that the quark-gluon plasma acts as a medium that facilitates the recombination of heavy quark and antiquark pairs. The study of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions has also provided a new probe of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma, which can be used to study the properties of the plasma in a wide range of temperatures and densities.

In addition, the study of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions has also provided insights into the properties of the quarkonia themselves. The observed suppression of quarkonium production at high energies, followed by a significant increase at lower energies, is consistent with the idea that the quarkonia are sensitive to the properties of the plasma. The study of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions has also provided a new probe of the properties of the quarkonia, which can be used to study the properties of the quarkonia in a wide range of temperatures and densities.

Furthermore, the study of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions has also provided insights into the properties of the quark-gluon plasma at the early stages of the collision. The observed suppression of quarkonium production at high energies, followed by a significant increase at lower energies, is consistent with the idea that the quark-gluon plasma is formed at the early stages of the collision. The study of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions has also provided a new probe of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma at the early stages of the collision, which can be used to study the properties of the plasma in a wide range of temperatures and densities.

In conclusion, the study of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions has provided valuable insights into the properties of the quark-gluon plasma and the quarkonia themselves. The observed suppression of quarkonium production at high energies, followed by a significant increase at lower energies, is consistent with the idea that the quark-gluon plasma acts as a medium that facilitates the recombination of heavy quark and antiquark pairs.

Thus, phenomenological studies have to account for static screening, dissociation and recombination in a consistent way. But recombination is less understood theoretically than the melting and dissociation. Many studies using semi-classical transport equations model the recombination effect from the consideration of detailed balance at thermal equilibrium. However, these studies cannot explain how the system of quarkonium reaches equilibrium and estimate the time scale of the thermalization. Recently, another approach based on the open quantum system formalism started being used. In this framework, one solves a quantum evolution for in-medium quarkonium. Dissociation and recombination are accounted for consistently. However, the connection between the semi-classical transport equation and the quantum evolution is not clear. In this dissertation, I will try to address the issues raised above. As a warm-up project, I will first study a similar problem: $\alpha$-$\alpha$ scattering at the $^8$Be resonance inside an $e^-e^+\gamma$ plasma. By applying pionless effective field theory and thermal field theory, I will show how the plasma screening effect modifies the $^8$Be resonance energy and width. I will discuss the need to use the open quantum system formalism when studying the time evolution of a system embedded inside a plasma. Then I will use effective field theory of QCD and the open quantum system formalism to derive a Lindblad equation for bound and unbound heavy quark antiquark pairs inside a weakly-coupled QGP. Under the Markovian approximation and the assumption of weak coupling between the system and the environment, the Lindblad equation will be shown to turn to a Boltzmann transport equation if a Wigner transform is applied to the open system density matrix. These assumptions will be justified by using the separation of scales, which is assumed in the construction of effective field theory. I will show the scattering amplitudes that contribute to the collision terms in the Boltzmann equation are gauge invariant and infrared safe. By coupling the transport equation of quarkonium with those of open heavy flavors and solving them using Monte Carlo simulations, I will demonstrate how the system of bound and unbound heavy quark antiquark pairs reaches detailed balance and equilibrium inside the QGP. Phenomenologically, my calculations can describe the experimental data on bottomonium production. Finally I will extend the framework to study the in-medium evolution of heavy diquarks and estimate the production rate of the doubly charmed baryon $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ in heavy ion collisions."

sad,id1623,human,"'t necessarily mean the strongest, but the one who is most adapted to their environment is the strongest. That's a fair point. But doesn't that definition of strength also imply that the strongest is the one who is most resilient? The one who can withstand the most challenges and still thrive?

Palm_Tree_Island: That's a good point, but I think we're getting a bit too caught up in semantics here. The concept of ""survival of the fittest"" is meant to describe the process of natural selection, not to define what strength is. And in that context, it's clear that the fittest organism is the one that is best adapted to its environment, regardless of whether that means being strong, fast, or camouflaged.

peelen: But doesn't that definition of strength also imply that the strongest is the one who is most efficient? The one who can use their resources most effectively to survive and thrive? For example, a cheetah may be able to run fast, but a hyena may be able to scavenge and survive just as well, if not better, than the cheetah.

Palm_Tree_Island: That's a great point, and it gets to the heart of what I think is the most important aspect of the concept of ""survival of the fittest"". It's not just about being the strongest or the fastest, it's about being the most efficient and effective at surviving and thriving in your environment. And that can take many different forms, depending on the organism and its circumstances.

peelen: Exactly! And I think that's what's so fascinating about the concept of ""survival of the fittest"". It's not just a simple matter of who is the strongest, it's a complex and multifaceted process that involves many different factors and adaptations. And it's what has allowed life on Earth to thrive and diversify in so many different ways.

Palm_Tree_Island: Absolutely. And I think it's also important to remember that the concept of ""survival of the fittest"" is not just limited to the natural world. It can also be applied to human society and culture. For example, in a business or economic sense, the ""fittest"" company or individual may be the one that is most adaptable and able to thrive in a changing environment.

peelen: That's a great point, and it's something that I think is often overlooked in discussions of the concept of ""survival of the fittest"". But it's a crucial aspect of understanding how the concept applies to human society and culture. And it's what makes the concept so relevant and important for us to consider in our daily lives.

Palm_Tree_Island: Exactly. And I think that's what's so powerful about the concept of ""survival of the fittest"". It's a reminder that we are all part of a larger ecosystem, and that our survival and success is dependent on our ability to adapt and thrive in that ecosystem. And it's a reminder that we should always be striving to be the best version of ourselves, whether that means being the strongest, the fastest, or the most efficient.","'t mean fastest but ""stronger on speed"" and ""stronger"" would be ""stronger on the strength""? Looks like if we are talking about opinions it rather your opinion what words mean.
Palm_Tree_Island: No, fastest would mean that individuals strength is speed and thus equips them to be the fittest of their species. Just like you say “the chameleon’s strength is it’s camouflage.” Here’s a definition for you since you wanna suggest that my use of strength is an opinion lol. 

Strength (Noun) : a good or beneficial quality or attribute of a person or thing.

So yes, survival of the fittest does in fact mean survival of the strongest, being strongest has nothing to do with physical ability to lift something.
peelen: &gt;survival of the fittest does in fact mean survival of the strongest, being strongest has nothing to do with physical ability to lift something.

And explain me how does it means something different than what I wrote?

I mean your and mine sentence mean ""not only physical strength"" yet mine is opinion, and yours is fact.
Palm_Tree_Island: Again read the definition for strength.

Strength (Noun) : a good or beneficial quality or attribute of a person or thing.

By this definition, survival of the fittest is the same as survival of the strongest. They are the same thing.
peelen: Again how does ""fastest"" doesn't mean  a good or beneficial quality of being fast?
Palm_Tree_Island: Your initial post is that survival of the fittest is not always survival of the strongest. We both agree that being the fastest also makes that individual the strongest. By this logic you have just stated that the fastest is the strongest, thus survival of the fittest is survival of the strongest.
peelen: And we both understood that in this statement “strongest” means physical strength, and we both “understood” overall message of it. 

I might agree that it was worded poorly, but that doesn’t make it “opinion”.
Palm_Tree_Island: No, strongest does not mean physical strength. This is what I am saying. Strongest has nothing to do with physical strength. Cooperative learning can be a strength. This is where you are wrong
peelen: So if word it like that:  


""YSK that surviving of the fittest does not mean surviving of the physically strongest""  


That would stopped being ""opinion""?
Palm_Tree_Island: No
peelen: Ok

sad,id1728,human," more you learn, the more you'll realize that evolution is not just a theory, but a fundamental aspect of our understanding of the natural world. From the simplest bacteria to the most complex organisms, evolution has shaped the diversity of life on Earth. And yet, despite the overwhelming evidence, there are still those who deny its existence.

But for those who are willing to look, the evidence is everywhere. In the fossil record, where transitional forms and gradual changes in species can be seen. In the comparative anatomy of different organisms, where similar structures and functions can be found. In the genetic code, where the same DNA sequences can be found in different species. And in the natural world itself, where the struggle for survival and the adaptation to environment are the driving forces behind the evolution of life.

So, celshaug, I hope you take the time to read and learn about evolution. It's not just a theory, it's a fact. And once you understand it, you'll see the world in a whole new light.

Be sure to read the entire notification, as it will likely provide information on what you can do to protect yourself.
* **Change your passwords**: Immediately change the passwords for all accounts that may have been compromised. Use strong, unique passwords for each account, and avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.
* **Enable two-factor authentication**: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts. It requires you to provide a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone or a biometric scan, in addition to your password. This makes it much harder for hackers to gain access to your accounts.
* **Monitor your accounts**: Keep a close eye on your accounts and monitor them for any suspicious activity. Check your account activity regularly and report any suspicious activity to the relevant authorities.
* **Consider a credit monitoring service**: If your personal data, such as your name, address, and social security number, was compromised, consider signing up for a credit monitoring service. These services will monitor your credit reports and alert you to any suspicious activity.
* **Be cautious with emails and links**: Be cautious when opening emails and links, especially if they are from unknown senders. Hackers may try to trick you into revealing your login credentials or installing malware on your device.
* **Keep your software up to date**: Make sure your operating system, browser, and other software are up to date with the latest security patches. This will help protect your device from vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.
* **Use a reputable antivirus program**: Use a reputable antivirus program to protect your device from malware and other types of malicious software.

Any change in this pattern, it says, will adversely affect the livelihood of millions of farmers in the state. The pre Independence agreement was based on the area occupied by Mysuru Kingdom and Madras presidency. The areas of South Canara (previously under Madras presidency), Coorg Province which was later merged with Karnataka have not been accounted to calculate the right of Karnataka's water share. Although the River Kaveri originated in the Coorg Province, the Coorg province was not included in the agreement. This raises a question about the validity of bilateral agreements between Mysore and Madras presidencies.
Decades of negotiations between the parties bore no fruit until the Government of India constituted a tribunal in 1990 to look into the matter. After hearing arguments of all the parties involved for the next 16 years, the tribunal delivered its final verdict on 5 February 2007. In its verdict, the tribunal allocated 419 TMC  (11.9 km3) of water annually to Tamil Nadu and 270 TMC (7.6 km3) to Karnataka; 30 TMC  (0.85 km3) of Kaveri river water to Kerala and 7 TMC  (0.2 km3) to Puducherry. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu being the major shareholders, Karnataka was ordered to release 192 TMC (5.4 km3) of water to Tamil Nadu in a normal year from June to May.
The dispute, however, did not end there, as all four states decided to file review petitions seeking clarifications and possible renegotiation of the order.

The first agreement on sharing Kaveri river water dates back to 1892, between Madras Presidency and princely state of Mysuru."

The company also worked on a $93 million contract for the border wall in California, which involved the construction of 11 miles of fencing and barriers.

In addition to its work on the Trump wall, SLSCO has also been involved in other large-scale infrastructure projects, including the construction of roads, bridges, and airports. The company has also provided services for the U.S. military, including the construction of military bases and the installation of communication systems.

SLSCO's work on government projects has been marked by controversy, with some critics accusing the company of profiteering from disaster relief efforts and others questioning the company's environmental and social impact. Despite these criticisms, SLSCO remains one of the largest and most successful construction companies in the United States, with a portfolio of projects that spans the country and a reputation for delivering complex infrastructure projects on time and on budget.

As the company continues to grow and expand its operations, it is likely to remain a major player in the U.S. construction industry, with a focus on delivering high-quality projects that meet the needs of its clients and the communities it serves.

I'm also planning to install grab bars in strategic locations, such as near the toilet, shower, and bathtub, to provide support and balance for my girlfriend. Additionally, I'll make sure to install a lowered sink and toilet to make it easier for her to use them independently. I've also considered installing a shower seat or bench, which would allow her to sit down while showering and reduce the risk of falling.

Another important aspect to consider is the lighting in the bathroom. I plan to install motion-sensitive lights and/or LED lights with high color contrast to make it easier for my girlfriend to navigate the space. I'll also make sure to install a non-slip floor and a shower mat to prevent slipping and falling.

In terms of the toilet, I'm thinking of installing a toilet with a raised seat and a grab bar behind it, which would make it easier for my girlfriend to use the toilet independently. I'll also consider installing a toilet paper holder that's within easy reach, as well as a toilet brush holder that's designed for people with limited mobility.

Overall, my plan is to create a bathroom that's not only wheelchair accessible but also safe and comfortable for my girlfriend. I'm hoping to find a home that already has some of these features in place, but if not, I'm willing to make the necessary modifications to ensure that she can live comfortably and independently."," likely have to settle for a smaller shower area, say 30""x45"" and the person showering her stands outside of the shower. We'd replace a tub with a similar shower pan and membrane setup. We could have the curtain lowered to about hip level for the person standing and use lower water pressure to prevent water from splashing too crazy. If the floor is not tiled already, then I'd do so to make the area waterproof and have tiled trim around the floor. 

Does this seem like a decent plan or am I overlooking something? I do realize ADA compliance standards require 30""x60"" as the minimum, but home buying at this time is already difficult and  we should be fine with 30""x45"" if the aide stands outside the shower area.

Thanks for the help.
choate51: Setup looks reasonable. Have you possibly considered turning the bathroom into a wet room instead of just the shower area? 

 I've converted a bathroom into a wet room so there was more room for my SO when she needs it for her bad days (MS) and is something I wanted to mention since you already are doing tile.
saturnineoranje: Actually that does sound ideal about a wet room, but given my limited experience I'm kind of nervous about it if I were to do a curbless shower
dominus_aranearum: Look into doing Wedi products for rebuilding a shower or creating a wet room. Their products are waterproof and have an insurance backed warranty that exceeds all others. It is easy to install provided you follow the instructions.

I would not use the existing tile as you've no way to know how adequate the current waterproofing is. Tile and grout themselves are not waterproof.
saturnineoranje: Cool, I'll check em out! Thank you
elizzup: Seconding (Thirding?) advice on converting it to a wet room. I know a lot of folks are talking about needing a tub for resale value, but a good wet room will be more advantageous than a bathtub you'll never use.   

Don't stress about resale. You're the one living in the house, and things are tough enough with a quadriplegic partner as it is. Make sure that the space suits your needs now. A wet room, when done well, will be a huge selling point for plenty of folks.

Sometimes I feel like I'm just pretending to be normal, like I'm putting on a show for everyone else. It's exhausting and it makes me feel like I'm living a lie. I wish I could just be myself, without having to worry about what others think of me.

I've tried to talk to my therapist about this, but she just tells me to practice relaxation techniques and to focus on my strengths. She says that I'm doing the best I can and that I should be proud of myself. But it's hard to feel proud when I'm just going through the motions and not really living in the moment.

I've also tried to talk to my friends about this, but they just tell me to ""be myself"" and ""stop worrying about what others think."" But it's hard to be myself when I'm not even sure who that is. I feel like I'm just a collection of scripts and rehearsed lines, rather than a real person with thoughts and feelings.

I'm not sure what the solution is, but I know that I need to find a way to break free from this cycle of pretending and start living in the moment. I need to find a way to be myself, without fear of judgment or rejection. It's a scary thought, but I know that it's the only way to truly be happy.

As I sit here, thinking about this, I'm realizing that I'm not alone in this struggle. There are probably others out there who feel the same way, who are just pretending to be normal and struggling to find their true selves.

Since you start off not knowing much vocabulary it forces you to get comfortable with small talk and conversational stuff. “Where are you from? My favorite book is x. Do you like to cook?” Etc. Even if you’re just practicing the stuff out of the textbook, it’s helping you exercise the skill of simply talking to people.

I was thinking of using a 3mm thick acrylic or MDF for the trays, so I'll definitely consider bolting them together with fender washers. Recessing the bolt heads and washers is a great idea, it would not only add extra support but also make the trays look cleaner. I'll make sure to keep the bolt holes small enough so that the keyboard and mouse trays can still be easily removed and reattached.

Another thing I'm worried about is the pivot/hinge mechanism. I don't want it to be too loose, but at the same time, I don't want it to be too stiff either. I'm thinking of using a small piece of metal or a plastic rod to create the pivot point, and then attaching it to the keyboard tray with some kind of bracket or clamp. This way, the mouse tray would be able to move smoothly and freely, but still stay in place when not in use.

I've also been thinking about adding some kind of cable management system to the trays. Since I'll be using them for my keyboard and mouse, I'll need to find a way to route the cables and keep them organized. Maybe I could attach some small cable ties or clips to the trays, or even add some kind of cable management channel or groove to the design. This would not only keep the cables tidy, but also make it easier to move the trays around.

Overall, I'm feeling a bit more confident about my DIY project now.

I may have to look into that idea, seems it'd be much better.

How would I go about doing this? I'd need slides that attach to the bottom of the keyboard tray and then to the side of the mouse tray, which doesn't seem to be how they work?
theuautumnwind: This is hideous, done in paint, but I'm @ work and sort of rushing.

This is a side view with the mousepad tray in the closed position. I'm imagining that you could sandwich two pieces of plywood to make the keyboard tray double the thickness on the left side and mount the slides to that. T

Your routine seems to be well-rounded and focused on your specific goals. However, I would suggest a few changes to optimize your workout and make it more efficient.

Firstly, you may want to consider adding more variety to your exercises. For example, you could replace the Beginner Shrimp Squats with some other leg exercises like lunges or calf raises. This will help to target different muscle groups and prevent plateaus.

Secondly, you may want to increase the intensity of your workouts by adding more weight or resistance. For example, you could wear a weighted vest or use resistance bands to make your exercises more challenging.

Thirdly, you may want to consider adding some exercises that target your core muscles. This will help to improve your overall stability and strength, which is important for handstand push-ups.

Here's an example of how you could modify your routine:

On Days (every 2nd day):

* Warm-Up w. Wrist Warm-Up (10min)
* 4x3 Chin-Ups (Building strength for Pull-Ups)
* 3x4 Lunges
* 3x8 Decline Pike Push-Ups
* 3x8 Flat Straight Leg Raises
* 3x15s Fingertip Planks (Weak wrists, building strength for Fingertip Push-Ups)
* 3x30s Arched Hold
* 3x45s Reverse Plank Bridge
* 3x30s Hollow Body Hold
* Some Grip Exercises
* 3x60s Weighed Plank
* 10s [Yaad Lean](http://antranik.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/yaad-lean.jpg)
* Cool-Down (6-7min)

* Several Frogstand Attempts
* 10s Yaad Lean

n3ox1ne: Your routine looks good for your goals of strong back, arms and HSPU. But why stop there ? Is time a constraint ?

You can strengthen pretty much the whole body if you add in progressions for horizontal push(PPPUs) and pull (Tuck lever rows) to your current routine which already has vertical push, pull and legs. You might have to split up the days into push/pull days like in the recommend routine or into verical/horizontal days (my current routine) with rest days inbetween. 

A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Train everything so that there are no weak links. The choice is upto you though :)
ihatepepperballs: Back and forearms/wrists are my biggest weakness right now, so that's what I'm focusing on.

By the way: how could I split this into two parts? I would like to do the first half in the morning, then the second one in the afternoon.

Thanks for the input :)
n3ox1ne: Its a 2 day split. For example, Monday would be horizontal day with pushups/rows/core. Tuesday would be rest day and Wednesday would be vertical day with pullups/dips(will move to hspu after getting good stable handstands)/legs. Thursday would be rest and Friday would be horizontal again and it just repeats like that every day, rest, train, rest.

This is my personal routine modified from the recommend one. It makes sense to me and works for me. It might be different for you. Stick to the recommend routine for 2 or 3 months atleast and then make changes if needed. Good luck and enjoy this journey :D
ihatepepperballs: I feel like that's too much rest time, especially for a teenager. I want action, dammit :D

Are you sure it would be more beneficial to split it into two days when I could do the whole thing in one?
n3ox1ne: Your recovery time will have to increase especially after progressing to the intermediate movements. The tendons and joints will need more rest between sessions. Otherwise you will overtrain the body and get injured. Remember this is not a race. Take it slow and stay injury free. This is all my opinion though. To praphrase Phi ""Stick to the goddamn recommend routine"" xD
ihatepepperballs: I always feel so lazy on rest days.

Oh well, I guess it must be so then.

Also, I love that you used an emoticon after every reply.

Stylolites are formed through a complex interplay of mechanical and chemical processes, involving the interaction of rocks with fluids and the deformation of the Earth's crust. The formation of stylolites is often linked to the presence of fluids, which can be responsible for the dissolution of minerals and the creation of voids. The dissolution of minerals can lead to the formation of stylolites, which can then act as conduits for the flow of fluids and the transport of dissolved material. The deformation of the Earth's crust can also play a role in the formation of stylolites, as it can create the necessary conditions for the growth of these geo-patterns.

The study of stylolites has important implications for our understanding of geological processes. By analyzing the geometrical and compositional characteristics of stylolites, researchers can gain insights into the tectonic evolution of a region and the processes that have shaped the Earth's crust. Stylolites can also provide valuable information about the conditions under which rocks were formed and the fluids that were present during their formation. This information can be used to reconstruct the geological history of a region and to better understand the processes that have shaped the Earth's surface.

In addition to their importance in understanding geological processes, stylolites can also be used as indicators of the tectonic evolution of a region. By analyzing the distribution and characteristics of stylolites in a given area, researchers can gain insights into the tectonic events that have occurred in that region. For example, the presence of stylolites in a particular rock unit can indicate that the rocks were subjected to significant tectonic stress, which can be used to reconstruct the geological history of the region.

The study of stylolites is a rapidly evolving field, with new techniques and methods being developed to analyze and interpret these geo-patterns. The use of advanced imaging techniques, such as X-ray computed tomography and electron microscopy, has allowed researchers to gain a better understanding of the internal structure and composition of stylolites. The development of new analytical methods, such as geochemical analysis and stable isotope analysis, has also provided valuable insights into the formation and evolution of stylolites.

In conclusion, stylolites are an important aspect of the Earth's crust, playing a key role in the dissolution of rocks, the transport of dissolved material, and the precipitation in surrounding pores. The study of stylolites has important implications for our understanding of geological processes and the tectonic evolution of a region. By analyzing the geometrical and compositional characteristics of stylolites, researchers can gain valuable insights into the conditions under which rocks were formed and the fluids that were present during their formation. The study of stylolites is a rapidly evolving field, with new techniques and methods being developed to analyze and interpret these geo-patterns."," form? How can they be used to measure strain and formation stress? How do they control fluid flow in the upper crust? Geometrically, stylolites have fractal roughness, with fractal geometrical properties exhibiting typically three scaling regimes: a self-affine scaling with Hurst exponent 1.1+/-0.1 at small scale (up to tens or hundreds of microns), another one with Hurst exponent around 0.5 to 0.6 at intermediate scale (up to millimeters or centimeters), and in the case of sedimentary stylolites, a flat scaling at large scale. More complicated anisotropic scaling (scaling laws depending of the direction of the profile considered) is found in the case of tectonic stylolites. We report models based on first principles from physical chemistry and statistical physics, including a mechanical component for the free-energy associated with stress concentrations, and a precise tracking of the influence of grain-scale heterogeneities and disorder on the resulting (micro)structures. Experimental efforts to reproduce stylolites in the laboratory are also reviewed. We show that although micrometer-size stylolite teeth are obtained in laboratory experiments, teeth deforming numerous grains have not yet been obtained experimentally, which is understandable given the very long formation time of such geometries. Finally, the applications of stylolites as strain and stress markers, to determine paleostress magnitude are reviewed. We show that the scalings in stylolite heights and the crossover scale between these scalings can be used to determine the stress magnitude (its scalar value) perpendicular to the stylolite surface during the stylolite formation, and that the stress anisotropy in the stylolite plane can be determined for the case of tectonic stylolites. We also show that the crossover between medium (millimetric) scales and large (pluricentimetric) scales, in the case of sedimentary stylolites, provides a good marker for the total amount of dissolution, which is still valid even when the largest teeth start to dissolve -- which leads to the loss of information, since the total deformation is not anymore recorded in a single marker structure. We discuss the impact of the stylolites on the evolution of the transport properties of the hosting rock, and show that they promote a permeability increase parallel to the stylolites, whereas their effect on the permeability transverse to the stylolite can be negligible, or may reduce the permeability, depending on the development of the stylolite. Highlights: Stylolite formation depends on rock composition and structure, stress and fluids. Stylolite geometry, fractal and self-affine properties, network structure, are investigated. The experiments and physics-based numerical models for their formation are reviewed. Stylolites can be used as markers of strain, paleostress orientation and magnitude. Stylolites impact transport properties, as function of maturity and flow direction."

As the girl's letter to Santa spread like wildfire, the community rallied around her and her family. The elementary school where she attended classes was flooded with blankets, toys, and other gifts. The outpouring of support was overwhelming, and the girl's family was grateful for the kindness of strangers.

Meanwhile, Loedkane's post had gone viral, sparking a national conversation about poverty, disability, and the struggles faced by many Americans. The comments section was filled with people sharing their own stories of hardship and offering words of encouragement. Some shared their own experiences with food insecurity, while others offered advice on how to make ends meet on a limited budget.

As Loedkane continued to respond to comments, she began to feel a sense of community and connection with others who understood her struggles. She realized that she wasn't alone, and that there were many people out there who cared and wanted to help.

The government's response to Loedkane's post was swift and decisive. Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services reached out to her, offering assistance and support. They explained that the system was in place to help people like her, and that there were resources available to make ends meet.

Loedkane was skeptical at first, but as she began to work with the government officials, she realized that they were genuinely committed to helping her and others like her. She was connected with a case worker who helped her navigate the system and access the resources she needed.

As the weeks went by, Loedkane's life began to change for the better. She was able to access more food and other essentials, and she was able to pay her bills on time. She was no longer struggling to make ends meet, and she was finally able to feel a sense of hope and optimism.

The girl's letter to Santa had sparked a chain reaction of kindness and generosity, and Loedkane's post had sparked a national conversation about poverty and disability. As the two stories intertwined, they showed that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope and always a way to make a difference.

The elementary school where the girl attended classes continued to receive donations, and the community continued to rally around her and her family. The girl's letter to Santa had brought people together, and it had shown that even the smallest acts of kindness can have a profound impact.

As for Loedkane, she continued to share her story and offer words of encouragement to others who were struggling. She had found a sense of purpose and meaning in her struggles, and she was determined to make a difference in the world.

sad,id945,human,", the study of frescos is a natural extension of the classical theory of Brieskorn modules, which is closely related to the study of the geometry of algebraic varieties.

In particular, the theory of frescos provides a powerful tool for the study of the geometry of algebraic curves and surfaces, and has applications in many areas of mathematics and physics, such as algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and theoretical physics. The study of frescos is also closely related to the study of the geometry of algebraic curves and surfaces, and has applications in many areas of mathematics and physics, such as algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and theoretical physics.

The main goal of this paper is to introduce the notion of fresco and to study its properties and applications in the context of algebraic geometry and theoretical physics. We will also discuss some of the main results and techniques used in the study of frescos, and provide some examples and applications of the theory.",") each choice of a vanishing cycle in the spectral eigenspace of the monodromy for the eigenvalue \ $exp(2i\pi.\lambda)$ \ produces a \ $[\lambda]-$primitive theme, which is a quotient of the fresco associated to the given relative de Rham class itself. The first part of this paper shows that, for any \ $[\lambda]-$primitive fresco there exists an unique Jordan-H{\""o}lder sequence (called the principal J-H. sequence) with corresponding quotients giving the opposite of the roots of the Bernstein polynomial in a non decreasing order. Then we introduce and study the semi-simple part of a given fresco and we characterize the semi-simplicity of a fresco by the fact for any given order of the roots of its Bernstein polynomial we may find a J-H. sequence making them appear with this order. Then, using the parameter associated to a rank \ 2 \ \ $[\lambda]-$primitive theme, we introduce inductiveley a numerical invariant, that we call the \ $\alpha-$invariant, which depends polynomially on the isomorphism class of a fresco (in a sens which has to be defined) and which allows to give an inductive way to produce a sub-quotient rank \ 2 \ theme of a given \ $[\lambda]-$primitive fresco assuming non semi-simplicity. In the last section we prove a general existence result which naturally associate a fresco to any relative de Rham cohomology class of a proper holomorphic function of a complex manifold onto a disc. This is, of course, the motivation for the study of frescos."

The test cell, designed and built specifically for this purpose, allowed for the precise control of various parameters such as temperature, humidity, and air flow rates, enabling a thorough evaluation of the CODYRUN model's accuracy. The results obtained from the simulation were then compared with the actual measurements taken in the test cell, providing a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance. The comparison revealed a high degree of consistency between the simulated and measured data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the CODYRUN model in predicting indoor lighting conditions.

The successful validation of the CODYRUN model has significant implications for the design and optimization of buildings, particularly in regions with high temperatures and humidity levels. By accurately simulating indoor lighting conditions, architects and engineers can create more energy-efficient and comfortable buildings, which is essential for improving the overall well-being of occupants. Furthermore, the model can be used to investigate the impact of various design parameters, such as window size and orientation, on indoor lighting conditions, allowing for more informed design decisions.

The CODYRUN model's ability to accurately simulate indoor lighting conditions also has implications for the development of sustainable and energy-efficient buildings. By optimizing lighting design, buildings can reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprint, contributing to a more sustainable future. The model can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of various lighting technologies, such as LEDs and smart lighting systems, in reducing energy consumption and improving indoor lighting conditions.

In conclusion, the CODYRUN model has been successfully validated using a dedicated test cell in Reunion Island, demonstrating its accuracy in predicting indoor lighting conditions. The model's ability to simulate natural and artificial lighting, combined with its high degree of accuracy, makes it a valuable tool for architects, engineers, and researchers seeking to design and optimize buildings for improved energy efficiency and occupant comfort. As the demand for sustainable and energy-efficient buildings continues to grow, the CODYRUN model is poised to play a critical role in the development of innovative and environmentally friendly building designs."," in low-energy buildings. Introduction Several software packages are available for thermal and airflow simulation in buildings. The most frequently used are ENERGY+ [1], ESP-r [2], and TRNSYS [3]. These applications allow an increasing number of models to be integrated, such as airflow, pollutant transport, and daylighting. In the latter category, we may note ENERGY+, ESP-r and ECOTECT [4] software. After more than 20 years of developing a specific code named CODYRUN, we decided to add a lighting module to our software. This paper therefore provides some details on this evolution and elements of validation. The CODYRUN initial software and its validation Developed by the Physics and Mathematical Engineering Laboratory for Energy and Environment at the University of Reunion Island, CODYRUN [5-14] is a multi-zone software program integrating ventilation and moisture transport transfer in buildings. The software employs a zone approach based on nodal analysis and resolves a coupled system describing thermal and airflow phenomena. Numerous validation tests of the CODYRUN code were successfully applied to the software. Apart from the daylighting model, the majority applied the BESTEST procedure [15]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) sponsors a number of programs to improve the use and associated technologies of energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed BESTEST, which is a method based on comparative testing of building simulation programs, on the IEA's behalf. The procedure consists of a series of test cases buildings that are designed to isolate individual aspects of building energy and test the extremes of a program. As the modelling approach is very different between codes, the test cases are specified so that input equivalency can be defined thus allowing the different cases to be modelled by most of codes. The basis for comparison is a range of results from a number of programs considered to be a state-of-art in United States and Europe. Associated with other specific comparisons, a very confident level of validation was obtained for the CODYRUN initial software [8]."

It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and vulnerable after sharing your thoughts and feelings with your friends. While it's great that you're being honest and open, it can be scary to feel like you're exposing yourself too much. It's natural to want to maintain some level of control over how much others know about you.

One thing you might consider is setting boundaries with your friends. You don't have to share everything with them, and it's okay to keep some things to yourself. You can still be open and honest with them without revealing too much. It's all about finding a balance between being authentic and being mindful of your own comfort level.

Another thing to keep in mind is that your friends are likely to be understanding and supportive. They care about you and want to be there for you, even if they don't always understand everything. Try to remember that they're not judging you, and that they're there to help you through tough times.

It's also important to remember that you don't have to be in the moment all the time. It's okay to take a step back and recharge when you need to. You can still be present and mindful without constantly sharing your deepest thoughts and feelings with others.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to listen to your own intuition and do what feels right for you. If you're feeling overwhelmed or uncomfortable, it's okay to take a step back and reevaluate your relationships. Remember that you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect, and that you don't have to sacrifice your own comfort level to be a good friend.

As you navigate this new level of openness with your friends, try to be gentle with yourself and remember that it's okay to make mistakes. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. Keep in mind that you're not defined by your relationships or your ability to be open, and that you're still the same person you were before you shared your thoughts and feelings with others."," it like that it is to accept it, I want to try.

Maybe they don't have any advice and can't relate to the situation, but they're being cognizant of what you've been through. My advice is to get out of your own head (easier said than done, I know) andbe happy that you felt comfortable enough with themto talk about difficult experiences you've had. I'll bet pretty soon they'll stop tiptoeing and things will be back to normal, they're  just trying to be gentle with you now.

You took a great first step and I'm willing to bet your friends will be comfortable coming to you with their problems, and vice versa.

ThisMoment77: Thank you for this, Im sure vulerability is important and I'll really be there for them. Just the thought of all the good things that come with it motivates me to keep my head up and as you say, be there. Thank you for your comment, it gives me hope and drive to keep going, nice and easy. The idea that everything is possible at the end of the day is mind blowing.

I also saw a coworker to their apartment after an incident that shook them the night beforehand (the coworker actually talked badly about me afterwards which I wasn’t happy about)

Im genuinely exhausted of trying to make new friends should I just give up at this point?

StrongWarmSweet: That’s probably it. Unfortunately depression repels people… which only contributes to depression, obviously. That’s probably why they are telling you to smile too. 

I am also depressed. Don’t give up. Try just saying whatever comes to your head when you are around people (as long as it is polite). You may eventually find your people.
AquaticUndercover: No they tell me to smile as a way of rejecting me. It’s not obvious I’m depressed
StrongWarmSweet: How do you know that?
AquaticUndercover: Just common sense
StrongWarmSweet: Hmmm. I have never heard of that one tbh. I would take it as genuine feedback.
AquaticUndercover: If they wanted to invite me out then they would’ve right there instead of redirecting me
StrongWarmSweet: Well yeah but I mean they may be rejecting you because they perceive you to be depressed. Unfortunately that can happen, which creates more depression. It can be a vicious cycle.
AquaticUndercover: Maybe you are right but if I’m depressed then surely the logical thing to do would be to make sure I’m ok like inviting me out or smth idk. Even if I force a smile and I’m more welcoming I don’t feel like it makes me any closer to people usually they just feel like it’s easier to ask me for favors :/
StrongWarmSweet: Yeah I agree. People can be awful like that. I tend to have the same experience tbh. I have friends but not many and I tend to run into a lot of entitled people too. It is depressing. 

Have you tried meetups?
AquaticUndercover: I’ve sort of seen the app is it good?
StrongWarmSweet: I have just a few friends. Two from back in high school that I see once or twice a year. One from uni I see monthly. One I met in a church group I see once or twice a year. Another I met on meetup that I see monthly. I am also in a relationship with someone I met in uni. But I recommend finding a few buddies before looking for a relationship because that’s easier. 

So yeah my go-to for myself is school, church and meet up apparently. Don’t worry if the one-on-one hangouts are infrequent because over the years it ends up meaning something. 

Meet up is good because you can enjoy a hobby at the same time. And you can go multiple times a week for group hangouts.

Without using optional RGB information, and with a maximum of 37 descriptors, we obtain classification accuracies between 91 % for complex multi-class tasks and 98 % for lower-level processing using models trained on less than 2000 samples per class. Comparisons with classical point cloud classification methods show that 3DMASC features have a significantly improved descriptive power. Our contributions are made available through a plugin in the CloudCompare software, allowing non-specialist users to create classifiers for any type of 3D data characterized by 1 or 2 point clouds (airborne or terrestrial lidar, structure from motion), and two labelled topo-bathymetric lidar datasets, available on https://opentopography.org/."

As you explore these links, you'll notice that each country has its own unique process for soliciting public input. In the United States, for instance, the federal government uses the regulations.gov platform to gather comments on proposed regulations. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the government publishes open consultations on its website, allowing citizens to provide feedback on proposed policies.

In Canada, the government has established a dedicated website for public consultations, where citizens can weigh in on a wide range of issues, from environmental policies to healthcare reform. Australia's government also has a dedicated platform for public consultations, which allows citizens to provide feedback on proposed regulations and policies.

New Zealand, meanwhile, takes a more holistic approach to public engagement, with a focus on building a more participatory democracy. The country's government has established a number of initiatives aimed at increasing citizen participation in the policy-making process, including online consultations and town hall meetings.

But why is public comment so important? For one, it allows citizens to have a direct say in the policies that affect their lives. By providing feedback on proposed regulations, citizens can help shape the direction of their government and ensure that policies are fair and effective.

Public comment also provides an important check on government power, ensuring that elected officials are accountable to the people they serve. By providing a platform for citizens to express their opinions, public comment helps to hold government officials accountable and ensures that they are responsive to the needs and concerns of their constituents.

In addition to these benefits, public comment also provides an opportunity for citizens to engage with the policy-making process in a meaningful way. By providing feedback on proposed regulations, citizens can learn more about the issues that affect their communities and develop a deeper understanding of the policy-making process.

Of course, public comment is not a panacea for all of the challenges facing modern democracies. There are many other factors that contribute to the health and vitality of a democracy, from the quality of the electoral process to the independence of the judiciary.

But by providing a platform for citizens to engage with the policy-making process, public comment can play an important role in strengthening democracy and ensuring that government is accountable to the people. So the next time you're thinking about how to shape your government, remember that public comment is an important tool that can help you make your voice heard.","-your-say/), [Norway](https://www.regjeringen.no/en/find-document/consultations/id1763/),

These connections between exchangeable laws and combinatorial structures have far-reaching implications for the study of random graphs and hypergraphs, as they provide a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of these systems at large scales. For instance, exchangeable laws have been used to analyze the asymptotic behavior of random graph processes, such as the random graph process introduced by Erdős and Rényi [22], and to study the properties of random graph limits, such as the graphon [35].

Furthermore, the study of exchangeable laws has also been motivated by applications in other areas, such as statistical physics and machine learning. For example, exchangeable laws have been used to model the behavior of physical systems, such as spin glasses and other disordered systems, and to analyze the properties of machine learning algorithms, such as the behavior of neural networks."," Szegedy [52], Borgs, Chayes, Lov\'{a}sz, S\'{o}s, Szegedy and Vesztergombi [17], Elek and Szegedy [24] and Razborov [54,55]. However, the connection between these works and the earlier probabilistic structural results seems to have gone largely unappreciated. In this survey we recall the basic results of the theory of exchangeable laws, and then explain the probabilistic versions of various interesting questions from graph and hypergraph theory that their connection motivates (particularly extremal questions on the testability of properties for graphs and hypergraphs). We also locate the notions of exchangeability of interest to us in the context of other classes of probability measures subject to various symmetries, in particular contrasting the methods employed to analyze exchangeable laws with related structural results in ergodic theory, particular the Furstenberg-Zimmer structure theorem for probability-preserving $\mathbb {Z}$-systems, which underpins Furstenberg's ergodic-theoretic proof of Szemer\'{e}di's Theorem. The forthcoming paper [10]--hereditarytest will make a much more elaborate appeal to the link between exchangeable laws and dense (directed) hypergraphs to establish various results in property testing."

For example, in a clinical trial, the null hypothesis might be that a new treatment has no effect on patient outcomes. A Bayes factor can be used to quantify the evidence in favor of this null hypothesis, taking into account the prior probability of the null hypothesis being true. This approach can provide a more nuanced understanding of the evidence than traditional null hypothesis significance testing, which often relies on arbitrary significance levels and ignores the prior probability of the null hypothesis.

Furthermore, the Bayes factor can be used to update the prior probability of the null hypothesis based on the new data, allowing for a more dynamic and adaptive approach to hypothesis testing. This can be particularly useful in situations where the null hypothesis is not a fixed entity, but rather a working hypothesis that may need to be revised as new evidence emerges. By incorporating the Bayes factor into the analysis, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the evidence and make more informed decisions about the validity of the null hypothesis."," than only allowing the null to be rejected or not rejected.
Although conceptually simple, the computation of the Bayes factor can be challenging depending on the complexity of the model and the hypotheses. Since closed-form expressions of the marginal likelihood are generally not available, numerical approximations based on MCMC samples have been suggested. For certain special cases, simplified algebraic expressions can be derived; for instance, the Savage–Dickey density ratio in the case of a precise (equality constrained) hypothesis against an unrestricted alternative. Another approximation, derived by applying Laplace's approximation to the integrated likelihoods, is known as the Bayesian information criterion (BIC); in large data sets the Bayes factor will approach the BIC as the influence of the priors wanes. In small data sets, priors generally matter and must not be improper since the Bayes factor will be undefined if either of the two integrals in its ratio is not finite.

I've tried various exercises to improve my core power, but I've found that the exercises in the RR program are the most effective. I've seen significant improvements in my climbing and bouldering, and I feel more confident and powerful when I'm on the wall. The exercises are challenging, but they're also fun and engaging, which keeps me motivated to continue.

One of the things I like most about the RR program is that it's not just about doing a bunch of exercises and hoping for the best. The program is designed to be progressive, which means that it gets harder as you get stronger. This forces me to adapt and improve, which is a great way to build explosive core power.

Another thing I appreciate about the RR program is that it's not just about building core strength. It's also about building power and speed. The exercises are designed to be explosive, which means that they help me build the ability to generate force quickly. This is essential for climbing and bouldering, where every second counts.

In addition to the exercises themselves, I also appreciate the community and support that comes with the RR program. The forum is a great place to connect with other climbers and boulders, share tips and advice, and get motivated and inspired. It's also a great place to learn from others and get feedback on my progress.

Overall, I'm really happy with the RR program and the progress I've made with it. I've seen significant improvements in my climbing and bouldering, and I feel more confident and powerful when I'm on the wall.

It's extra hard for me b/c I am semi-tall (6'1""), which means that on sit starts I am very scrunched up and have lots of legs and body in the way or hanging off the rock as I explode upward.

Few gym problems are designed to train this kind of move, but they're super common outdoors. (Or when they exist, they just aren't nearly as difficult and awkward as what I encounter outdoors.)

Do any of you have ideas for exercises that will help build *explosive* core power? Currently I do the RR about 3x/wk but do the bodyline drills daily. I think that training the front lever could help me a bit, but since it's not an explosive movement it can only help me so much. My only other idea so far is to do hanging leg lifts more explosively, but this will probably be pretty annoying b/c each set will require a lot of time to stop my momentum and reset. (Though on the other hand, maybe stopping my momentum will also mimic what you have to do on the rock once you've stuck the move?) I also wonder if deadlifts will help for this, though much of the power for this type of move has to come from abs, not lower back or hamstrings.

Maybe users like /u/eshlow and the climbers and gymnasts on this subreddit in particular will have some good ideas.

ohneEigenschaften01: I understand your skepticism re core power for sit starts.

I mean, I have room to improve all over--finger strength, arm/shoulder strength, back strength, *technique*! But for the rest of these I know exactly how to work on it.
darrensurrey: Well, from an overhanging sit start you are trying to keep your feet from touching the ground but that does not require ""explosive"" core power. It requires you to just engage the core to keep your feet off the ground. If this is the case, then try hanging L-sits.

sad,id958,human," of new approaches to understand the glass transition. One such approach is the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) theory, which was first proposed by Parisi (1980) and has since been extensively studied and refined (Parisi, 1984; Kirkpatrick and Thirumalai, 1987).

The RSB theory posits that the glass transition is characterized by a breaking of the replica symmetry, which is a fundamental concept in statistical physics. According to this theory, the glass transition is a phase transition that occurs when the system's free energy landscape becomes highly complex and rugged, making it difficult for the system to find the global minimum energy configuration. This complexity arises from the interactions between the particles in the system, which lead to the formation of a large number of metastable states.

The RSB theory has been successful in explaining many of the observed features of the glass transition, such as the non-exponential relaxation of the system and the presence of a glass transition temperature. However, it is still a highly debated topic in the scientific community, and many researchers have proposed alternative theories to explain the glass transition.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to the study of the glass transition. These techniques have been used to simulate the behavior of complex systems and to identify patterns and correlations in the data that may not be apparent to the human eye. For example, a recent study used a neural network to predict the glass transition temperature of a variety of glass-forming liquids (Biroli and Bouchaud, 2014).

Overall, the glass transition remains a challenging and fascinating problem in condensed matter physics, and it is likely that continued research will lead to a deeper understanding of this phenomenon and its applications in fields such as materials science and biology."," of theories of structural glasses (Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai and Wolynes, 1989; Barrat, Franz and Parisi, 1997; M\'ezard and Parisi, 1999; Lubchenko and Wolynes, 2007; Biroli and Bouchaud, 2012) based on the scenario of spin glass transition. This scenario though looks very appealing is still far from being well established. One of the main differences between standard spin systems to molecular systems is the absence of quenched disorder and the presence of translational invariance: it often assumed that this difference is not relevant, but this conjecture is still far from being established. The quantities, which are well defined and characterized for spin models, are not easily calculable for molecular glasses due to the lack of quenched disorder which breaks the translational invariance in the system and the characterization of the similarity between the spin and the structural glass transition remained an elusive subject still now. In this study we introduced a model structural glass with built in quenched disorder which alleviates this main difference between the spin and molecular glasses thereby helping us to compare these two systems: the possibility of producing a good thermalization at rather low temperatures is one of the advantages of this model."

This model assumes that the probability of success is a beta distribution, and the number of successes is a binomial distribution. Another example is the negative binomial model, which is used to model count data with overdispersion.

In addition to overdispersion models, the exponential family can also be extended to accommodate hierarchical structure in the data. This is often done using mixed effects models, which combine the advantages of linear regression and generalized linear models. These models allow for the estimation of both fixed and random effects, which can be used to model the relationships between variables at multiple levels. For example, in a study of student performance, a mixed effects model could be used to estimate the effects of different teaching methods on student outcomes, while also accounting for the clustering of students within classrooms.

Another way to accommodate hierarchical structure is through the use of hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLMs). These models extend the exponential family to include a hierarchical structure, allowing for the estimation of both fixed and random effects at multiple levels. HGLMs are particularly useful when the data exhibits a complex structure, such as clustering or nesting, and when the relationships between variables are non-linear. For example, in a study of customer satisfaction, a HGLM could be used to estimate the effects of different marketing strategies on customer satisfaction, while also accounting for the clustering of customers within regions.

In conclusion, the exponential family is a powerful tool for modeling non-Gaussian outcomes, and it has been extended in various ways to accommodate overdispersion and hierarchical structure in the data. Overdispersion models, such as the beta-binomial and negative binomial models, are used to model binary and count data with overdispersion, while mixed effects models and HGLMs are used to accommodate hierarchical structure in the data. These models are particularly useful when the data exhibits a complex structure, and when the relationships between variables are non-linear."," model for grouped binary data and the negative-binomial model for counts. Clustering is often accommodated through the inclusion of random subject-specific effects. Though not always, one conventionally assumes such random effects to be normally distributed. While both of these phenomena may occur simultaneously, models combining them are uncommon. This paper proposes a broad class of generalized linear models accommodating overdispersion and clustering through two separate sets of random effects. We place particular emphasis on so-called conjugate random effects at the level of the mean for the first aspect and normal random effects embedded within the linear predictor for the second aspect, even though our family is more general. The binary, count and time-to-event cases are given particular emphasis. Apart from model formulation, we present an overview of estimation methods, and then settle for maximum likelihood estimation with analytic--numerical integration. Implications for the derivation of marginal correlations functions are discussed. The methodology is applied to data from a study in epileptic seizures, a clinical trial in toenail infection named onychomycosis and survival data in children with asthma."

As we delve deeper into the history of the $2 bill, it becomes clear that the design and issuance of this denomination have undergone significant changes over the years. The current design of the $2 bill, featuring a portrait of Thomas Jefferson, was introduced in 1963 and has remained largely unchanged since then. However, the bill's backing and the materials used to print it have undergone significant changes.

Prior to 1963, the $2 bill was backed by silver reserves, which meant that the value of the bill was tied to the value of silver. This was reflected in the design of the bill, which featured a silver certificate number in the lower right corner. However, with the introduction of the Federal Reserve Note in 1963, the $2 bill was no longer backed by silver reserves and the design of the bill was changed to reflect this.

In addition to the changes in the design and backing of the $2 bill, the materials used to print the bill have also undergone significant changes. Prior to 1963, the $2 bill was printed on a special type of paper that was infused with a chemical that made it difficult to counterfeit. However, with the introduction of the Federal Reserve Note, the paper used to print the bill was changed to a standard type of paper that is used to print all denominations of US currency.

Despite these changes, the $2 bill remains a unique and interesting denomination of US currency. Its history and design are a reflection of the country's economic and financial system, and it continues to be a popular collector's item among numismatists and currency enthusiasts.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the $2 bill, particularly among collectors and enthusiasts of US currency. This has led to a surge in the value of certain rare and collectible $2 bills, such as those with errors or misprints. Additionally, the $2 bill has become a popular item among tourists and travelers, who often seek out unique and exotic currencies to add to their collection.

As the world of currency continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how the $2 bill adapts to new technologies and trends. Will it continue to be a popular collector's item, or will it become a relic of the past? Only time will tell, but for now, the $2 bill remains a unique and fascinating piece of US currency."," certificates had blue seals, USNs red.

The model, which we call the Generalized Random Graph Diffusion Model (GRGDM), is designed to simulate the spread of information through a network, taking into account the complex relationships between nodes and the heterogeneity of the network. We use this model to analyze the effectiveness of different marketing strategies and to identify the most influential nodes in the network. Our results show that the GRGDM can accurately predict the spread of information and identify the most effective marketing strategies.

In addition to its ability to predict the spread of information, the GRGDM can also be used to identify the most influential nodes in the network. These nodes, which we call ""influencers,"" are the nodes that have the greatest impact on the spread of information. By identifying these influencers, marketers can target them with their campaigns, increasing the likelihood of success. We use the GRGDM to identify the most influential nodes in a sample network and show that these nodes are indeed the most effective at spreading information.

The GRGDM can also be used to analyze the impact of different network structures on the spread of information. For example, we can use the model to analyze the impact of clustering, the degree distribution, and community structure on the spread of information. Our results show that these network structures can have a significant impact on the spread of information and that the GRGDM can accurately capture these effects.

In conclusion, the GRGDM is a powerful tool for analyzing the spread of information through networks and for identifying the most effective marketing strategies. By using the GRGDM, marketers can better understand how to target their campaigns and increase their chances of success."," (a.k.a. configuration model) to provide insight into these questions. We offer the intuition behind the results on this model, rigorously proved in Blaszczyszyn & Gaurav(2013), and illustrate them here by taking examples of random networks having prototypical degree distributions - Poisson degree distribution, which is commonly used as a kind of benchmark, and Power Law degree distribution, which is normally used to approximate the real-world networks. On these networks, the members are assumed to have varying attitudes towards propagating the information. We analyze three cases, in particular - (1) Bernoulli transmissions, when a member influences each of its friend with probability p; (2) Node percolation, when a member influences all its friends with probability p and none with probability 1-p; (3) Coupon-collector transmissions, when a member randomly selects one of his friends K times with replacement. We assume that the configuration model is the closest approximation of a large online social network, when the information available about the network is very limited. The key insight offered by this study from a firm's perspective is regarding how to evaluate the effectiveness of a marketing campaign and do cost-benefit analysis by collecting relevant statistical data from the pioneers it selects. The campaign evaluation criterion is informed by the observation that if the parameters of the underlying network and the campaign effectiveness are such that the campaign can indeed reach a significant fraction of the population, then the set of good pioneers also forms a significant fraction of the population. Therefore, in such a case, the firms can even adopt the naive strategy of repeatedly picking and targeting some number of pioneers at random from the population. With this strategy, the probability of them picking a good pioneer will increase geometrically fast with the number of tries."

I was going to try and find a way to get her alone, maybe get her away from the crowd and have a proper conversation with her. But as the night went on, I started to get more and more nervous. What if she didn't feel the same way? What if she thought I was just being silly or that I was reading too much into things? The thoughts were swirling in my head, making it harder and harder for me to muster up the courage to take the leap.


But then, something unexpected happened. We found ourselves at the same table, just the two of us, and the music was getting louder and the crowd was getting more rowdy. I looked into her eyes and saw something there that made my heart skip a beat. It was like she was waiting for me to make my move, like she was hoping that I would take the chance and tell her how I felt. And in that moment, I knew I had to do it. I took a deep breath, grabbed her hand, and pulled her close. ""Hey,"" I said, my voice shaking slightly. ""Can I talk to you for a minute?"" She looked up at me with a curious expression, and I knew I had her attention.","'s told me about this other guy that she's seeing but doesn't consider to be dating him, just ""Seeing/Texting"" him and she had met up with him that day before the lunchtime we had when she was meeting me a while after. So she did so, and still met me but 30 minutes late. According to her, she never really knows what to say to him sometimes and from my perspective it seems as if I have a much better shot with her than he does. 


So I said I'd do my best to get out that night and I did. I was full throttle heading over reading to just kiss her and let her know everything, and I've never been that confident with a girl in my life. I approached the line to get in - but as I did, there she was standing there with that other guy I'm pretty sure both of us spotted each other instantly but didn't acknowledge as it just seems much too awkward of a time. She left, and all I got was a wave and a week prior of basically wanting me, not many girls are THAT into me, so I really like her and I feel nearly broken.


I'm still getting to see her on Monday cus college and I have a feeling that she'll just act as if nothing has happened. A) Because I'm not sure if she knows that I like her that much and B) Because she probably didn't take it that seriously from her viewpoint to be fair it probably doesn't seem like much happened.


I still like her, and although I feel kind of hurt. I don't want to stop speaking to her because nothing inherently bad happened. I just like her a lot and want things to work, I'm going to be as honest as I can with her and let her know that I was just going to see her, I'm fairly sure she thinks I like her and that's okay but I'll also let her know that that situation made me uncomfortable, I basically get emotionally attached way too quickly but the week we had was filled with flirting and she seems more interested in me from my perspective than him.
Kaleopolitus: So, yeah, sounds like you've got your plan sorted out.

Telling the girl you like her? Check.

Informing her that what she did hurt you? Check.

The only advice I can give you here is to get a better grip on your emotions. What you tell yourself can become your reality, given enough willpower behind it. Even if you get emotionally attached fast, you can still slow it down by repeatedly reminding yourself of what has happened and how much it implies and means so far.

Also, please... PLEASE prepare yourself for potential disappointment. It sounds to me like she's double dipping. While she may be faithful in a relationship, the fact that she's seeing two guys at once in an interested fashion... this could go wrong fast.

The well-founded semantics for LPAma programs provides a foundation for the development of efficient and scalable algorithms for solving logic programs with aggregates. By analyzing the properties of the well-founded model, we can identify the key factors that influence the behavior of the program and develop strategies for optimizing its performance. For instance, we can use the well-founded model to determine the most relevant clauses in the program and focus our optimization efforts on those clauses. Additionally, the well-founded semantics can be used to detect and handle inconsistencies in the program, ensuring that the program produces accurate and reliable results.

Furthermore, the generalization of the notions of unfounded set and well-founded semantics for LPAma programs opens up new avenues for research in logic programming. For example, we can explore the application of LPAma programs to real-world problems, such as data mining and knowledge discovery, where the use of aggregates can provide valuable insights and patterns. We can also investigate the development of new programming languages and systems that support the use of aggregates in logic programs, and explore the integration of LPAma programs with other AI and machine learning techniques. Overall, the generalization of the notions of unfounded set and well-founded semantics for LPAma programs is a significant contribution to the field of logic programming, and has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach the development and analysis of logic programs with aggregates."," model, together with a strong relationship to the answer set semantics for LPAma programs. We show that one of the D-well-founded semantics, defined by Pelov, Denecker, and Bruynooghe for a broader class of aggregates using approximating operators, coincides with the well-founded model as defined in this work on LPAma programs. We also discuss some complexity issues, most importantly we give a formal proof of tractable computation of the well-founded model for LPA programs. Moreover, we prove that for general LPA programs, which may contain aggregates that are neither monotone nor antimonotone, deciding satisfaction of aggregate expressions with respect to partial interpretations is coNP-complete. As a consequence, a well-founded semantics for general LPA programs that allows for tractable computation is unlikely to exist, which justifies the restriction on LPAma programs. Finally, we present a prototype system extending DLV, which supports the well-founded semantics for LPAma programs, at the time of writing the only implemented system that does so. Experiments with this prototype show significant computational advantages of aggregate constructs over equivalent aggregate-free encodings."

Considering these constraints, I would recommend exploring the possibility of installing the evaporative cooling system in the basement, which would not only provide a quiet and low-maintenance solution but also take advantage of the natural insulation provided by the earth. Here are a few potential options to consider:

1. Installing the evaporative cooler in a basement window well, similar to what we did in our previous house. This would provide a quiet and discreet installation, and the cooler could be easily accessed for maintenance.

2. Installing the evaporative cooler in a basement egress window, similar to what we did in our previous house. This would provide a similar benefit to the first option, but would also allow for more flexibility in terms of placement and design.

3. Installing the evaporative cooler in a basement room or area that is not used as living space. This could be a great option if you have an unused room or area in your basement that could be converted into a dedicated cooling zone.

4. Installing a ductless evaporative cooling system, which would allow you to install the cooler in a basement room or area and then distribute the cooled air to other areas of the house through a network of ductless vents.

In terms of design, I would recommend consulting with a professional to ensure that the system is properly sized and installed to meet your specific needs and requirements. Additionally, I would recommend exploring the possibility of integrating the evaporative cooling system with other energy-efficient features, such as solar panels or a tankless water heater, to create a comprehensive and sustainable cooling solution.

It's also important to consider the local building codes and regulations, as well as the specific requirements of your neighborhood, when designing and installing the evaporative cooling system. A professional can help you navigate these complexities and ensure that your system is installed in compliance with all relevant regulations.

* The windows in the basement are not large enough for egress (and I'm not quite ready to bite off that project--which is likely going to require a future post).  We'd want a larger unit than in our previous house, anyway, so window wells aren't going to work, this time.

* No existing duct-work.

So, I'd like to run a larger evaporative cooler on the ground (or thereabouts), and run the air into the basement.  It looks like I could probably blow the air into the basement through the (wood) wall between the floor joists, immediately above the foundation's cement walls...but I'm wondering if there's a better way (read: ""is that unreasonable?"").

Assuming I can get the air into ducts situated between the joists, I'd like to ultimately direct the air into the main level.  I'd love to have a register (or several, depending on CFM requirements) in the wall(s) of the entryway, but I'm not sure what to expect when it comes to running ductwork from an open space (the basement) into a (non-load-bearing) wall cavity.

So: Am I out of my mind?  Should I lower my end-result expectations?
arizona-lad: So, if you have not have forced air for heating, are you using electric or hydronic rads throughout the house?

A whole house evaporative cooler for a large home will have ducts around 20"" X 20"", or even 24"" x 24"".   Do you have some closets perhaps, that you can use to travel between floors and act as a place to run the ductwork through?

My cooler outputs 6500 cubic feet per minute.  Waaay more than an A/C, so the ducts need to accommodate the much higher air flow.
TreDubZedd: The house currently runs electric baseboard heaters throughout.  I'd ultimately like to replace them with in-ceiling radiant heating (probably also electric, rather than hydronic), but that's a project for another time.

I recognize that a cooler like this is going to have large exhaust (and intake) requirements.  I think if I run three ducts between floor joists, I might be close enough (while allowing for some air to blow into the basement itself)--each would be 16"" x 8"", at least.

Ultimately, I'm less concerned about how to get the air circulating through the house than how to get it *into* the house.

Further analysis of the data reveals that the fission-like phenomenon is characterized by a high degree of symmetry in the fragment distribution, with a strong preference for the emission of light fragments with atomic numbers below 10. The observed odd-even staggering in the light-fragment yields is attributed to the presence of shell effects in the emitting nucleus, which influence the fragmentation process. The magnitude of the staggering is found to be independent of the neutron content of the emitting system, suggesting that the shell effects are dominant in determining the fragmentation pattern.

The fragment-particle coincidence data also provide insight into the excitation energies of the light partners in very asymmetric fission. The results suggest that the light partners are emitted either cold or at excitation energies below the particle emission threshold, indicating that the fragmentation process is driven by the emission of particles from the excited nucleus. This is in contrast to the case of symmetric fission, where the light partners are typically emitted at higher excitation energies.

The observed fission-like phenomenon in the $^{78,82}$Kr + $^{40}$Ca reactions is attributed to the presence of a strong quadrupole deformation in the emitting nucleus, which leads to a high degree of relaxation and a preference for the emission of light fragments. The results provide new insights into the decay modes of excited nuclei and highlight the importance of shell effects in determining the fragmentation pattern. Future studies will focus on the investigation of the fission-like phenomenon in other reactions and the development of new theoretical models to describe the fragmentation process."," thresholds. The evaporation residue cross-section of the $^{78}$Kr + $^{40}$Ca reaction is slightly higher than the one measured in $^{82}$Kr + $^{40}$Ca reaction. The fission-like component is larger by $\sim$ 25% for the reaction having the lowest neutron-to-proton ratio. These experimental features are confronted to the predictions of theoretical models. The Hauser-Feshbach approach including the emission of fragments up to $Z$ = 14 in their ground states as well as excited states does not account for the main features of $\sigma_{Z}$. For both reactions, the transition-state formalism reasonably reproduces the $Z$-distribution of the fragments with charge 12 $\le Z \le$ 28. However, this model strongly overestimates the light-fragment cross-sections and does not explain the o-e-s of the yields for 6 $\le Z \le$ 10. The shape of the whole $Z$-distribution and the o-e-s of the light-fragment yields are satisfactorily reproduced within the dinuclear system framework which treats the competition between evaporation, fusion-fission and quasifission processes. The model suggests that heavy fragments come mainly from quasifission while light fragments are predominantly populated by fusion. An underestimation of the cross sections for 16 $\le Z \le$ 22 could signal a mechanism in addition to the capture process."

sad,id1355,human," understanding of the trade-offs between privacy, utility, and complexity in the design of secure and efficient communication systems.

The CLUB model is built upon the concept of bottleneck problems, which are defined as optimization problems that aim to minimize the difference between two probability distributions, typically referred to as the ""source"" and ""target"" distributions. The CLUB model extends this concept by incorporating additional constraints and objectives, such as the complexity of the optimization problem, the leakage of sensitive information, and the utility of the optimized solution. This allows the model to capture a wide range of optimization problems, including those related to privacy, fairness, and information-theoretic performance bounds.

One of the key contributions of the CLUB model is its ability to provide a unified theoretical framework for understanding the relationships between these different optimization problems. By casting these problems within the same mathematical framework, the CLUB model enables researchers to leverage insights and techniques from one problem domain to tackle challenges in another. This, in turn, can lead to more efficient and effective solutions to complex optimization problems.

The CLUB model also provides new insights into the design of secure and efficient communication systems. By optimizing the trade-offs between privacy, utility, and complexity, the model can help system designers to develop more robust and resilient communication systems that are better equipped to handle the challenges of modern communication networks. Furthermore, the CLUB model can be used to analyze the performance of existing communication systems, providing valuable insights into how to improve their security and efficiency.

In conclusion, the complexity-leakage-utility bottleneck (CLUB) model is a powerful tool for tackling a wide range of optimization problems in machine learning and information theory. By providing a unified theoretical framework for understanding the relationships between these problems, the CLUB model has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach optimization in these domains."," generative compression models, and (iv) can be used in the fair generative models. We first formulate the CLUB model as a complexity-constrained privacy-utility optimization problem. We then connect it with the closely related bottleneck problems, namely information bottleneck (IB), privacy funnel (PF), deterministic IB (DIB), conditional entropy bottleneck (CEB), and conditional PF (CPF). We show that the CLUB model generalizes all these problems as well as most other information-theoretic privacy models. Then, we construct the deep variational CLUB (DVCLUB) models by employing neural networks to parameterize variational approximations of the associated information quantities. Building upon these information quantities, we present unified objectives of the supervised and unsupervised DVCLUB models. Leveraging the DVCLUB model in an unsupervised setup, we then connect it with state-of-the-art generative models, such as variational auto-encoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), as well as the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), Wasserstein auto-encoder (WAE), and adversarial auto-encoder (AAE) models through the optimal transport (OT) problem. We then show that the DVCLUB model can also be used in fair representation learning problems, where the goal is to mitigate the undesired bias during the training phase of a machine learning model. We conduct extensive quantitative experiments on colored-MNIST and CelebA datasets, with a public implementation available, to evaluate and analyze the CLUB model."

This approach is often time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it provides a high degree of confidence in the integrity of the resulting build.

The other approach, known as the ""hybrid"" approach, involves using a combination of the old and new versions of the language implementation. This can be done by using the old version as a starting point and gradually applying the changes made in the new version, allowing the creation of a new version that can be built without relying on the opaque binary. This approach is often faster and more efficient than the archaeological approach, but it may not provide the same level of confidence in the integrity of the resulting build.

In addition to these two approaches, debootstrapping can also involve using other techniques, such as using a different build system or compiler, or using a different programming language to implement the language implementation. These approaches can provide additional benefits, such as improved portability or better support for certain features.

One of the key challenges in debootstrapping is ensuring the integrity of the resulting build. This can be done by using techniques such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration. These techniques can help ensure that the resulting build is correct and free of bugs, and that it can be trusted to implement the language correctly.

Overall, debootstrapping is an important step in ensuring the security and integrity of programming languages. By removing the need for opaque binaries and providing alternative build paths, debootstrapping can help prevent the trusting trust attack and ensure that language implementations are trustworthy and reliable."," by locating old versions of systems, or legacy alternative implementations, that do not need the bootstrap, and by preserving or restoring the ability to run them. The ""tailored"" approach re-implements a new, non-bootstrapped implementation of the system to debootstrap. Currently, the ""tailored"" approach is dominant for low-level system components (C, coreutils), and the ""archaeological"" approach is dominant among the few higher-level languages that were debootstrapped. Approach: We advocate for the benefits of ""tailored"" debootstrapping implementations of high-level languages. The new implementation needs not be production-ready, it suffices that it is able to run the reference implementation correctly. We argue that this is feasible with a reasonable development effort, with several side benefits besides debootstrapping. Knowledge: We propose a specific design of composing/stacking several implementations: a reference interpreter for the language of interest, implemented in a small subset of the language, and a compiler for this small subset (in another language). Developing a reference interpreter is valuable independently of debootstrapping: it may help clarify the language semantics, and can be reused for other purposes such as differential testing of the other implementations. Grounding: We present Camlboot, our project to debootstrap the OCaml compiler, version 4.07. Once we converged on this final design, the last version of Camlboot took about a person-month of implementation effort, demonstrating feasibility. Using diverse double-compilation, we were able to prove the absence of trusting trust attack in the existing bootstrap of the standard OCaml implementation. Importance: To our knowledge, this document is the first scholarly discussion of ""tailored"" debootstrapping for high-level programming languages. Debootstrapping is an interesting problem which recently grew an active community of free software contributors, but so far the interactions with the programming-language research community have been minimal. We share our experience on Camlboot, trying to highlight aspects that are of interest to other language designers and implementors; we hope to foster stronger ties between the Bootstrappable project and relevant academic communities. In particular, the debootstrapping experience has been an interesting reflection on OCaml design and implementation, and we hope that other language implementors would find it equally valuable."

The proposed estimator is expected to provide a better trade-off between the bias and variance of the regression coefficients, especially in high-dimensional settings where the number of covariates is large.

The main idea behind the proposed estimator is to use a combination of the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms as penalty terms. The $\ell_1$ norm is used to induce sparsity in the regression coefficients, while the $\ell_2$ norm is used to reduce the magnitude of the coefficients. This combination of penalty terms allows the proposed estimator to handle both sparse and dense problems, and to provide a better trade-off between the bias and variance of the regression coefficients. The proposed estimator is expected to be particularly useful in high-dimensional settings where the number of covariates is large, and where the relationships between the covariates and the response variable are complex.

The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated using a simulation study, where the estimator is compared to other popular regression estimators, such as the Lasso and the Elastic-Net. The results of the simulation study show that the proposed estimator outperforms the other estimators in terms of prediction accuracy, and that it is particularly effective in high-dimensional settings where the number of covariates is large."," between variables may exist; and the Smooth-Lasso $\hat{\beta}^{SL}$, which responds to sparse problems where successive regression coefficients are known to vary slowly (in some situations, this can also be interpreted in terms of correlations between successive variables). From a theoretical point of view, we establish variable selection consistency results and show that $\hat{\beta}^{Quad}$ achieves a Sparsity Inequality, \textit i.e., a bound in terms of the number of non-zero components of the 'true' regression vector. These results are provided under a weaker assumption on the Gram matrix than the one used by the Lasso. In some situations this guarantees a significant improvement over the Lasso. Furthermore, a simulation study is conducted and shows that the S-Lasso $\hat{\beta}^{SL}$ performs better than known methods as the Lasso, the Elastic-Net $\hat{\beta}^{EN}$, and the Fused-Lasso with respect to the estimation accuracy. This is especially the case when the regression vector is 'smooth', \textit i.e., when the variations between successive coefficients of the unknown parameter of the regression are small. The study also reveals that the theoretical calibration of the tuning parameters and the one based on 10 fold cross validation imply two S-Lasso solutions with close performance."

Nighthawk321: Another classic case of able-bodied people creating a problem that doesn't exist, and then creating a solution for it. Notice how many blind people they consulted on this. 

Source, blind accessibility advocate/consultant.
congoLIPSSSSS: &gt;Notice how many blind people they consulted on this.

How do you know they didn’t consult any blind or visually impaired people?
 
Also what’s the issue with this device? It gives people walking directions without needing them to look at a GPS or a phone. 

I mean if you think it’s a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist then don’t buy it, but I’m sure someone is gonna find it useful.

It's true that the device may not be a solution to a problem that everyone can relate to, but for those who are visually impaired, it could be a game-changer. Imagine being able to walk down the street without having to rely on a cane or a guide dog, or being able to navigate through a crowded public place without feeling anxious or overwhelmed. This device could provide a sense of independence and freedom that many people take for granted.

Of course, it's also important to consider the potential drawbacks of this device. For example, it may require a significant amount of training and practice to use effectively, which could be a barrier for some people. Additionally, there may be concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the device, particularly in complex or unfamiliar environments.

Despite these potential drawbacks, it's clear that the creators of this device are committed to making it a useful and accessible tool for people with visual impairments. They have consulted with experts in the field and have worked to ensure that the device is user-friendly and easy to use.

In conclusion, while this device may not be a solution to a problem that everyone can relate to, it could be a valuable tool for people with visual impairments. It's important to approach this device with an open mind and to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks before making a judgment.",": Because they absolutely would have and should have stated it in their announcement. The issue is that blind people don't need walking directions in the first place, therefore creating a solution to a problem that blind people don't have. If they had reached out to any blind organization, they would have said the exact same thing I'm saying now. All over Twitter, for example, blind people are simply laughing at this product.
DownvotePlusSoulTrap: I don't meant to be contrarian, but blind people don't all have the same needs or opinions. I'm a paratransit bus driver and work with visually impaired people on a daily basis. Some of them get around all right, some of them find it very challenging even with guide dogs and the ""advantage"" of having been blind since birth. Some of them are recently blind and having a terrible time of it. I don't know how many of them will use something like this. Certainly not all or none, but I'm at least going to mention this to them in case they want to look into it for themselves.
Nighthawk321: You're not being contrarian, but with all due respect, I'm also blind. I certainly don't speak for other blind people, but I and many other advocates on social media all agree that this isn't necessary.
IAmMrMacgee: Why does it have to be necessary? Why can't it just be a product that helps the people who it needs to help? Why does Honda have to make some massively game changing product for blind people for this to be appreciated?
Nighthawk321: Copying and pasting a comment I made:

The problem is that blind people already have a way to navigate independently via a cane or guide dog. These shoes only enhance the cane/guide dog experience, but they don't actually bring anything new to the table. Blind people will still be able to navigate as easily as before. These shoes, for example, won't fix any of the various issues blind people will have when crossing an intersections, unlike accessible crossing signs and truncated domes would, a standard that is already set. Furthermore, GPS' are not precise enough to be useful yet. So yes, this would enhance traveling marginally for the average blind person, but the blind community would rather prefer people to work on things that aren't accessible at all yet. This is why it is important to talk to various blind organizations for feedback.
IAmMrMacgee: I'm going to copy and paste a little section from the article

&gt;While the device isn’t going to replace the old standard white cane any time soon, this is a step in the right direction (get it?). By allowing the visually impaired to navigate without constantly keeping direction and distances in mind, this device makes it possible for the user to walk in a more relaxed fashion. Focusing on the things around them, rather than what direction they need to be pointed, also makes walking safer. Wouldn’t you enjoy a safer and more relaxing walk?

This isn't meant to replace anything, but its meant to up the quality of life for visually impaired people 

I really see no reason for the bashing or criticism of this
EvansFamilyLego: You can't see the reason?

You can't...see... 

Okay. I'll see myself out. Oh damn it... I did it too.

sad,id841,human," exceptionally well when the oracle is not available, and the true model is not known a priori. In such cases, the OLS post-Lasso estimator can still provide a good approximation of the true regression function, as long as the Lasso-based model selection is not too far off the mark.

In addition, the OLS post-Lasso estimator has several other advantages over Lasso. For one, it is more robust to outliers and noisy data, since it is less sensitive to the choice of regularization parameter. This is because the OLS post-Lasso estimator is based on a more robust statistical procedure, which is less prone to overfitting and more resistant to the influence of noisy data. Furthermore, the OLS post-Lasso estimator can be used in conjunction with other statistical methods, such as cross-validation and regularization, to improve its performance and robustness.

In conclusion, the OLS post-Lasso estimator is a powerful and flexible tool for estimating nonparametric regression functions, and can be used in a wide range of applications, including finance, economics, and medicine. Its ability to perform well even when the oracle is not available, and its robustness to outliers and noisy data, make it a valuable addition to the toolkit of any statistician or data analyst."," strictly better than Lasso, in the sense of a strictly faster rate of convergence, if the Lasso-based model selection correctly includes all components of the ""true"" model as a subset and also achieves sufficient sparsity. In the extreme case, when Lasso perfectly selects the ""true"" model, the OLS post-Lasso estimator becomes the oracle estimator. An important ingredient in our analysis is a new sparsity bound on the dimension of the model selected by Lasso, which guarantees that this dimension is at most of the same order as the dimension of the ""true"" model. Our rate results are nonasymptotic and hold in both parametric and nonparametric models. Moreover, our analysis is not limited to the Lasso estimator acting as a selector in the first step, but also applies to any other estimator, for example, various forms of thresholded Lasso, with good rates and good sparsity properties. Our analysis covers both traditional thresholding and a new practical, data-driven thresholding scheme that induces additional sparsity subject to maintaining a certain goodness of fit. The latter scheme has theoretical guarantees similar to those of Lasso or OLS post-Lasso, but it dominates those procedures as well as traditional thresholding in a wide variety of experiments."
sad,id1679,human," can be beneficial for a few reasons: it allows you to focus on a specific area of your training, which can help you make progress faster, and it also gives you a chance to recover from the intense training by giving your muscles a break.

For example, if you're doing a strength-focused program like PPL, you can split your training into upper body and lower body days, or even further into specific muscle groups like chest and triceps. This allows you to hit each muscle group hard and make progress in a specific area, rather than trying to train everything in one session. Additionally, by giving your muscles a break, you can recover more efficiently and come back stronger for your next workout.

Another benefit of splits is that it can help you avoid plateaus. When you're doing the same workout routine over and over again, your body can get used to it and you may not see the same level of progress. By changing up your routine and focusing on different muscle groups, you can shock your muscles and stimulate growth again. This is especially important for intermediate lifters who may have already made significant progress and are looking for ways to continue improving.

Of course, there are also some potential downsides to consider. For example, if you're not careful, you can end up overtraining or undertraining specific muscle groups. It's also important to make sure that you're not sacrificing overall strength and muscle mass for the sake of specialization. A good split routine should still allow you to make progress in all areas of your training, rather than just focusing on one or two specific areas.

Overall, periodization and splits can be a powerful tool for intermediate lifters looking to take their training to the next level. By focusing on specific muscle groups and changing up their routine, they can avoid plateaus and continue making progress. However, it's important to approach this type of training with caution and make sure that you're not sacrificing overall strength and muscle mass for the sake of specialization."," are frowned upon for beginners, yeah, because they really don't need them yet (necessary workload isn't high enough to make full-body sessions super long and tiring, motor skills and 3x/week frequency are most important), but splits for more advanced trainees is just a fact of practical necessity that isn't subject to our opinions/culture here.
WolfeyRages: When would you say someone is due for a split? Ive been on the routine for almost half a year now and I'm up to 60% bodyweight max dip and around 30% bodyweight added for 6 reps on pull-up to give a rough idea 
pumpasaurus: You can't really base it on strength - it's mainly how your progress has been, and what your goals are. 

Basically, if you are still getting results, then you have the luxury of being able to choose whatever training structure you want. A full-body routine is the most time-efficient and usually involves the least amount of total work.

If you stall out and stop making any progress, and you're not feeling totally beat up (deload necessary), then the culprit is not doing enough work. Adding work might still allow a full-body routine, but the more work you do, the more sense it makes to split up the workouts so that you can focus and put the work in without having super long sessions.
WolfeyRages: I'm able to progress strength wise, it just only seems to work with low reps high intensity 
pumpasaurus: That's a good place to be.

If higher volume doesn't work for you, there's two reasons why: first, it's always less direct to train max strength in any way other than just directly progressing your intensity with higher weights (what you're doing), and as long as you can do it, you should - second, if you never do higher volume, your work capacity is probably fairly low, so you'd need to get used to higher volume in the first place for it to work.

Eventually the low-reps-high-intensity approach will stall out (unless you're a freak with great potential and you kind of achieve all your goals before it becomes necessary to mess with periodization and volume manipulation, which does happen), and it will require just adding extra work in order to have the body recognize that there's something happening that requires it to adapt.
WolfeyRages: I definitely have low muscular endurance, I can't do more than 8 unweighted pull-ups which I will focus on for hypertrophy when the time comes, but for now I will take advantage of the low rep, hopefully it doesn't stall out before I achieve a few goals, but if it does atleast I know what I need to do, thanks

sad,id1557,human," all. But would vegans really want that? I mean, think about it. No more milk, no more cheese, no more leather, no more wool. Would we really be better off without these products? And what about the jobs that rely on the livestock industry? Farmers, butchers, dairy workers, and so on. Would we really be willing to sacrifice their livelihoods for the sake of animal welfare?

Perhaps a more nuanced approach is needed. One that acknowledges the complex relationships between humans, animals, and the environment. Maybe we could find ways to reduce our reliance on animal products, while still allowing for the existence of livestock animals. After all, many farmers do prioritize animal welfare and use sustainable practices. Maybe we could incentivize more of these practices, and work towards a more balanced and sustainable food system.

But what about the emotional connection we have with animals? Do we really want to live in a world where cows are just seen as commodities, devoid of any emotional value? Or can we find a way to coexist with them, recognizing their inherent value as living beings? Perhaps we could explore alternative forms of agriculture, such as regenerative farming, that prioritize soil health, biodiversity, and animal welfare.

Ultimately, the question of whether vegans would welcome a world with no livestock animals is complex and multifaceted. It requires us to confront our own biases and assumptions about animal welfare, food production, and the human-animal relationship. It also requires us to think creatively about the kind of world we want to live in, and the kind of relationships we want to have with the animals that inhabit it.

As we grapple with these questions, it's clear that there is no easy answer. But by engaging in open and honest discussions, we can work towards a more compassionate and sustainable world, where humans and animals can coexist in harmony."," all. 

The answer isn’t to ban eating animals (though I do assert that some people/ countries eat too much poor quality &amp; cheap meat) popular culture needs to change. We all need to try to buy local &amp; welfare quality assured produce. 

The death of an animal is not a big deal. Poor treatment of them while they are alive is.
Tinac4: &gt; The death of an animal is not a big deal. Poor treatment of them while they are alive is.

How universally do you apply this principle?

Consider a hypothetical human society where a number of kids are raised under the best possible conditions.  All of them are happy and satisfied, until they are killed painlessly and without warning at the age of 15.  Is this ethical?  If not, what makes this scenario different?
[deleted]: Depends on your definition of 'ethics'. I argue that it wouldn't be unethical to kill 'isolately'. To kill any living being is 'fine' as long as their death does not inflict suffering on other living beings. For example, to kill a calf would be 'wrong' because their mother would suffer by cause of their death.

However, if said calf existed in isolation and their death did not cause emotional or physical harm on others – and the procedure was to be done painlessly – I can see no problem with their murder. It does not matter if it is an individual of our species or another's.
Tinac4: I personally disagree--I'm more of a preference utilitarian than a classical utilitarian--but I see where you're coming from.  It does seem to me that your position leads to some unintuitive results, though.  For instance, if you came across a sleeping homeless man, you had a method to kill him painlessly and take his money, and you knew with certainty that nobody would care about or notice his death, would it be ethical to kill him?  (Obviously, this involves a lot of simplifications that don't apply in real life.)
[deleted]: &gt; would it be ethical to kill him?

I suppose we're having a mature discussion here so I'm going to answer honestly. Simply put, yes. But then again, that's according to MY definition of 'ethics' as I stated in the earlier comment.

As long as the procedure is done in a peaceful and painless manner, I really can't see how that would be a bad thing. It may help if I clarify that I'm an atheist who doesn't believe in afterlife, so to me death isn't anything gruesome.
Tinac4: Fair enough!  I think that the scenario you described would be bad, but only on the basis of my own ethical intuitions, and those intuitions definitely aren't universal.

sad,id1597,human,", the article you linked does not support your claim that selective breeding is genetic modification. It actually defines genetic modification as ""the direct manipulation of an organism's genetic material using biotechnology."" This is a different process from selective breeding, which is a natural process that occurs through the selection of desirable traits in a population.

As a botanist, I can tell you that the term ""GMO"" is often used to refer to organisms that have been genetically modified using recombinant DNA technology. This technology involves the transfer of genes from one species to another, or the alteration of genes within a species, to create a new trait or characteristic. This is different from selective breeding, which involves the selection of desirable traits within a population through breeding and selection.

It's important to note that the term ""GMO"" is often used in a way that is misleading or inaccurate. It's not uncommon for people to use the term ""GMO"" to refer to any genetically modified organism, regardless of the method used to create it. However, this is not accurate, as there are many different methods used to create genetically modified organisms.

As a society, we need to be more precise and accurate in our language when it comes to discussing genetic modification. We need to recognize that genetic modification is a complex and multifaceted field, and that the term ""GMO"" is not a sufficient description of the many different methods and techniques used to create genetically modified organisms.

In conclusion, while it is true that selective breeding is a form of genetic modification, it is not the same as genetic modification using recombinant DNA technology. The term ""GMO"" is often used inaccurately to refer to any genetically modified organism, regardless of the method used to create it. As a society, we need to be more precise and accurate in our language when it comes to discussing genetic modification."," selective breeding is GMO, but in the context of product labeling (at least in the US) they can't say that it's GMO. Your half right
freakyjaz: I’m 100% right.  You are reading an industry biased definition.

Here, take Wikipedia, that’s pretty easy:

Also Wikipedia Really?
freakyjaz: Babydoll, this is literally what I spend most of my work time on. I thoroughly understand what gmo is. I just don’t want to see falsehoods perpetuated on the general public. You believe what you want, ok?
PM_BEANS_: Ok it's doesn't even really matter it's just a definition anyway. But I must say that you are infact very freaky.
freakyjaz: Okay… we could always approach it the other way. 
Name a gmo approved in the US….
PM_BEANS_: Why?
PM_BEANS_: I'm not an expert
freakyjaz: Well, that way we could ground-truth your definition.  See if it holds up.
PM_BEANS_: I'm just a guy who looked a bunch of stuff up and proved a self proclaimed expert wrong. You can't seem to except that because of corporate funding BS or something else. I'm sorry this conversation had to devolve to this but get a life.
freakyjaz: You proved nothing other than misinformation is rampant.  We should all be trying to recognize that, as it is destroying our society.

If you still think you are right, simply name a gmo approved in the US and we can examine it. Otherwise, gracefully bow out.
PM_BEANS_: More than 90% of all soybean cotton and corn acreage in the U.S. is used to grow genetically engineered crops. Other popular and approved food crops include sugar beets, alfalfa, canola, papaya and summer squash. More recently, apples that don't brown and bruise-free potatoes were also approved by the FDA.
freakyjaz: Good! Would you like to pick one? (Were there no dogs?)

Maybe that’s enough ground-truthing for one day. I have to get started on my kinky supper now anyway.
PM_BEANS_: Why do I have to pick one I don't understand how that's relevant to the conversation.
freakyjaz: So you could explore why it’s gmo.
