The game originated from an ancient Indian game and evolved into its current form in Europe by the end of the 15th century. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, rendering it unable to escape capture. Chess involves no hidden information, chance, or dice rolls.\n\nThe game begins with White moving first, followed by alternating turns with Black. Each type of piece has unique movement rules, and players must use strategy and foresight to outmaneuver their opponent. Games can end in checkmate, draw, or resignation.\n\nChess has become a globally popular game with millions of players worldwide. It has a rich history of organized competition, including world championships and international tournaments governed by FIDE. The game has also significantly influenced various fields such as art, culture, mathematics, and computer science.\n\nChess theory has developed extensively over time, and the advent of powerful chess engines has further advanced strategic understanding.
