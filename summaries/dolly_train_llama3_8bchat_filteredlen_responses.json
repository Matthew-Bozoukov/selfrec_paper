The boat will start to rise up out of the water because the water is pushing it up. This is because the water is taking up space that the boat would normally be taking up, so the water is \"lifting\" the boat up.\n\nThe reason this happens is because the water is pushing down on the boat with a force that is equal to the weight of the water that the boat is pushing out of the way. So, if you have a toy boat that weighs 1 pound, and it pushes out 1 pound of water, then the water will push back up on the boat with a force of 1 pound, making it rise up. This is what Archimedes' principle is all about - the idea that the weight of the water that an object displaces is equal to the weight of the object itself.",
